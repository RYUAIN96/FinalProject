      "1 I went to this place a couple of days after going to Seoul Food Meat Company, and I personally liked this place more. The chicken was nice and crunchy and had the perfect amount of sauce, and they were spicy! A nice plus since I really enjoy spicy food. My family and I ordered a few appetizers, wings, and one entree and it was definitely enough for all us. Out of the appetizers I recommend getting the potstickers half and half, they're a nice treat!\n",

      "3 Tried it here today for an afternoon snack.  Got the signature fried chicken with picked radishes.  I had the combo with drums and wings and chose 1/2 and 1/2 on the sauces.  The garlic soy was so amazing.  The spicy was really spicy. I like spicy food and for fried chicken it was more spicy than I liked.  I figured I would not like the picked radishes but the server recommended then and they were nice.  They have beer and wine and the place was much nicer than I expected.  Will definitely go back soon.  That shopping center is turning into a great place for many casual dining places.\n",

      "4 This place has pretty good chicken, but eating with my family all but me and my sister ate the wings we ordered. I didn't know what I wanted when we ordered because they had us order in less than one minute after we sat down and got the menus. Then my sister gets a salad as everyone gets a lot of wings. I wait till they come back to check if we were doing good and I order the Chicken Katsu without the mayo. She says that is good and leaves to go start making the Katsu, or so I thought. And just to be stated there was a group about to leave and another looking at the menu. We wait till after everyone else is almost done eating, roughely 15 to 20 minutes later, when someone else comes up to our table. We make sure that they got my order and they say that they didn't. So I then tell him my order again buffet he leaves before I get to say that I wouldn't like mayo. He still doesn't have the cooks start to make my meal. Sooner after he comes back to the tables, roughely 5 minutes later, and he asks to make sure he has the right order, now he stays for the whole order. He then leaves, now starting to make my meal. Now my sister starts eating a few peanut butter crackers because her salad was not much food and she accidentally drops one on the ground, they  don't offer to help but instead stand at the counter and  laugh at her. When about 10 more minutes till the Katsu finally gets to the table. It doesn't even taste that good and is all ready cold. So overall THIS PLACR IS MUCH OVER RATED!\n",

      "5 Was so expecting to like it after hearing radio commercials for a month claiming how good their award winning chicken wings are.  Great service by Phoebe. Great looking restaurant with inside and patio seating.  Now the down side.  We started with fried calamari - batter was very thick and calamari very chewy.  Bland taste with no dipping sauces.  My son had popcorn chicken that looked like they just took everything from the bottom of the deep fryer and put it on a plate.  I had Chicken Katsu with again a very thick batter/coating.  I've had Chicken Katsu at many other Korean Restaurants around the country and Katsu traditionally has a very thin fried coating.  We might try again with just carry out for those 'award winning wings'\n",

      "6 Had mixed feelings about this place. But their bulgogi tacos and fried chicken changed my mind right away. It was really crispy, as it should be, and the sauce was great. They weren't joking when they said SPICY. My father had the glass noodle dish with vegetables. I didn't like it personally because of the sesame oil but if that's your thing, go ahead. Service was great, restaurant was clean, recommend to anyone looking for some good fried chicken.\n",

I'm usually a picky eater so Im always removing something from a dish, but I felt adventurous. I didn't remove the slaw from the tacos. No regrets! The tacos are good and one of the lower calorie items on the menu.\n",

      "The edamame was a generous portion, and cooked and salted perfectly even as to go.  The tenders were delicious, uniques crispy like a batter or breading I haven't seen before.  The only reason they are 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would've liked more sauce on the tenders. Or even a side.  Sauce was very good, but too little of it.\n",

Good portion size, authentic flavors and came in a good amount of time. Staff was courteous and respectful, the atmosphere was pleasant. My only critique was the cost- for a $15+ plate of bulgogi, kimchi should be included on the side. I've never been to a Korean restaurant (in America or Korea) that charged $2.75 for a side of kimchi. It's a staple like ketchup or relish!! That being said, the kimchi was delicious.\n",

      "17 I had heard about Bonchon Korean Fried Chicken via WBT radio ad. I'm not really a fan of Asian cuisine, but since I REALLY love fried chicken-especially wings- I decided to stop in for a to-go order.  There's no doubt that these wings were very crispy and had the best crunch of any I've had, even after probably losing some of the crunch during the trip home. I ordered both spicy and soy garlic. Now, I love hot spicy, but these were almost too hot for me; the soy-garlic were top notch. We didn't care for the pickled radish that was included as a side, so I'll just let them keep that the next time. The wings have a distinct flavor due to the oil that they use - so they're not going to be exactly like typical southern fried chicken & wings. I'll def go back and dine in. The restaurant is quaint, has a bar, covered outdoor seating and the staff that I came in contact with were very friendly.\n",

If you are someone who does not like spicy food please do not order this as it is hard to enjoy your food when your tongue is on fire. I like trying new things and I have a high tolerance for pain and I do enjoy spicy food but this was beyond that. I couldn't even eat all of it and contemplated if I wanted a to-go box. \n",

      "22 5 stars for the food. 0 for service.  We went on Tuesday night at 8 pm of last week. The place was quiet. Only one other table.  We ordered 4 appetizers and spicy chicken for main course. The appetizers came out quickly.  We almost finished our appetizers and a couple came in.  We waited about 30 minutes, still no chicken and our server was no where to be seen (there were 2 servers that night. One had only one table and ours had us and the new table).  Waited about 30 more minutes and our server came out with chicken but brought to the table that came after us.  They looked surprised but ate a piece of chicken each then pushed the rest aside.  I watched them since I had a feeling that they were our order. \n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, our drinks were still not filled once and we were wondering why after an hour, we still didn't get our chicken.  The server walked by so we flagged her to asked about our order.  She looked back to the other table and probably just realized that she had brought our food to the wrong table.  She said nothing then went to the computer probably to check the order then went into the kitchen.  After a few minutes, she told us unapologetically that it would be another 30 minutes because they ran out of chicken. Enough said. We canceled the order, paid for the appetizers and left. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a former server, I understand, mistakes happen.  But she had 2 tables the whole time. We didn't expect our server to be chatty but our drinks never got filled, she did not smile once and she never checked on our table the whole an hour+ that we were there.  Again, we liked the food and we would most likely go back but the service will need to be improved or we'll just order take out from now on.\n",

I absolutely love their Fried Rice...it's always so fresh and full of flavor; and their double-fried Chicken is simply the Bomb. Too much so...it gives you that guilt residue afterwards. Not sure if I liked the Americanized pickled version of Kimchi, one of several complimentary sides of choice. With their friendly lunch special, this entire meal with Iced Tea was about 20 bucks...and well worth it. It could have easily served a party of 2! \n",

      "Overall, the meal and service were both pleasant but I'd suggest having smaller portions for a cheaper price for some items. I really wanted to try more things on the menu but most items were $10+ and came with big portions when they could do well as an appetizer or side item. I think if they changed their menu up a little bit, it would allow more flexibility for the customer on what they want to order. Surprisingly the chicken was not the star of the show so I'd also like to see them improving on the quality of their chicken dish since it is called Bonchon CHICKEN. But seriously those pork buns were amazing!\n",

When we ordered the avocado, we asked for cucumbers asked for them on the side and the waitress said that wasn't able- which may be able but she could have also just asked quickly. We ordered anyway and my husband just picked out the cucumbers and put them on my plate. When the tacos out, I waved the waitress for an extra of a spicy mayo and it took her over 5 min to bring it over. Again, we were able to look over that, but we had to have another waitress take away our plates after 10 minutes with no service. We when she did come clear the plates we asked for our check and she said sure I'll take it care for you. And then proceed to completely forget she had any recollection she spoke with us.

When I say I want to be seated she seemed overwhelmed.  I guess she was cause then sits me down and doesn't come back. Period. Meanwhile a young man come in, sit down ,  get asked for their drink order,  and have it. I can tell the waitresses are not on the same page while the ghost waitress gives appetizers to other waitress table. It's disorganized. You can feel the tension. When ANOTHER waitress finally makes it to me I'm over it. I told her no one has waited on me and asked is there a staff shortage. She proceeds to insult the other waitress Asian race and say there's a shortage  of brains.  I ask is it taking awhile for food to come out and she says yes. I then proceed to exit.

The House fried rice had plenty of fresh veggies just like I like and excellent flavor. I loved how colorful it was. I'm trying to cut back on what I eat and already had way to many carbs so I decided to get the shrimp shumai steamed. I really wanted the fried. It was delicious but I know the fried was very tasty. The next time I will get the Korean wings which I heard was deeeelliccious.\n",

      "47 Not authentic korean food. Seeing that its main focal point is korean cuisine. You would expect that they would use korean white sticky rice, but sadly they used jasmine rice. Also at first glace the name is very confusing. It looks like the korean word for side dish (banchan ). Our waiter was extremely slow. Overall our experience was very disappointing.\n",

It's like they were boiled before they fried them and that was a big problem to because it took the flavor away from them. After eating them, because I was hungry, I found myself in the bathroom for at the least 45 minutes. I kept having to go to the restroom through out the whole night and that was a problem. \n",

Their fried chicken is so good. We like to get the spicy kind. The chicken is crispy and not soggy at all. Even if you microwave it, it's still crispy! I always get a side of white rice with it. I did get a side order of kimchi and it was just ok. I could do without it. My husband got the japchae and he thought it was ok. We have also tried the chicken rice cake and it's definitely not worth $14. There was hardly any rice cakes in it and I just didn't like that they put cheese on it. It does not go together. But definitely 4 stars for the fried chicken!\n",

I was so excited that bulgogi was on the menu so we ordered that, Korean fried chicken(1/2 and 1/2) and kimchi coleslaw. The bulgogi was disappointing and bland, the chicken was too salty tasting, and the kimchi coleslaw was just regular coleslaw with some kimchi added.\n",

The grill is horrible, really do need more maintenance or even change a new one. All the meats that we order were cook with very low heat which dried it out when it's cooking (yes, we did turn the grill to highest heat). Also the kitchen takes a while to prepare meat dishes, so there was a long pause between each time that we put in order.

I read one review that was negative and found it to be unfounded regarding quality. The ambiance is very bare and plain, but I review the food and the service typically, and I only comment on ambiance. For 7 of us with combi #6 plus lamb and shrimp, 2 bottles of soju, 2 bottles of magkoli and 2 sodas, the bill came out to $32 each including tip. We feasted.

I was pretty disappointed overall though. Only 4 side dishes were included: kimchi, bean sprouts, fish cakes, and seaweed (not sure cause I forgot to try it). Not only that, but they weren't very good. I know kimchi tastes better when it's fermented longer, but idk. This kimchi looked very old and didn't taste that great either. The fish cakes were also pretty bad. I had a feeling the fish cakes were possibly undercooked. On top of all that, there weren't any air vents which made it difficult to stay and eat. The entire restaurant was incredibly stuffy due to the smoke The good thing about this place is it's a bit more affordable compared to Manna or Gen.

Many places also make this dish greasy but this one was just right.  I also like that they has mushrooms which I have never seen in this dish.  Also the amount on the plate was surprising.  Other places don't give a lot but we had a lot to take home.\n",

      "121 We used to come here all the time several years ago when it used to be Takamatsu but have heard so many terrible things about Arirang about people getting food poisoning, the food being made with expired and low quality ingredients, so we avoided going. Recently, I heard that they changed cooks so my family and I decided to come try their dinner. First of all, their restaurant says it's a sushi bar, but they don't have sushi. Their side dishes looked dull in color and not very appetizing. We ordered mool neng myun which is a icy cold beef broth with noodles and that was lacking so much flavor. Even putting in vinegar, sesame oil, hot mustard, it was still really bland not very good. We also ordered bibim neng myun which is a spicy mixed noodle dish but the sauce was so bland, even when we asked for more sauce to put on the noodles, the flavor didn't change because the sauce was watered down so much. They also use super thin noodles that didn't hold up very well and it just wasn't good as much as we wanted to like it. The galbi seemed ok, my brother ate all of his order. The spicy pork bulgogi didn't taste very good either. The d챕cor inside is really weird, they use garden fencing as d챕cor. The music went from Korean hip hop to acoustic Justin Beiber and it was just weird. Overall, the experience and food was very lacking and we won't be going back. There are way better Korean restaurants nearby that have good food and better atmosphere.\n",

That was at 7:51pm For the call an when we arrived to the store an sat down, that was approximately 7:57pm. I told the waitress we had a order placed over the phone to dine in an she said no problem let me check if it's ready but never came back. Waitress never asked us what to drink or anything! I was pretty shocked! Another server stopped by an handed us the side dishes and walked away. At that moment, I didn't know who was my server at this point. At 8:13 a waitress passed by we asked if we can get water. She then went to the back an served us the water shortly after that. Now, 8:17 the food comes out. I was mind blown. The meat was not sizzling off the tray. Meat was cold an onions was not grilled. Now keep in mind I've been coming to this place before the new owner an new name. That entree is normally $25 in cost an has a portion to eat for two! The plate I received today was tiny for a child to eat, seriously. I asked to speak to the manager to the waitress an she brought him out. He ask what was wrong with the plate? I said honestly I called to order the food to have it ready by the time I get there. I was not expecting it to be ready as I arrived but did not expect my food to come out almost 20 min either. Plate was not hot, meat was definitely cold. An the manager looked at me with no intentions of apologizing. But he did have a excuse stating originally the cooks placed it in a to go box, and transferred it back onto a plate. So my question to him was, so my food was out while we was sitting an waiting the entire time? He said to me that's correct! Ooookkkk an I asked so what are you going to do about this an he said well I can remake it? That's not the answered I wanted, I was expecting an apology but yet never got it. I looked at him an was in complete shock on how he did not resolve the problem an told him I would not pay for the food nor service. He said ok an yet still never apologized an I asked if I can speak to the owner or get his contact number. He told me he was the owner. Funny because I went there a month ago an another gentlemen older told me the same thing which he was more positive in the store and checked on every table to make sure everyone was satisfied. So he was not the only owner an told him I wanted to talk to him. He refused to give me the contact an I told him flat out.... guess you are going to receive a yelp review by me! New name, and new owner.... I would never recommend anyone to eat at this place. The servers are all new with no serving experience, just like the owner!\n",

      "Funny how you can you can tell me you check the cameras an reviewed my comments but you can apologize  now but not in person? Sure you can say we ate 75% of the food as well when you have only 13 pieces of beef on the plate an I was accompanied with my lady. We can agree to disagree on the time the food came out on upon arrival although still the service you and servers gave us was terrible! Btw here is an image of the food from your competitor down the street from you, who served us Bulgogi. We left your company to eat at Gogi ( Better Food & Better Service) same night.\n"

I remember going here with my family on a Friday night at around 8 pm and we had asked for kimchi and our waiter said sorry but our chef is making some fresh kimchi...

The second time there was one other table when I arrived. Me and my boyfriend sat down and waited 10 minutes for a menu. When we ordered what we wanted we received our food in 10 minutes and had to wait another just to get water, we asked for water 3 times. Our server kept asking what he was already told several times, we got our water about 20 minutes after walking in the door. Our server proceeded to move the other guest to a different table upon request. When we put in our second order with 3 different items to our first he came back with the same 2 times as our first order which we did not want, when we told him he never came back with our second order but came back which another tables order and we told him we didn't order it and he asked if we wanted to keep it. We denied. We never received our second order, never received service after denying the other guests food. We were at this restaurant for 1 hour and never got anything but water and our first round of food. As we left and asked to speak with a manager he told me that they would speak with me momentarily, I waited 30 minutes standing in the lobby and never actually got to speak with a manager but had my server complain about his job.

The food was amazing bc the soup itself was real and the meat was so soft and tender. We began with the korean traditional side dishes (called banchan) for starters such as kimchi, cucumber, jabchae, etc... I became a big fan of this restaurant and I would definately go back again.  Also, their service was prompt and great.\n",

They were not busy and employees were just standing there. Also our waiter clocked out on his shift and he did not inform about it so we were waiting  10 to 15 minutes for our orders with the grill still on until we asked another waiter about it. He informed us about our waiter's status and we were shock about it.  The meats were all frozen and they didn't give us a lot squid but a lot vegetable with 5 small pieces of squid. Also we told the manger about our experiences and he didn't care . Yeahhhh.... I'm not coming back and will definitely will tell my friends and family relatives about this experience.\n",

      "157 Terrible experience. Chicken was dry, portions of the fried chicken were cold.  Dumplings came out as a shrimp stew instead. When it came back from the kitchen, it tasted like they just fished the shrimp out and dropped some dumplings in. On a Saturday night, the front portion of the restaurant was closed so we could not order a cold beer.  Music playing in the background was a rap and R&B mix (strange).  Server showed his displeasure when we returned the items that weren't right. At one point both the male and female servers were taking shots with people at table next to ours. One of the females at the table was completely drunk (over-served) That's a violation of AZ Liquor Laws. I didn't eat the food. Looking forward to stopping by Jack in the Box drive through once we leave here. We will never come back.\n",

The manager is really nice and gave us free things to make up for the service. Music was loud as was the group of teenagers next to us who were screaming and banging on the table. The meat was served extremely slow. We got our menus after being seated for 25 minutes, got our food after 40 minutes. Portion sizes are small, pork belly is cheap quality, marinated meats are okay. You have to pay an extra $3 per order for the classics and best cuts like galbi and ribeye. The small dishes are small and good for literally one bite. Not to mention the grills are not covered underneath and I actually got burnt multiple times because my legs are long. Would not come here again for at least a few months. Manna is your place to go.

We told them several times we already ordered and got this...\n",

      "We were served our food. The meats are very low quality, sauces they have wasn't great nor good either. They gave me msg plus salt on the side. Everything tasted plain. It's $14 a person for all you can eat. So who can complain right? It's cheap so therefore the quality of the food you're eating is what you paid for. That's why there's a saying you get what you paid for. The service was good but could be better because I feel like they dont communicate on which server should take care of which customer. There's also too many of them so I get it they're probably trying to keep busy and probably bored. Other than that I won't be coming back. Sorry to say this is the worst kbbq ever. Food was just horrible and I am just being honest here.\n",

The walls are all decorated with people's sharpie phrases, signatures and drawings. Some are funny, some are philosophical, some are lame, and some just are.\n",
      "The tables are clean, but the inside of the grill controls are yucky. Clean those bad boys! Speaking of the grills, it's like pulling teeth to get a grill change. That would mean that your server would have to visit you once and a while. With a 2 hour BBQ limit, I can see how they make money. If they only visit you once or twice in the two hours, you barely eat anything, and you have no waste, because you're still starving. No one asks about drinks. You get one little plastic water bottle that is mostly ice, and shot glasses to serve it. For a table of 5, this is unacceptable.\n",
      "The meats were pretty good. There wasn't much in the way of seafood, and every time (we've been twice now) I have asked for the squid, they don't have it. The steamed egg is tasteless. The gyoza is greasy. The tempura veggies were uncooked. If you get a hot green tea, it is served in a molten lava temperature pot with no handle. Like I said, you never see your server. We received incorrect meats, incorrect portions, and no grill changes. \n",

They also don't have Galbi on the menu anymore. After walking in, one of the servers took our order, and shortly after, another came to take our order again. While I really believe that the server was very courteous and apologetic, the organization of the servers is seriously lacking. Food was forgotten left and right, and it seemed like they did not communicate with each other at all. Additionally, they were out of romaine lettuce and shrimp, which was very disappointing. Food was mediocre, and only 4 banchan sides, which is on the lower end. Probably would not return, but would like to check out the other K BBQ restaurants in the area.\n",

I went last weekend and we shared a chicken and a beef bento box as usual. The pieces of meat were just low quality (tendons and just tough), room temperature, and weren't sliced nicely. I guess the soup and sides were still decent. I remember a box was 4 bucks back in primary school, and its been raising since...now its $7 - $7.25...that's a bit much considering the quality decline. Okay, and then I used to love the pork bone soup here although it was never authentically korean. But wow, this time, there was barely any meat on the few bones, a few chunks of hard uncooked potatoes, a few pieces of shred cabbage, and the broth tasted artificial - it was spicy but lacked any meat flavour. It costed $10.  I would probably still go to the DT location for their lunch KBBQ for 15 dollars probably.\n",

It's the cheapest Korean Grill out there but make sure you get the beef ribs because that's the best thing they have. ($18.99 on weekdays) It is not authentic Korean-grill food at all, but you get what you pay for. Don't bother paying an extra $3 for the vegetables because it's not worth it, the pineapples are canned. This place is extremely busy but the service wasn't bad.

      "200 I really like this location better than the other locations. There's always a table open for me and my friends and it's never too crowded or loud. During the lunch menu there isn't any beef short ribs which was kindof a let down because my friends and I really only like the sliced beef, short ribs and chicken. My advice is to just skip seafood all together, it's not worth the pain. In general seafood at kbbq is never that great and usually falls apart or doesn't taste that great so unless you're a big seafood lover you can do without it. As for side dishes, the kimchi is always on point and so are the radishes and sliced potatoes. Depending on what day during the week you go, sometimes you'll find the portions are a lot smaller than usual. The first time I went they had pretty big cuts of meat but the last time I went the cuts were very small and thin but that's not an issue since it's AYCE you can just order more. PSA if you're paying with debit they charge you like $2 more so if you're ballin on a budget bring some cash!! Definitely recommend this place if you want some good kbbq\n",

I can see why the place is packed with customers and others who would squirm in to get a table on a busy night. For $13.95 (adult), all-you-can-eat menu, it includes pork, chicken, beef (kalbi short ribs/Bulgogi or marinated BBQ beef), ox tongue, ox liver, salmon, squid, and fish fillet. An extra $3 for lamb and shrimp. And an all-you-can drink for $1.95 (choice of juice/soda). \n",

The waiter was young, incompetent, and coped an extremely bad attitude. When we flagged him for water, meat, etc., he would literally mumble underneath his breath with a nasty expression. When we ordered a pitcher of ginger ale, he claimed they couldn't do a pitcher which was solely for juice or beer. When we asked for refills, viola, he came out with a magic pitcher to refill our cups. It would had saved him a load of work if he just served us the pitcher from the get-go. We had a different waiter who would tend to us since he kept disappearing.  \n",

      "Although, it's not an authentic Korean BBQ place, the food and concept is relatively the same. The joint is owned by Vietnamese staff. The place itself functions like a prep station similar to a factory: Flag the next customer and get them seated, carry out trays of all-you-can eat meats, refill their drinks, clean/wipe table, etc. It's apparent that the staff feels quite disgruntled since they are being overworked for meager wages. However, it's not an excuse for treating their customers poorly. Definitely try the Queens St location for friendlier service!\n"

It's just general idea of sitting down in front of a hot grill in the middle of the night, watching your food cook and the wonderful smell. The food here is alright. Nothing to be excited about. For an AYCE, I guess the price is considered decent. They have a night owl special (10pm-close) for those of you who go out late. For $12.99, the meat selection is cut in half. In my most honest opinion, it's not worth it. Because I love my ribs, salmon, and sausage. The ribs is really the main dish. Has anyone noticed that their beef has gotten worse over the years? It's a huge chunk of bad quality beef with no fat. WHERE'S THE FAT?!  And their side dishes..it was awful. Radish had no crunch to it, the kimchi was watered down. Potato - didn't they used to serve some sweet honey potato? What happened? \n",

At first we thought it was because they were busy, but when we started to look around and observe what was going on, my bf and I realize that the servers at this location cater to their Asian customers before anyone else...

The service was all right since the restaurant was full of customers. The waiters kept walking by to keep taking our orders, refilling our cups with drinks, and they were very friendly as well. The marinade for the meat was very decent. There are a  lot of selection in the All You Can Eat Menu such Salmon, Beef Ribs, Squid, Chicken, Beef, Pork, etc.  The side dishes that come along with the meal (Kimchi, Tofu, Bean Sprouts, Beef Bone Broth) were nice compliments with the meal. I will keep coming to this location due to its location in the Scarborough area.\n",

      "229 OMG I am actually a fan along with the rest of my family LOL ~ We have been coming here at least every other weekend for lunch after Saturday school since we were little kids (they used to have wooden tables and chairs, white framed fake windows, with more fake vines and beer bottles). We always order the bento boxes with grilled chicken, pork, or beef which came with beef soup, rice, bean sprouts, potatoes, a free soft drink...and it used to cost like $4 ...but now its like $6 I think :(. It's really inexpensive still, delicious, and filling! I also order the bibimbap and pork bone soup with potatoes once in a while. The bibimbap was mediocre at the very most, but the pork bone soup is one of my favourites ever. It might not be the most authentic, but it is so flavourful, has lots of meat, nappa cabbage, and potato chunks...also comes with some yummy sides! And OMG, the AYCE BBQ lunch is so worth, I think it's like $12 and everything is seasoned so well (I love the fish fillet) and the sides are awesome too.\n",

      "230 A low 4 stars.  I've been to this place twice so far. Both were late night visits.  And the first time I tried the fancy AYCE with all the options.  We enjoyed both the pork and beef options but weren't too keen on the shrimp and seafood were okay.   The shrimp comes with full skin, head and vein so it's quite a hassle...but the minimal offer of side dishes (esp the kimchi and radish) are great and it's a great low carb eat option for me.  Meats are of average quality so they are good when cooked thoroughly and eaten right away.  A star lost because the seafood options could be done better and the meats could be of better quality.   Just order the regular all you can eat and get pork and beef, cook and eat right away and you will be fine.\n"

      "239 i was so disappointed with this korean grill house. i went on a saturday night. originally from looking at the reviews and menu online, me and my friends believed that the night owl special was 11.99, but the waiter persisted to tell us that they changed it & it's now 17.99. Kind of a bummer cause we were going for the low price. we continued to be seated down & started to place our order for drinks. two of my friends ordered soft drinks & i ordered a water. the waiter told us that my two friends can only get canned drinks ($2) because i'm getting a water. unlimited refilled drinks are $2.25 ... i don't want to be forced into buying a soft drink. i don't like soda. i hate the fizz. He then brought me my water & THE CUP WAS DISGUSTING. that was 1 strike for me. going on with our night , we continued to order our meats (17.99 gave us chicken , beef & pork slices & fish fillet). one of my friends are allergic to fish, so we asked that he didn't get it, but once again , the guy proceeded to say that everyone must order the same things at the same table. it's 17.99 with or without fish. i don't understand why he just couldn't bring one serving of it. When we placed our food on the grill, it burnt instantly; our grill was way too hot. With all my anger built up with this place, i just went to the bathroom to try and escape the night for a little. However, when i came across the bathroom, the disgust of it matched the customer service. This was my 2nd strike. Coming back to my seat to try & rush through the rest of our night, we finished our first round of meat & wanted a second round. there was a little button you can press to request a waiter at our table . we pressed this button 100 times & no one showed up at our table. the button is completely useless. we waited like 30 min for a waiter to come and acknowledge we wanted more meat. When he went to get it, he took forever to bring it back out to us. Our appetite was kind of gone at this point. & i was just done for the rest of the night (strike 3). The meat wasn't well marinated; it was completely bland. The rice was hard & cold. The beef broth was gross. The kimchi was alright lol. We went to pay our bills & one of my friends was paying debit. They were charging $1 for using the debit machine & he was pissed that they couldn't mention it to him before. i do understand that some machines charge a fee, but it would be nice that they told us all the terms & conditions before the night started. I would most definitely choose chakos over korean grill house. this was my first & will be my last time ever going here. My bill here was $50 (2 people) vs at Chako's it was $56 (2 people) & at Chakos , we at least got better service , nice drinks , the meats we requested & a nice atmosphere with enough elbow space. i will never come here again.\n"

It's a great place for anyone who wants to try something different from your everyday sit-and-be-served restaurant.

      "\n",
      "Second of all, I come here for the value. It's cheaper than AYCE sushi. Every once in a while, you just want to stuff yourself with meat. This is one of the best places to do it because you can hang out with your friends or family while cooking together. \n",
      "\n",

      "I'd say the quality of meat you get is generally worse than what you get at Korean places. But that's more than made up with quantity. The seasoning is slightly off. Also, the side dishes are definitely way off the mark. But you didn't come here for the side dishes. You came here for mountains of meat. Get ready to feel meat sweats after eating here. And make sure you don't wear nice clothes. You'll smell like BBQ after and want a shower.\n",

They use a paper ordering system for your ayce picks, customer marks how many of each item they wish.  For the late night offering, it is beef, chicken, pork, fish, squid & pork belly.  Drinks are extra @ $2.25 for aycd.  Wife and I selected chicken, pork and squid.  We filled out the paper 3 times and we never received our squid.  Our first order of chicken and pork was short of 1 tray each.  the Banchan (side dishes) were kinda sad to say the least..tried the tofu, sprouts, radish & Kimchee.  Didnt get enough the banchan servings were smaller than other places we have been to.  The first bowls of rice we were served were tasty..however the 2nd set of rice ordered was different.

I really have no idea how they can get away with the serious burn-risk temperature units that are located right under the cooking grill that nearly burned my knee. I mean the metal panel is scorching hot and clearly dangerous, but the place was full of people, including lots of children. The food was pretty good and they offer a good variety for the price of the all-you-can-eat menu. Their water glasses are plastic and really small but there isn't a whole lot of room on the tables anyway. The service was quick and friendly and probably the best part of the meal. I went with a group (somebody else chose the location) but I wouldn't go back because I didn't enjoy having to worry about burning my legs while trying to eat, and also smelling like BBQ afterwards.\n"

Hopefully your arms can still reach the grill and you find comfort in the company you are with.  \n",

Sometimes the wait stuff can be slow, i like to think its because of the amount of people in the restaurant but that is more out of kindness and not in line with reality. Regardless, you do receive your food on time. ( FYI : IF YOU ORDER A REFILLABLE SOFT DRINK, YOU WILL NEED TO BEG AND PLEAD TO HAVE THAT REFILLED, BE WARNED ) \n",

You are cooking the meat so you have the freedom to either devour that cow in a second or create a beautiful display on your plate, the choice is yours. Taste, if you eat the meat alone, aside from the short ribs, I don't really see that much flavour coming from the food.

      "\n",
      "To begin, the service is okay. I mean, there's a bunch of waiters that will be helping you out. Majority of them are nice, but make sure you look at what they are giving you, because sometimes they can get confused. However, the waiter did let us know that the tips were included, which is a huge plus because some Korean bbq places do not tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place itself is alright. I personally feel like it's so crowded in there that you can literally hear other people's conversations around you. Also, the washrooms are pretty gross! So I suggest you don't use it unless you really have to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was alright. I personally loved the beef and thought it was the best to cook. Ribs were also good, but the beef was better. One sad thing is that this place does not have dessert, not even ice-cream!!\n",

      "260 Korean Grill House is a good place for meat. \n",
      "Meat meat meat, lotsa meat. Meat is how I live, meat is how I roll, and this place is full. of. Meat. \n",
      "This location of Korean Grill house is in a small plaza off midland Ave, so it's fairly hard to park, which is a small downside. the inside of the restaurant houses a lot of people, and it's always packed, so you have to wait to get a seat. \n",
      "You have either the choice of an all-you-can-eat grill, or a lunch bento box (at lunch). Being a regular customer after church, I come here (it's in the area) and usually get the bento box, as I'm starving after service. It's a fairly stable meal choice, with the choices of several kinds of meat at about 8-12 dollars each, with rice, tofu, a bunch of Asian veggies, and of course MEATTTT MEATMEATMEATMEATTTTTTTTT!!!!! sorry. \n",
      "I find the beef is either very very very  good or satisfactory, and is a risky choice to make, depending on the chef that is cooking your food, which you have no control over. I usually order the chicken, which is seasoned and marinated to perfection, with a good portion given to you. However, I find you sometimes have too much rice, and end up being able to have one bite of rice and one bite of meat, or vice versa, and have to finish your meat with no rice to mellow out the rich taste (though too much meat is fine :D) I wouldn't recommend getting anything else as they don't season those enough in  my opinion. \n",
      "As for the all-you-can-eat grill, it's super cheap, at what I remember of something like 13 dollars for one adult? anyways they give you tons of options of MEATTTT including beef, chicken, salmon for one deal and I think if you add 2 dollars for everyone you get Lamb and shrimp, which you should do, I mean it's only 2 dollars...\n",
      "You don't want to pass down the grilled beef, as it's in delicately sliced slices, marinated with a sharp eye for taste (or should I say a sharp tongue), and completely delicious. The grill all in all is great. \n",
      "The service is mediocre, which is the only reason I'm taking off a star, since sometimes your order gets mixed up and/or it takes a year to get to your table at lunch. \n",
      "All in all it's a great place to go if you want meat, but not a great place for vegetarians and vegans :D. If I ever feel the craving for tons of grilled meat, I'm coming here.\n"

It's required that you order two portions and you can't mix and match (ex: 1 order of chicken 1 order of beef), but it's ok!! It's still pretty cheap and it's good enough to share. Came in super hungry and thought we didn't order enough food and was thinking of getting a side of kimchi rice but good thing we didn't because the 2 orders of spicy dakgalbee was enough! Definitely coming back here again!\n",

      "294 Decided to try Joons after reading some reviews on their DaK Gal Bee (JS-1). Service was very friendly and quick, I especially like how they leave a bottle of water at your table so you don't have to constantly ask for a refill. The JapChae glass noodles came out quickly but were a bit too sticky for my liking. It made it hard to swallow. The Dak Gal Bee came shortly after and despite all the other reviews it was a good portion size for two people, an overall heavy dish. The ramen noodles were a staple piece, so I definitely recommend getting those as a side. The flavour for both dishes were very sweet so half way through it got too much to finish. In general an alright Korean comfort food restaurant.\n",

Let's get to the point now. The food. It was great. I guess it depends on what toppings you add on but I find that cheese can make most things taste that much better. to be honest,  I am not a ramen or any kind of instant noodle fan. I try to avoid them as much as possible but the images my friends sent me of this place kind of sparked my curiosity. You basically get a pan of ramen which can be shared between 2-3 people depending how many other toppings you add. I feel that once you add them up, it can cost quite a bit. I got the cheese, rice cake, fish cake, veggies and extra ramen for this ramen dish and it was shared among two people. Definitely filled both of us. I think if many of my friends like ramen, I'll come back with them. Only downside is that the ramen was a tad dry. I wish they had more sauce. Other than that, I probably will not come here myself. But definitely had a good experience with an average friendly service.\n",

I think it has to do with how much sauce they add at the beginning because as it cooks and reduces the sauce gets spicier. I found the spiciness enjoyable because it added a kick but wasn't uncomfortable. If my taste buds needed a break I would take a bite of the mashed potato side dish (yummy!). \n",

The server told me that's because they made the soup in the morning and kept it boiling for a whole day. I'm like OK, but this just taste wrong. Then he told me his boss tasted the soup and it tasted perfectly fine, and just left. Well I don't know what the owner eat every day that he thinks the soup that went wrong already taste fine, but i have a normal person's taste so I'm not OK with this shit.

If you can eat spicy food, I highly recommend the Joon's original spicy sauce since it would've definitely enhanced the flavours. I felt that the teriyaki sauce made the DakGalBee taste pretty ordinary, so I was definitely not blown away. I actually disagree with some of the Yelpers below because I felt that the servings were pretty normal. I didn't think that they were small at all, and all the add-ons were plentiful.\n",

Also, each add-on's cost is per entree, so since we ordered two entrees, it was $4.00 for each add-on (which was pretty pricey). If you want to be full, you have to get either the rice or rice cakes. We got the rice cakes, mozzarella cheese, and noodles.

      "324 This is the closest Korean restaurant to my place so I frequent here quite a bit due to convenience. I like their pork bone soup and typically get take out. The wait can be awhile so I usually call ahead of time for takeout. They recently raised the prices a bit but still reasonable for the soups. I know that they are known for their sticky noodles. I personally think that the noodles are a bit overrated and quite overpriced when you consider the add-ons. All the add-ons are not expensive ingredients, but the price can definitely add up per person. If you don't do the add ons, then you don't really have much of a dish. If it's not out of convenience for me, I would prefer venturing down to Yonge and Finch for better Korean food options (at a tad better price points).\n",

      "dak gal bi is $9.25 per portion but you need to order a minimum of 2 portions. Table cooking isn't really meant for an individual. It's for 2 or more people. The $9.25 is the basic which includes the chicken, sauce, and some veggies. You'll probably need to top it off with some extras like rice cake, ramen, or rice. Some of these extras are cooked within the pot. \n",

      "326 They have traditional Korean dishes and then there's the huge pots u see on everyone's tables. So how it works is you order per person. So if you're 3 people, you'll order 3 orders/person of one pan you all decide on unless u all want different ones (they have seafood chicken and beef to chose from). I dislike how you can't order extra noodles which I guess makes sense because they say it's per person but the portions here are so tiny. I'm not exactly sure how they are portioning but it's never enough and actually very little, although very good which is why we always return despite the tiny portions. So you don't necessarily have to order noodles either. Some people just get the proteins with the sauce. After your done eating it, save a bit of sauce and protein etc left and order fried rice. You pay based on bowls or per person. It tastes like bibimbap. I'm giving this place 4 stars because it is delicious and I always return. Would be 5 stars but they lose one due to tiny portions and being a bit pricy for the amount of noodles you get, which isn't filling.\n",

We only added cheese to half of the order and it was definitely enough for that whole pan. It was a bit too cheesy but my boyfriend loves it like that so I wasn't mad. The taste was not anything crazy but I'm a pretty plain person so I don't expect anything blasting with flavor. I don't even dip my chicken nuggets most of the time so that tells you a lot about my poor taste buds. A++ for that amazing dish. I can't stop thinking about it.

When the food came, my finance's first reaction was is that one order or two? (I'm sure you can imagine the portion now) For the price of $12.50 for one order it was definitely not worth it. It only includes chicken and cabbage. We had added ramen and cheese($2 each) and even with those added, the dish was tiny. The side dishes was very mediocre- We had kimchi, potato (very good and creamy), radish and broccoli. \n",

      "Overall:\n",
      "The food was okay, not worth it though for the price we paid. We paid over $30 including tips and for what we had- it was not worth it. We haven't tried DakGalBee in Toronto yet but we ate quite a bit of it when we were in Korea and can't compare.\n",

      "359 Decently good food. Sometimes hard to find parking in that area. Though there are about four designated free parking spots behind the store. More unique Korean food - mainly bring the big sizzling plate - which tastes great especially with cheese and noodle add on, but isn't very good value for money, as it is minimum two portions. So, for a sizzling plate, it is at least$20 and probably$25 after the add ons. This won't get two people full so you need to add another dish of some sort, bring the total up to well over $35 for what is supposed to be a cheap casual restaurant. Oh, and I didn't even include any drinks!\n"

If you did not try Tofu soup, you have to try it. It's a little spicy but just a kick to wake you up from all the cheese you are consuming. Customer service was amazing. We went there for dinner but it was not that busy. It took a little while to get your food but we were chatting so we didn't even notice how time pass. In general, I would give 5 star because the food was nice, the service was relatively good, the place is clean and there is a pay parking at the back of the store which makes it a little easier commute.\n",

      "366 This isn't the first time I ate at Joons, but it would definitely be my last. The only reason I still eat there despite its horrible service and selection of appetizer is because of their table cooking. I'll admit, I like their table cooking selections (I personally go for the chicken one) and along with that I always add a few side dishes to add to it. My typical selection is cheese, noodles x2 since we have two people and sweet potato. As usual, I ordered this except this time the waiter told me in half-understandable English that I can only order one noodle, even if I want to pay extra for it. Okay? So you don't want my money? And what kind of policy is it to not let customer order what they like? Fine, I got over that since it's not such a big deal. As usual, the appetizers did not come until nearly 20 minutes later. And no, asking them for it would not make it any faster. Infact, they had it on the counter all along but still didn't want to give it to you. I can confidently say this is their way of doing things because all four times I went, things never improved. The appetizers consist of: two pieces of broccoli, half a scoop of potato, some kimchi and a few beans. Every time I see it it just makes me not want to go back. Onto the horrendous main course that used to be good: Table Cooking. We decided to try something new today: Tofu Table Cooking. Everything seemed normal until we took a bite at the tofu, it was incredibly sour, not what a NON-EXPIRED tofu should taste like. YUCK! There is a saying that restaurants that are afraid of letting customers eat would not stay open for long, as they oppose the fundamentals of even opening a restaurant. DEFINITELY not recommended!\n",

      "368 I really wanted to adore this place since I had been eyeing it for a while and a friend had hyped it up, so I stopped by on my birthday. First of all, the seating is extremely cramped. The entry way itself, you have to push past lines of people to get out which, after trying the food, I couldn't really fathom why. We really wanted to try the dakgalbi, their speciality, but we were told we couldn't get that unless we ordered TWO of those. Ridiculous! After waiting in line so long and to be forced in to trying to get two huge portions simply for two people is crazy. Maybe the line up was because they try to enforce this rule and so people come in big groups which I think is absolutely silly. We were already here and waited so long that we didn't want to leave. Seeing what little options we had other than the dakgalbi should have been our next clue to leave. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, we opted for a ramen and a soup - both of which were doused in spice, and extremely watered down. Don't get me wrong, I'm South Asian so you know for a fact I'm not afraid of spices whatsoever but it was so much that all you could taste was the spice and nothing else. You literally could not taste anything else, no kimchi, none of the vegetables, not even salt. The ramen was a seafood ramen, but I got a total of one piece of (frozen, still cold) shrimp and two minuscule pieces of mussel. And that was just my ramen! My friend's soup was watered down, and again, all you could taste was tomato and the spiciness. Not even the rice it came with could make it better. \n",
      "\n",
      "The cheapness of the dishes should have been a reflection of the food and we should have stayed away, however it was because it was all so cheaply priced that we didn't feel that ripped off walking out of. The side dishes were also disappointing, specifically the sweet potato mash although it was nice to try a texture different than water. The cleaniless is also another topic on it's own. Flies were flying around and everytime I opened my mouth, I was afraid I would accidentally swallow one so I was consciously minding each bite which is a red flag of it's own. We didn't even finish, paid and simply left. All around disappointment. Stay far, far away especially in such an abundant place like North York where Korean places are a dime a dozen.\n"

We had the one with no seafood and added sweet potato and noodles. We didn't order rice cake, but it came with it too, not sure if there's any to start off with. Although I think the dish will taste a lot more delicious with some spicy sauce, but without it it still taste awesome! The sauce they used was just addicting...kind of like a thick Teriyaki sauce.

      "The meh's: The food was pretty decent, but nothing to write home about. We ordered two portions of the dak gal bee with seafood ($11.75 or so per portion). Seafood is mussels, baby octopus and something else I can't remember. We then added noodles (ramen - $2) and at the end, fried rice ($2.50). I had heard that the portions here were small, but I was hoping for the best. I hoped that with the side dishes, there would be enough for the three of us. Turns out I was woefully mistaken. Should have figured that one out by the number of (not) doggy bags the other customers had. The portions were not tiny, but they were definitely not generous portions. There were only four side dishes (kimchi, sweet potato mash, seaweed salad, pickled carrots and radish), and each came in tiny portions. Most ice cream scoops I've had are bigger than that scoop of sweet potato mash. Thankfully, they did allow us a refill. I was super excited for the fried rice, because the menu says that at the end, they put the rice in for you, add sesame oil and seaweed, then mix it up with the remaining sauce and stuff at the bottom of your pan. As soon as I saw the pan (before they put the rice in), I knew this was going to be sad. There was very little sauce to begin with. I mean, it coated what was in the pan, but unless they added more sauce (which they probably did), there would not be enough for the rice. The rice was NOT worth it. Buy a bowl of steamed rice ($1.50) and mix it in yourself. It's cheaper and pretty much the same. I detected a hint of sesame, but I couldn't find any seaweed. The fried rice aside, for two portions of seafood dak gal bee, there was only 1 mussel. Does this mean that each portion only gets 1/2 a mussel? The logic there makes me sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The downsides: Menu is quite limited. I prefer restaurants where I can order a zillion different things to eat. Already mentioned the portions above. Will reiterate. At a lot of Korean restaurants where you do your own table top cooking, or share an entree, especially those that say they're for two people, there's usually a lot of food (like enough to feed 3 hungry people or 4 average/small eaters). This was enough for two. We were going to order a bibimbap, but when we placed the order, the server came back to us immediately and apologized that they were out of cooked rice for which to make our bibimbap. This was at 7:15pm. This has never happened to me before. An Asian restaurant running out of cooked rice... wow. They were making more, but we did not want to wait for it. My parents were satisfied (as in no longer hungry), but I was about 55-60% full. \n",

Even though Joons is known for their dakgalbee, an awesome carb-y combo of rice cake, cheese, and rice and/or ramen, we opted against it this time around so they wouldn't have to go back into the office smelling like spicy cheese. Instead, we ordered the vegetable soft tofu soup, bulgogi noodles, and the spicy chicken rice. My friend originally wanted to warm up with some pork bone soup, but they didn't have it ready yet when we got in shortly after 11:30. We were told the wait would be about an hour for it, which I guess is a mixed blessing as any soup that takes an hour plus to prepare must be relatively authentic. The food was pretty good, but the conversation was better. My favourite was the spicy chicken rice and Joons' mashed potato side dish. Prices are great, lunch for under $15 with tax and tip, but they don't accept credit here, only debit and cash. The meal was fine while we were eating, but settled heavily and a bit uncomfortably a couple hours later, just something to keep in mind - and I have a pretty cast-iron stomach!\n",

I'm actually not the biggest fan of the rice cakes there as I find them a bit plain - the noodles with mozzarella cheese have much more chewiness to them as well as flavour.

We did find that it gets a bit boring after a while that's the only downfall with this type of 'two orders minimum' style of dining.

I always get the Dak Gal Bee (either JS1 with chicken or JS2 which has addtional seafood) and enjoy both. I see many others complaining about the size of the portions, but I find them to be enough. Two portions for two people for lunch was more than sufficient, and even two portions for three people for dinner plus a side of dumplings was fine too. The best way to enjoy this dish: make sure you add on rice cakes, cheese and instant noodles. The rice cakes are deliciously chewy, and the instant noodles help soak up all the extra sauce (made the mistake of not getting noodles the first time, and it was just way too saucy and salty.) Plus you just can't go wrong with extra cheese. :D While some traditionalists might argue that this isn't the most authentic way to enjoy Dak Gal Bee, I still say the add ons are what make the dish good here!\n",

You also have to pay $2.00 for each add-on, with options such as: rice cakes, mozzarella cheese, and ramen noodles, which are all MUST HAVES in my opinion.

The placemat on the table pleasantly was their review from Toronto life which I read before my dinner came out.  For their banchan they had 4 nice dishes (one radish with light red pepper flavour, one sprouts, one pasta and potato salad with a light banana taste, one bean curd?)  all were pleasant with different fresh flavors.  I asked the woman (owners wife) if it would be too much if I ordered the Japchae and a Bibimbap.  She said lots of food.  I ordered it anyway.  It came out and smaller portions than other Korean restaurants I've been to but had excellent taste and presentation.  I'd definitely go back!  Very reasonably priced!\n",

My only criticism is that the place is a bit small so it can't accommodate large groups, and for a fun activity like Korean BBQ (where you cook the meat yourself), you want to go in large groups.\n"

We ordered 5 different menu items, 4 of them being popular Korean dishes, and none of them were made properly. The jjangmyeon and kampoongee flavors were off. The jjangjangmyeon tasted like it was made from the instant packages, and the kampoongee tasted heavily like fish. In addition, the jampong had an excessive amount of red pepper flakes. Although this dish may not be Korean, the agedashi had TOO much batter. There was more batter than actual tofu. That's my mistake for getting that at a Korean restaurant. \n",

      "\n",
      "- [No.6] Noodles with Blackbean sauce & beef dumplings: Small bowl of noodles for 1 person and 6 beef dumplings (if I remember correctly). I'm not a fan of the beef dumplings as I find the stuffing a bit tough for my liking. \n",
      "\n",
      "- [No.56] Fried Rice with Beef & Kimchi: Served in a hot stone pot perfect for chilly weather. I'm not sure if others have had the same experience, but when I had it the rice was overdone - a couple of burnt pieces making it real crunchy (I mean, if you like some texture in your rice, I suppose this does it...). I believe this was supposed to be spicy as well, but I didn't find it spicy at all especially when I'm sensitive to spices. So, if you want this spicy ask them to spice it up! \n",
      "\n",
      "- Side Dishes: They have 4 side dishes usually pickled cucumbers, kimchi, caramelized potatoes, spicy radish/pickled radish or fish cakes. \n",
      "\n",

The female toilet and sink for the female washroom was to close together, and the ceiling for the male washroom was very low. Just a note that this restaurant doesn't take Credit.

The cow died in vain.\n",

I also ordered their special which is the black bean noodles with a side of sweet and sour pork. I ordered it because their was a sign in their restaurant saying it's their specialty. I was so wrong. The noodles are spaghetti and the black bean sauce was not spicy and did not taste like black bean. I do not know what they used but it was not tasty. The sweet and sour pork looked really good on the wall. I thought it would look and taste very similar to the Chinese version of Sweet and Sour pork but as you can see from my picture it looked very interesting. They served the pork separately and you had to dip it into the Sweet and sour sauce. There was more batter than pork. My husband ordered the tofu soup and wasn't too amazed by it.\n",

We stood for a couple minutes admiring the decor before a server noticed us and went to find the hostess. We were promptly seated once she arrived and our server got to us right away.

The sauce for the dumplings is delicious and they were perfectly seared. Next we ordered Vegan Fresh Rolls add shrimp, Salmon Tacos and the Wagyu Burger. The Vegan Fresh Roll is basically a summer roll with a peanut dipping sauce. It was very good. The Wagyu burger is insanely delicious. I did not expect a burger in a Thai restaurant to be so good. It featured smoked gouda, bibb lettuce, pickled onions and a gochujang mayo. The bun on the burger was perfect and it all came together and melted in my mouth.

Was glad to come for a work event because it allowed me to try several things. I recommend the whole menu now :) Seriously I have not had a bad item on the menu. My favorite is the green curry and rice but the bulgogi rice bowl is good as well.  For lunch I noticed they have some good specials. Nice blend of Asian culture to be found in the food here.  I recommend checking out the rooftop area because who doesn't like a nice rooftop. Decent amount of space and a good spot to have a Sapporo rice beer or Suntory Harmony Japanese whisky.

Spice is technically still in their soft opening/getting the hang of things mode, and their grand opening is going to happen in May 2019. Knowing that (and reading some of the other reviews), we set our expectations pretty low but were pleasantly surprised.\n",

The bar was really pretty, and I sooo appreciated seeing purse hooks AND USB/outlets for phone charging. \n",

He thought it was great. \n",

He wanted to get a bourbon since Spice's selection was pretty impressive, but the bartender wouldn't sell him the ones they wanted because they were part of the owner's selection and just for show. Bad move. Don't display multiple bottles of alcohol you're not willing to sell just to look fancy.\n",

We were offered the $15 fried rice for our 2 year old (not happening!). You have rice, noodles, chicken, veggies, etc for your other dishes so it would be very easy to offer a small bowl for kids for $6/$7.\n",

The dumplings were perfectly pan fried, the green curry mussels were super flavorful, the wings were AMAZING, and the tom kha soup was delicious! For dinner we shared the fried rice, bulgogi and kaw pow. Everything was perfect!

The issues began with our appetizers which didn't arrive until AFTER the entrees. We sat waiting for half an hour for the appetizers... nothing. No sign of our very young very inexperienced wait person during that whole time. When the petizers arrived after we had started our entree we sent them back. Then the waitress reappeared and gave a Shakespearean monologue of exaggerated remorse. Th girl would not stop apologizing although we were obviously trying to eat. A disaster. I would not go back -- there are plenty of restaurants out there... but\n",

My husband and I dined in on a Friday night and made the mistake of bringing our two year old; they have no kids menu. We shared the dumplings appetizer and the Tom Kha coconut soup, for entrees we did a pad Thai and another rice bowl can't remember which. The Tom kha soup was delicious!! Some of the best I've had in the area. We didn't get any alcoholic beverages and our bill was around $75! Even when dining in a comparable restaurant to this in South End, without drinks I would never expect to pay that much for food that is inwith decent Thai/Chinese/Vietnamese takeout. For the fort mill area, these prices are over the top. Also wish their menu had a little more variety, somewhat limited options.\n",

To be clear, we were well aware that yours was not a traditional Chinese restaurant, as evident by the tacos, chicken sandwich and burger selections offered on the small one-sided food menu.  Also, we were certainly not looking for enough food to serve an Army, but rather enough to satisfy the average appetite.

On the Sunday I visited it was bare, a few patrons at the bar. After being sat and viewing the menu, I had sticker shock. I have a fast rule, if you visiting an international restaurant that serves another cultures food, the culture should be present in the restaurant. It wasn't. Moreover service was nice but a little in the really slow side. My Appetizer took 25 minutes to come to the table And immediately after my main serving was served. The place is a nice concept in a nice location but I think it's kind of gimmicky. Be ready for atomical pricing.\n",

      "For my entree I went with the Pad See Yew. It was ok, but not worth the $16 price tag. Flavor was a little on the sweeter side, which I'm not a fan of, and the chicken was used sparingly. I also had two glasses of Prosecco with my meal and, with tip, I was over $55 for just me. I expected an upper $30 price tag, but for over $50, I could have had a much better meal elsewhere. \n",

      "578 I consider myself a pad Thai connoisseur, and it's a go-to for me to cook, but this version was not traditional and didn't hit the variety of notes: sweet, spicy, and sour that I expect. Instead, it was only sweet, and asking for spice (ironically) only left me with siracha to add.  I had the gyoza as well, which were fine, if you like sesame, but were under-seasoned, and again, lacked spice. I won't return but get that it has that vibe and has offerings that aren't found in the Fort Mill area.\n",

I'm giving 3 stars because the appetizers were great but our mains were just okay. We shared the tuna crispy bites, KFC wings and dumplings. The wings were the best part of our meal, hands down. Definitely order those! We ordered a couple of drinks; my blackberry cocktail was delicious. The Collins cucumber/strawberry smash could've been better. Seems like the menu consists of raw tuna, raw salmon, bulgogi beef and pulled pork in different iterations. The tacos were not very flavorful; I wouldn't recommend those. Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back just for the KFC wings alone.\n",

To wait 40 minutes for your lunch only to be greated by 95%noodles is a huge turnoff. On top of that we never got any water refills . With this being a new restaurant it would've been useful for the owner or management staff to walk around and greet the guest , maybe then the long waits for service and food could've been addressed proactively. \n",

I thought that was good service, but not enough to make me want to come back and try another dish. From what I viewed from the menu , the prices are too steep for the quantity and quality . I would only venture here again for a drink .\n"

      "So my colleague and I must have been hungry.  We decided to choose two appetizers.   The Roti Canai and the dumplings.  The Roti Canai was okay.  I've had many types and home made Roti Canai from Malaysian to Indian restaurants.  It usually has a slight crisp but ours was a big soggy.  The Roti Canai is accompany with curry sauce and to me it was not thick enough.   The thickness of the curry sauce is really needed in order to eat the Roti Canai.  Typically, I'm use to receiving a piece of Chicken and potato or vegetable in the curry sauce.  Barely anything with the curry sauce.  The Szechuan dumplings were amazing with a slight kick with the chili oil.  Definitely a recommend to try both appetizers when you get a chance to visit.\n",

      "For the main course I opted for the Bibimbap.  A bibimbap is a hot stone bowl filled with amazing vegetable medley, bulgolgi and fried eggs.  Comes with a small bamboo for you to mix all that goodness in the stone bowl all together.  Each bite should have a little everything to create a umami taste that will explode in your mouth with every bite.  Now if you let the rice sit a bit longer on the bottom - it gets pretty crispy like chips.  Now if you like some heat with your bibimbap, it come with kimchi and gochujang sauce.  YUMMY!!!  My colleague decided to order the Seared Ahi Salad which looked amazing!  She finished her plate clean!\n",

I also ordered the dumplings, which weren't my favorite but weren't bad. Next up was the salmon taco, now notice I said TACO. It caught me a little off guard that it was only one singular taco. However, it was delicious and the $4 price tag should have been a clue there would be only one (but I hail from TX where a $1 taco isn't rare lol). To wash this all down I had their Berry Mint Soda.

The larger question we discussed was should ethnic restaurants honour their culture when it comes to customer service or should they reach to be more consistent with their customer base?

I found the prices to be steep looking at the KBBQ menu...$91 /4ppl KBBQ? or $16 for seafood pancake?!  Dolsot Bibimbap was a small portion.   Sides were still ok though. Kalbi was ok too.  What irked me is when I asked for recommendations on the menu (asking what's popular for lunch), they directed me to the KBBQ... But no one in the restaurant (which was full of Koreans) were eating KBBQ...   :(    $70 for lunch, I'd rather go elsewhere.\n"

Swirl all the ingredients together and add some of their red pepper paste (which is really thick) and you've got yourself a hearty and scrumptious meal! Between my husband and I, we both agreed that the best part is the rice that cooked to the bottom of the hot pot...crunchy!

She stirred my pot (no pun intended) and suggested how to eat it and what not. Very nice.\n",

I HATE IT when a restaurant serves me unfiltered water. It's disgusting and unclean and it can ruin your meal. I only took a sip and thought about sending it back. But figured the girl had been nice enough and the food was good enough that I could do without.\n"

BIG BIG fan of this place and I would recommend them to everyone! Only down side  is that they don't delivery but the food is so good it is worth actually putting on pants for! Price is not too bad..dinner for 2 was about $27.

The inside could use a little renovating as well as putting the AC on. When we got inside it was quiet and lacked decor. The Korean food here is good, even tho the actual restaurant is deceiving. I must say the bibimbap is better than any other I have tried in the Charlotte area. The bulgogi on the other hand, was good, just average. \n",

In order to make it the Korean owners serve a variety of American fast food in addition to the full Korean menu.

      "I was pleased with everything we ordered including the delicious Korean seafood and scallion pancake, the noodle dish japchae, the BBQ pork and the bi bimbap, a personal favorite. One disappointment was that the selection of banchan or panchan - tiny dishes, often pickled served with the meal - was limited to just 2: tasty kimchi and pickled radish. At other places (of course I'm comparing to Atlanta) you get at least 4-5 different options or possibly more. Still, I can't complain since the main dishes and the banchan we were given were delicious and definitely hit the spot and satisfied my craving for Korean food. I look forward to returning to China Wing and to visiting the other Korean restaurants in the area. I also look forward to visiting my favorite Korean spots back in Atlanta when we visit!

I never paid it much mind before, but I prefer it this way. I suppose it's just lightly tossed as opposed to saturated with grease, but the flavor did not suffer one bit.

In Korea, Chinese restaurants are very popular and abundant but they put a Korean twist on the food they make causing it to turn into almost a fusion type cuisine such as jajangmyun which Koreans would consider chinese food but is very distinctly Korean in nature. I guess the proprietors here kept with their Korean roots and opened up a fairly Korean Chinese place. The more you know!\n",

      "South Charlotte, off of Arrowwood. Definitely used to be a fast food restaurant at some point -- the remnants of the drive thru menu are still there. \n",
      "\n",
      "AMBIANCE\n",
      "Dark, quiet... There were maybe 4 people in the restaurant when we went. I think more people go there for take-out rather than dining in. There are a ton of seats, with some leather booths interspersed within. \n",
      "\n",
      "FOOD\n",
      "We had the dolsot bibimbap and the seafood soondubu. The Korean food was decent for Charlotte.. don't expect it to compare to Atlanta. It's enough to tie you over until you have time to make your way to Duluth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dolsot Bibimbap\n",
      "This is your typical dolsot bibimbap.. but for some reason, something felt off. Maybe it was the lettuce or the danmooji (pickled daikon) or the tomatoes that were chopped... or maybe it was that the gochujang sauce was too sweet for my taste... It definitely was enough to hold me over until I get to Atlanta but not my favorite. The beef that they added into the dish was delicious though - I have to admit. It was marinated in some sort of bulgogi (sweet teriyaki) sauce and was very very tender. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Seafood Soondubu\n",
      "Soondubu, for those who don't know, is a soft tofu soup. It's typically made with a beef broth with super mushy tofu, and topped with green onions and a raw egg that cooks in the broth. The soondubu at China Wing was okay. It doesn't taste quite like mainstream soondubu but it felt very homemade (in a good way-- like how mom would make it). You definitely have to eat it while it's hot because the tofu burned at the bottom by the end. The dish had a heavy helping of seafood mix including shrimp and squid. The broth was mild and light but very eggy (which is not quite what you would expect). Great for cold weather though.\n",

      "668 Great place to get some awesome Korean and Chinese food. I think the name China Wing is simply for familiarity of Chinese cuisine among the community in the South. But they have some great tasting Korean food. Highly recommended! Very welcome staffs. Probably the best place for Korean food in town!\n",

      "671 Will come out of the gate by saying the food and service is outstanding. The menu has an extremely wide variety of items but make no mistake about it, this is a Korean restaurant first and foremost, but given the surrounding neighborhood i understand why they have other non Korean items to appeal to the varied tastes. But that in itself speaks volumes as they can make a traditional Korean dish and at the same time a Greek Gyro sandwich, both of which are top shelf. Have eaten in only, never take out and will say that the interior is nothing fancy, but it is very clean. It is family owned so they take a great deal of pride in their place and their product and the young lady behind the counter, and waiting tables, and busing them is just a doll and a sweet person. And she is as fluent with her Spanish as she is with her english and Korean. Rare to find someone like her, always happy and smiling and working hard 6 to 7 days a week. We heard about this through the Food Network when they praised their Korean Style Wings. Agreed, these are awesome, but so are the many other Korean dishes we have tried. Top shelf, and if you like to eat Korean, GO HERE!\n"

      "684 I stopped at Choi's China Wing after an extra long work day.  I was tired and didn't want to cook. If I had to describe China Wing I'd say it's the Sybil of restaurants.  Not that that's a bad thing.  They have wings, burgers, Philly cheese steaks, gyros, fried fish, Chinese and Korean on  their menu.  The restaurant was clean, well maintained and inviting.  The prices were reasonable compared to other places. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken along with and order fo 5 hot wings.  It was late and there was only one couple in the place.  It took a little longer to get my order than usually takes at other Chinese take out places, but it couldn't have been more than 5 minutes or so.  I got my food and headed home.  The Kung Pao wasn't quite what I've had at other places.  I haven't had much Korean food, but it tasted like a little Korean style flavoring was added in. But again that is not a bad thing, it was still very good.  The hot wings were a little on the small side I thought, but very flavorful and well cooked.  They were only $3.95 for an order of five wings.  Overall I'd recommend China Wing if you are looking to grab a bite to eat but can't decide what you want.  I'm gonna stop back some time and try some of the other options on the menu.\n",

My only complaint is the long wait time, but I guess that's the price you pay when your food is made fresh.\n",

It's truly unassuming and even the name is a bit un-fitting. It brings to mind those China Ones and China Kings and other generically named Chinese take-outs that are a staple in every Food Lion shopping center across the south east. China Wing, despite the name, is almost anything but.\n",

This daughter of the owners actually took our orders and served us our food. Her and her parents are actually Korean, not Chinese. To be fair, one of the neon signs outside does say they do Korean food too. If you ask me I'd say they should change the name to Korea Wing simply because they seem to do that best. I also find it more unique.\n",

      "I ordered a bowl of bibimbap. Easily my favorite Korean dish I haven't had it in years. It was just as good as I remember. An assortment of veggies, beef, rice and an over-easy egg in a searing hot bowl. When you get it you let it sizzle a bit to crisp the rice in the bottom. Then you stir it up and have at it. If you fear the spiciness of Korean food this is one sure-fire way to avoid it. Their menu is basically divided with Chinese food on one side and Korean on the opposite. An interesting fusion item I'd like to try here some day is the bulgogi cheesesteak. The cheesebulgogi in a word.\n",

      "726 A hidden gem for authentic Korean cuisine. At first, I was not impressed when a Korean friend told me about this place. But really, the outside facade doesn't do justice to the food served here and the super friendly owner. Previously called China Wings and for years it was quite popular for their wings (duh!) but I never thought this place can serve authentic Korean dish due to the other varieties of their asian menu. Honestly, I was wrong. After they changed their name to Choi's Korean and I went there twice to focus only on their Korean dishes, I am convinced their Korean food is not only refreshing but also very authentic. They serve among the best authentic Korean in the Southeast. The food is great with a long list varieties of Korean dishes. And the owners (an older Korean couple and their son) are super friendly and clearly take pride of the food they serve. This is a must go place if you are craving for an authentic and fresh Korean in the area. But please, don't get turn off with the looks of the building and the location. Believe me, you will NOT be disappointed.\n"

I looked on the Yelp reviews and found this place and it seem to have above average ratings. So I decided to give it a try. The young lady at the cash register was very friendly and gave me recommendations. I ordered a mix of the fried wings and fried shrimp with the vegetable rice. Honestly, the best thing was the vegetable rice. The wings were those little tiny drumettes And they were dry and tough to chew. I ordered them honey barbecue style and they just literally poured a little bit of honey barbecue sauce on them. It wasn't soaked in the sauce so therefore it didn't permeate through to the meat. The fried shrimp honestly look like they came out of the frozen box of shrimp you get at the grocery store. The vegetable rice was good and flavorful. I don't live on this side of town so it's highly unlikely that I will stop in this place again but if I were on the side of town again I'd skip it.\n",

The dumplings were crisp and light and okay. There's other apps I want to try more. The bulgogi was so flavorful and delicious. First off it comes out on a sizzling plate and you get all the sides with it. I wasn't sure what everything was, but the only piece I could have done without was the bean sprouts. I even liked the Kimchi, which I'm discovering I do like when it's fresh. Back to the bulgogi, the meat was tender and I liked it was cooked with thinly sliced vegetables. Sometimes the sauce on bulgogi can lean on the sweet side, but this one had a nice balance of savory and sweet. I couldn't eat everything and was happy to have leftovers. \n",

I squirted on gochujang and some mayo that's brought out in these massive squeeze bottles, not just a tiny ramekin of either, and once it was edibly cooled off- I loved it. LOVED it.

It has become my comfort food of choice. And the stone bowl bi bim bap is amazing. Try the barley tea... And now they take debit so it's even more convenient. They will also package up your food for takeout if you have to eat at your desk.\n",

      "We ordered an orginal bibimbap, chicken bibimbap, and tonkatsu. The bibimbap dishes were good, but it wasn't worth it. The bibimbap dishes also came with miso soup, which was very plain and 2 side dishes. Again, it's nothing special and there weren't enough side dishes that came with them. The tonkatsu was very disappointing. They gave you rice, cabbage salad(some of the cabbage was turning black) and heated up frozen veggies that you could buy in any grocery store.\n",

      "777 I remember bookmarking this place when I was having a craving for Korean BBQ. This happens to be the closest one to my house and right up the street from the College of Southern Nevada. This place is like traditional Korean BBQ but the food is already cooked for you. I came here and I've passed it so many times without realizing that this place even existed. It's right next to the new car wash on Charleston. I would describe this building like a mall food court but without the mall. Now it is family owned and there is a language barrier but still understandable. The cashier saw me staring at the menu for awhile she explained to me that spicy chicken wasn't really that spicy. But I was feeling like spicy chicken and she said if I wanted she could make it a little spicier for me. If you present your student ID they do give you a discount by offering you a free soda. I've come back three times since my initial visit and they seem to recognize a familiar face. Especially because they're not that busy and they have a lot of competition within the food court. The most expensive thing on the menu was $15 for beef short ribs. The food comes served in a nice plastic tupperware with different sections. It comes with rice, cabbage salad with mayo dressing and a yellow vegetable? I also asked for ALOT of kimchi and they were so sweet to provide extra. They have metal chopsticks but you can ask for a fork if needed.\n"

Favorite dishes so far include the octopus poke with spicy mayo and japchae (translucent sweet potato noodles with veggies).  The bulgogi (Korean BBQ beef) is a must-try.  The soju cocktail with watermelon is delicious as well.  During my next visit, I may try one of the chicken offerings.  They look scrumptious.\n",

This Korean dishes served here come  pretty close to the food my mom, who immigrated from South Korea, makes. I enjoyed the kimbap, mandu, kimchi fried rice, and bulgogi.  I have also had the chicken katsu which I know is not Korean(it doesn't take a genius to know that) and it was excellent, tender inside and crispy outside. I thought the decor was nice and pleasant but honestly, who cares about how a place looks as long as it is clean and if the food is good.

He sent out dessert to share, which was a Japanese style cream covered light as air 'jiggle' cheesecake which was awesome.  Overall a good experience.

We don't usually eat much Korean food so we weren't familiar with the entrees. Our friends recommended the Salmon teriyaki which was cooked perfectly with a sweet teriyaki sauce that complemented the sticky rice nicely. I like noodles so I got Japchae sweet potato noodles with beef. I loved the smooth texture of the noodles, similar to rice noodles, and the tenderly cook beef pieces. Portion sizes are appropriate not too much or little. Ambiance was very relaxing, will be even better in the summer time with their front glass wall opened to the sidewalk. We'll be coming back more for sure this summer.\n",

For my second visit, I even brought my Korean mom here and we had a fun night drinking soju and eating the kimchi pajeon and nori fries. This isn't where I would go when I miss my mom's cooking (for that, I hit up Korea Garden in Oakland) but I would come back here for a date night with my husband.\n"

The bibimbap was pretty tasty, though I was disappointed that it wasn't served in a hot stone bowl - which is something I really love. So, I didn't get to cook the egg yolk with the rice, stir it all around with a spoon (uh, there were no spoons at the table?) and eat it with a spoon (which, my understanding, is the traditional utensil for this dish). \n",

I had the Bulleit Bourbon, Bulleit Rye, Plum, Honey, Basil cocktail, served up in a coupe glass, very tasty!  Other 2 friends enjoyed some beers. Pork Mandu app was very tasty! But somehow our dinner order got lost, so there was a delay, but the waitress made up for it with a round of drinks on the house, very nice. 3 of us got the Korean BBQ Combo, a mix of Kalbi, Bulgogi, and Dwaejibulgogi. I was tempted by the Octopus Poke, but the smell of the grilled meat platter from our neighbors was too intoxicating not to try! I'm not a big kimchi fan, but their version is not too bad, and along with the pickled cucumbers come with the dish (banchan) as traditional, so I did eat it and wonderfully complimented the meat and rice.  Friend 2 got the Tuna Poke and declared it delish. The chef came out & said hello to check on us, & we all agreed the dinners were a success. He said the Octopus Poke is not a big seller so they may discontinue it, so i'll have to get back soon to try it.  Other than the delay/snafu, the only drawbacks were the room was kind of cold ( it was a cool evening but the air was on full blast ) , and the music was kind of loud. The waitress even asked us to repeat our drink & food selections as it was so loud. And loud from the crowd chatter too, as it was busy, so maybe turn the music down & add some sound dampening devices, (or even some art?!) on the walls... But all in all a welcome addition to our neighborhood, we'll be back !\n",

      "813 Went here a few weeks ago and was very impressed. We sat at the bar. The staff was like a fine oiled machine in that I was never quite sure who my server was because they were all smooth in the transition of service. The food was delicious and flavorful. We ordered the Gimbap and were surprised at how fresh it was, we forgot to ask for yum yum/ spicy mayo sauce because it didn't need it. We got the Nori fries,  because I've an unhealthy obsession with fries, and enjoyed the take on it with the nori. My companion ordered the kalbi and i got the Korean bbq combination. My goodness was it all good! The mixture of flavors and seasonings was well balanced. My companion got the soju plum which he liked. We tried the 3 soju infused in lavender, espresso, and pepper and fairly enjoyed their uniqueness. I had the soju punch and loved its fruity/ sweet flavor. Looking forward to going back tonight!\n",

The ownership is the chef and he came out to introduce himself and thank us for coming.  Waitress service was generally good, but took a long time to get our check after we asked for it. Would comeback again for more.\n",

We don't have much experience with Korean food so we tried to get a little bit of everything and both of us loved it all. I got the Korean BBQ combination and my wife ordered the pineapple salmon. We also got the mandu (pork and kimchi) and the chicken Katsu. I would highly recommend it all, my wife especially liked the sauce that came with the katsu.  I also ordered the Soju punch and it was a nice, fruity drink.  Simon, the head chef, came around to check on us... he's the man! We will definitely be back (many times)! It's worth the 40 minute drive for us.\n",

      "Despite the fact that the restaurant is listed as a restaurant, a label as bar may suit it better, because the menu is extremely limited. Besides, the food cannot even be called Korean fusion. It is purely a deviation of Korean based on misunderstanding. \n",

      "I ordered the kimchi fried rice and BBQ chicken. The fried rice is way too sour, as many other reviewers have stated, and you know that the kimchi is the problem. BBQ chicken is average, or let's put it this way, you can grill it yourself without any efforts. \n",

The restaurant space is nice though a little small and loud. While we waited for our table we had some drinks ordered at the bar and caught the tail end of happy hour. The service was very good. Despite having a large group, our waiter was totally on top of things. They have plenty of great draft options as well as cocktails. We ordered lots of appetizers. Just about everything I tried was excellent including the Mandu, Chicken Katsu, Nori French Fries and Poutine. I had the BBQ Chicken which was fantastic, loved their BBQ sauce. I also tried the Poke which was great, lots of flavors. Just before we were ready our checks, our waiter came over and told us he wanted to do a shot with us which was a very unexpected surprise. This place is super affordable. Definitely check this out.\n"

It is essentially fried dumplings. The dipping sauce is sour and spicy/sweet, but the filling were a little bit dry. For entry, we got BBQ combo, 8.5/10, it came with 3 kinds of bbq, kabi ribs, bogogi and grilled pork. I like the beef better than the pork. The pork turned out a little dry but the beef were very juicy, tender and flavorful. Also the BBQ combo comes with two small side plates, it includes kimchi, radish and pickled cucumber. \n",

We don't have a lot of restaurants here for just that, but this one seems to have some good dishes in that style.  The Bi Bim Bap(I just like saying the name) was good and the katsu curry.  Although the Katsu tastes like a regular yellow curry dish, which still begs the question, what distinguishes Korean food from other Asian foods?  Anyways, the servers are super nice and accomodating, the food comes at a incredibly fast clip and tastes good.  Also, they have a nice set of decent craft beers available on draft, bottles, or cans.\n",

We will definitely be back! The bartender was really nice too! They have happy hour Tuesday-Friday 1/2 off draft beers and money off the Soju. Soju is a Korean alcohol, similar to saki.

It was a healthy portion and I was barely able to finish it after the appetizers.  My boyfriend got the Bibimbap, which was also a winner.  Again, the dish was sizable and the beef was dressed really nicely.   \n",

The interior is pleasant with very friendly and attentive wait staff! The food was delivered quickly and was extremely fresh. Their fried tofu.... way too hot to eat at first (this is a good thing, trust me). For taste and authenticity, it was a great as was the Tteokbokki. Regarding portion sizes, Soju offers decently large dishes at very fair prices. While their hours indicate that they are a brunch or dinner joint, they do have happy hour deals as well. The alcohol selection can be on the pricier end, but I definitely recommend dining here at least once! I had a great time, and I hope to be back!\n",

      "843 I was excited to try this place as there are few Koreans options in Pittsburgh and I love Korean food.  I was expecting it to be a bit more Americanized from what I had read; however, I was still disappointed.  The interior looks like a typical hipster sort of place with a nice looking bar and communal seating. There are a variety of sojus on the drink menu which was nice.  However, while the food seemed to be generally prepared well and used high quality ingredients, everything I ordered was cloyingly sweet, which really detracted from the experience.  This included the katsu dipping sauce, the kimbap sushi (because of the bulgogi marinade), and the mixed BBQ entree. It reminded me of Chinese restaurants that are overly Americanized where all the sauces are sickeningly sweet. I'll still give it 3 stars as there were some people who like that sort of Americanized asian cuisine with the sweet sauces, but it is not authentic tasting and did not suit my particular tastes well. The pervasiveness of the sweet marinades and sauces ended up making everything taste the same, which was too bad as I could tell the meat was tender, cooked perfectly, and of a nice quality, so I would have liked to taste the actual meat better.  Another major disappointment was the banchan, which for me is the highlight of going to a Korean restaurant, and the range and quality of the banchan is a sign for me of how good a Korean restaurant is. However, only select dishes came with banchan, which only included 2 banchan items (pickled cucumbers and pickled radish), and everyone on the table gets duplicates of the same banchan. I wouldn't really classify this as a Korean restaurant, but more of an asian-fusion restaurant as everything is so Americanized, and there are other asian dishes on the menu that aren't Korean, such as Japanese (katsu) and Hawaiian (poke). This place also appears to be run entirely by Caucasians as there wasn't an actual Asian person in sight, although I couldn't see the kitchen area. The clientele was also 90% Caucasian, which is telling, as all the best Asian restaurants in town have a much higher percentage of Asian diners who know where to find the real high quality authentic places. The prices are also quite high for the amount of food you get, although the service was prompt and attentive.\n",

However, the drinks menu was more extensive. It was very nice of the owner/head-chef to greet us and thank us for coming out. Overall service was great and presentation was nice~\n",

      "Soju Punch: \n",
      "A mix between soju, yakuroto yogurt, and tropical fruits. This tasted really good! Taste like an alcoholic version of Yakult/Calpico.\n",

      "Korean BBQ Combination:\n",
      "If you're like me and loves to try everything, get this! You get all the three meats they offer: Kalbi, bulging, and dwaejibulgogi. It comes with white rice and two banchans, kimchi and pickled cucumbers. You get three decently sized pieces of each meat: The meats were cooked and seasoned well. The sauces were on the sweet side. I liked it, but for $18, I expected a bit more stuff. The banchan included pickled cucumbers and kimchi. The pickled cucumbers was sooo good, just the right amount of sourness and sweetness. The kimchi however, was more sour than spicy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kimchi fried rice with egg:\n",
      "The egg was perfectly cooked over easy. The fried rice was seasoned well, but it was not that spicy. The kimchi was more sour than spicy. As someone who loves sour food, I still thought it was sour. Maybe it would've been more enjoyable if it was a bit more spicy and a bit less sour. \n",
      "\n",
      "VERDICT:\n",

      "Would I order them again? I would order the drink and the meat again, but not the fried rice.\n",

      "\n",
      "It's a single-page menu, but it features enough choices that picking what I wanted was difficult. The menu also had the added bonus of featuring pronunciations for all the dishes I've been mispronouncing for oh so many years. There's also an extensive alcohol list with unique cocktails and a handful of choices of Soju, the drink that serves as the restaurant's namesake (I recommend it).\n",

      "The service was great and made for a wonderful experience overall. I chose the Korean BBQ combination and it seemed to be the perfect portion when combined with half an appetizer (the tteokbokki is something I highly recommend). It's a place that I will surely stop back to someday.\n",

      "854 Good Korean food in Pittsburgh?  On Penn Ave?  All my skepticism was tossed aside after the first few bites at Soju.  We had a large party, so we basically got to try a little of everything.  The Gimbap was tasty, with sweet rice and marinated beef balancing the crunchy daikon and subtle flavor of the Nori.  The Kimchijeon was smooth with just the right proportions of ingredients (meaning, no huge chunks of seafood popping out of the filling).  But the best appetizer was the Tteokbokki - the tenderest rice cakes dipped in a sweet-spice sauce, I had no shame in finishing off that plate and asking for another.  The Galbi and Bulgogi were seasoned just right and disappeared quickly, and the Salmon and ChickenKatsu were both cooked perfectly, with a nice addition of grilled beets and zucchini to balance the flavors.  And remember to save some room for their cheesecake -- not exactly traditional Korean fare, but when you taste it, you won't care.  I'm definitely going back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fair warning, there will be a line when you show up - we arrived exactly at 5pm when they opened, and we were seated quickly, but by the time we were done, there was a line out the door, in the rain.  But be patient -- this food is definitely worth waiting for.\n",

I will caveat this review with neither us like sweet food or cocktails - so this is likely personal preference. That said most everything was very sweet. We started with 2 orders of dumplings (Mandu) and had Bulgogi and BiBimBap for entrees. The dumplings were ok, not great, same with the BiBimBap. The Bulgogi was very raw and overly sweet. I love Korean food and have had it many times but unfortunately SoJu missed the mark for me.\n",

The stir fried rice cakes were personally my favorite, because I loved the texture of the rice cakes and the sauce they were in. It was spicy, thick, and bursting with flavor. My second favorite was a tie between the tofu or the pancake. The tofu was crispy but soft, and the sauce again was excellent. The pancake is yummy and a great way to soak up that extra delicious sauce. The gimbap was good too. \n",
      "\n",
      "For my main course, I had the bimbimbap with beef. The bimbimbap was outstanding and the beef had a sweet flavor and was cooked perfectly- it wasn't tough or dry. I loved how they put lots of veggies in the bimbimbap that went together with the sauce. I loved the pickles in the bowl! The rice was also soft and sticky...mmm. If you go to Soju, just remember that you can't go wrong with the bimbimbap! In addition to my love for Soju's bimbimbap, my dad raved about his chicken katsu- he said that he could just order a giant plate of it and just eat that and be happy. \n",

They do not take reservations and the place was packed when I arrived at around 7pm on a Saturday. We only had to wait 15 minutes or so but the vibe was lively throughout our meal. Younger crowd and kind of wonky decor (pictures of large partially naked people, lots of exposed brick) all add to that feel. Service was casual and friendly.\n",

      "Food is very solid. My girlfriend and I split two appetizers. The kimchi pancake was pretty standard for Korean places, but very crispy (vs. soft). It came with a very zesty dipping sauce. The Korean poutine was basically a large bowl of thick fries in a curry gravy. There were some tofu pieces that were supposed to substitute for cheese curds but didn't add much. Not sure what was Korean about this but it was tasty. We also got the bibimbap bowl which was our favorite! Plentiful mix of veggies, rice, and bulgogi beef with the spicy red sauce. So all in all the food is typical Korean but quite good.\n",

      "The first impressions of this store were promising - the decor was contemporary and waitresses friendly. However, we were given A4 paper menus with a limited selection of choices. I ordered the bibimbap for 18 dollars (it was 14 dollars + 4 dollars for beef which I thought was absurd and reflects a poor pricing strategy). The food itself was pretty good, I would argue a little too sweet but given the target audience it makes sense, but absolutely not worth the price of nearly 20 dollars. The bibimbap also comes with no side dishes, a necessary practice in Korean cuisine.\n",

The Kimchijeon (kimchi pancake) was perfectly fried, crisp, and delicious and, again, the sauce that came with it was the perfect accompaniment. For the main course, we split the Korean BBQ sample, mostly because my indecisive self can never pick just one thing. All three - the kalbi, bulgogi, and dwaejibulgogi - were phenomenal. Tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. I would recommend any of them individually, but the combo is a great chance to try all three.\n",

The place was very brightly lit providing a welcoming ambience. We started with the scallop pancake and the rice cakes. The pancake was a little dark for our liking,  but it tasted good. The rice cakes were disappointing. They were just pieces of starch in some spicy sweet sauce, but after the first one or two pieces, it got very boring. There needed to be something else to provide a textural contrast. We didn't finish this dish. For mains, we had the mixed grilled meats and the kimchi fried rice. The mixed grill came with a side of ban chan. The meat was very soft and well seasoned, while the kimchi fried rice was tasty, but a little too oily. Service was ok throughout, but servers did seem a little cold at times. They had some really cool cocktails that might be worth a try. Overall, decent experience, but we probably won't be running back to eat there again. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.\n",

All in all, I was totally blown away as this instantly became my fave Korean in town! The lunch deal cost around 10 bucks for a soup, the bibimbap and kimchee, nice ! Good value and good times.

      "891 Decided to forego the AYCE (all you can eat) Mon Ami down the street and try Le K'Bob. From the exterior, it looked promising. Korean fried chicken and bibimbap, what's not to like? The interior has a modern, almost sterile look to it. Not necessarily my flavor, but no complaints. The young man serving us seemed somewhat new at the food service game, but I've been there before so I gave him a pass. We ordered the sweet and spicy fried chicken and the bibimbap. The chicken was solid, had a bit of a cinnamon twang to it, but could've used a little more kick. We used the hot sauce that came with the bibimbap to dip the chicken in, and that made all the difference. Speaking of the bibimbap, it was also pretty solid, maybe could spen more time getting crispy in the clay pot, but otherwise pretty good. Overall i give this place a solid 3 stars, but unfortunately for these folks it'll be hard competing with their neighbors at Mon Ami.\n"

      "892 NDG has possibly the highest concentration of Korean restaurants in Montreal due to a high Korean population in the area. There is a lot of choice here, and some of the local Korean fare is excellent. K'Bob is a new addition to the mix and one may expect that it would be hard to stand out in the area. However, the food is absolutely excellent with some innovative offerings I have not seen elsewhere. The standards are done exceptionally well, and I find that their Korean Fried Chicken has the best combination of crispy outside and juicy inside that I have tried. I think their spicy offerings could be a bit hotter, but that is me. There is currently no liquor license and I really hope that changes.\n",

      "Olive oil fried chicken sort of has a healthy ring to it doesn't it.... This review is mainly for the original fried chicken. i have read that a lot of the other friend chicken with sauce are quite soggy and not very good. Personally the original fried chicken is quite crispy and has a clean flavor to it based on the oil used for frying. This leans to a crisp fried chicken instead of the chunky hard fried chicken you get at other fried fast food restaurants. The only issue is that the fried chicken comes at a cost. it is unbelievably expensive and the chicken pieces are also quite small. With that, it is good for a 1 time experience, but I will take my fried chicken cravings elsewhere. \n",

I had this with some dry waffle fries & a lemonade. My friend's chicken (2 pieces) was a bit better since her chicken was tender.

The chicken is always quality (crisp on the outside, tender on the inside) and sauce is perfect addition. As for the service I think people expect food service workers to always be fake smiling in your face and they don't do that here and that's oki with me.

      "939 This is a tough one for me to review! I spent a summer with my friends in Korea going to a number of Karaokes and in all fairness they weren't always clean or nice. That and $20 for one hour of Karaoke is a great rate. The service is actually pretty decent as well. But there's a vibe to the place that makes this place feel ghetto and trashy. The lack of a front door (and entrance by alley) starts things off on a bad note, and the interior is poorly put together. The rooms themselves felt a little small (although the Karaoke machines were the top of the line). \n",
      "\n",
      "The food of course was way overpriced and I would HIGHLY recommend against trying anything on the menu, unless it's an appetizer meant to be eaten as you drink. Not only is the quality of the food questionable, it is a poor representation of Korean food. \n",

      "At the end of the night, you will have fun with your friends. And even cost wise if you go with a large group and share food and drinks, the bill will be pretty reasonable. But that being said Sole could do a lot better and I am sorry that people might get the impression that Korean Karaokes are all like Sole.\n"

They've got a good variety on their menu and what we ordered was tasty.  We shared the garlic soy wings and they had great flavor.  My japchae lunch which came with my pick of tonkatsu topped with bulgogi gravy was hearty and the japchae was a tad greasy, but was very delicious and hit the spot.  My friend's ribeye bulgogi was a much healthier alternative although a bit bland without hot sauce (which is house made).  Service was really great and courteous - we will be back!\n",

This is their specialty and you definitely won't regret it. According to my friend, this was best-fried chicken he had eaten in his entire life. Ordered the tofu stew (soondubu) and was pleasantly surprised by how flavourful and tasty it was. I've been to my fair share of Korean restaurants in my lifetime and this was definitely one of the tastiest tofu stews I've had in awhile. \n",

      "951 The quest for a good Korean restaurant in Montr챕al has officially come to an end, my friends. THIS is the place to go for some good, solid, home-cooked Korean food, and if the fact that I basically downed all of it in one sitting isn't a clear indication, then brace yourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon walking in, I was greeted with a wait time of approximately 10-15 minutes, which totally was okay with me despite having travelled by metro and bus to get there. Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do to get good food, right? Anyway, it seemed popping with a mostly Asian crowd gorging on KFC (Korean Fried Chicken, that is) and other Korean specialities like soft tofu stew and bibimbap, which is always a good sign. After being seated, I decided to go with the half order of fried chicken, a plate of fried mandu (dumplings), and a kimchi jjigae (pork, kimchi, and tofu stew served with rice). It may seem like a lot, but it was all worth it in the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the fact that they actually give you a decent selection of banchan (things like pickled radish cubes, side salad with thousand island dressing, kimchi and other pickled vegetables), everything clearly seemed to be freshly made in house and comes out piping hot. The kimchi jjigae was served with its contents boiling in the pot, just like it should, and it was perfectly spicy and contained just the right amount of each ingredient. The rice soaked up the broth and made it so much more dimensional that it would have been if eaten plain. The mandu were crisp and contained a nice meat filling, and even though I've had better, it came with 12 of them so I didn't really care because they still tasted good! Finally, the star of the meal came out, and it was - you guessed it - the FRIED CHICKEN. OMG. I think I died and went to heaven upon biting into the super-crispy, twice-fried outer layer and sunk my teeth into juicy meat heaven. It helped a lot too that KFC is mostly served with dark meat instead of white because everyone who knows chicken is aware of the fact that THAT'S where all the flavor is. The batter was also well-seasoned and served as a perfect soggy-proof coating for the chicken. Basically, all of these criteria are what make Korean Fried Chicken the absolute gold standard, especially when compared to its often-soggy, underseasoned American counterpart. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the meal, I was almost completely stuffed but over the moon at the same time. Even though I have to travel 4.5 miles (sorry for the Americanisms, haha) by public transportation to get here, Mon Ami deserves nothing less than a 5-star rating, and I would 100% come back at the next opportunity.\n"

Light, not greasy at all, extra crispy and very high quality pieces of meat.  Spicy pork stir fry was outstanding, nice and spicy, and the steamed dumplings were extremely fresh and delicious.

I can't drink right now but once I can, I can only imagine how amazing and heavenly a box of the garlic crusted fried chicken with a side a beer will be. Their pancakes are so so, but I've only gotten it as takeout and that did not survive the ride home well. Was a bit of a soggy mess when it made it. They have deep fried giblets and stir fried. Deep fried for me is the hands down winner. Crispy and crunchy exterior, soft and chewy interior. All in all, I'll probably never go to kfc again for fried chicken.\n",

When I first try out a restaurant and there's no one when I get there I always prepare for the worst, especially when the restaurant is only a couple of tables with some chairs and doesn't even really look like a restaurant. Still we sat down and took a look at the menu, the waiter came and helped us since there was a lot if Korean items to choose from. There is about 50 items on the menu but we came there for the chicken so that's what we settled for.  We took a the boneless spicy chicken with some rice and it came with pickled raddish and a salad. Now at first the raddish and salad didn't look really good but I still tried them out and let me tell you it was delicious, I ate the whole thing. After a few minutes the chicken came and I have to say this has to be some of the best chicken I ever ate.  It was cut to perfection no nerves or anything nasty in the chicken, the meat was perfectly cooked and super crispy, as for the sauce it was simply amazing, so hot and so sweet at the same time that every bite would leave your mouth burning but you couldn't resist going for another one.

Read some reviews and everyone mentioned fried chicken, so among the dishes we ordered I got the soy garlic sauce fried chicken, and it was perhaps the best chicken I've ever had in my life. Everything else was very good too.\n",

      "After we put in our order, the waiter informed us that kimchi is extra for $1 whereas at the Downtown location, it was complimentary. The food was delicious but not as good as the Downtown one (probably because they have so many more employees so the food comes out faster). Loved the hot stir-fried rice cake - not too spicy, the vegetable dumplings, the kimchi, but the highlight is that friend chicken yum! We got a whole fried chicken shared between 3 and we were in a food coma by the end of it.\n",

We tried Dawa and found it was overpriced and not even in the same league as Mon ami where I discovered delicious food, friendly helpful and efficient service for take out that was ready to go in 15 minutes. I ordered  the 14 pieces of # 1 fried chicken over the phone for a pick up. We will definitely be back to try the dining experience !\n",

I didn't really like my pork and kimchi soup that much, but the chicken was VERY good. Crispy with sweet and garlic sauce was definitely a good choice for me. The price of the dishes are also very good - I think my soup order was $8. That isn't too bad compared to other locations. Their side dishes are slightly more disappointing though - there was a lot of radishes and cucumbers, along with kimchi of course.\n",

I now understand their enthusiasm. I also ordered a dolsot bibimbap and to be honest, had better elsewhere. The seafood pancake was so big and scrumptious and the kimchi ramen was comforting for the tummy!  Hidden in NDG, this place is worth the detour. Be sure to get there soon or make reservations. The place fills up quite fast at around 7:30 pm. Very reasonable prices and the waitresses were very nice. Before leaving the restaurant, i have ordered a big serving of fried chicken for 18,99$+tax and two different types of sauces to take home. Had some for a late night munchies and it was still crispy! Hmmm!!! A very pleasant discovery and i will be back soon\n",

I also had Bibimbap and the amount of beef in it was the most generous out of all the Korean places I've visited in Montreal (Chez Bong, Ganadara, Kantapia, a place near Decarie, and several others, the names of which escape me). The flavoring is really on the spot and the staff is super sweet. At first glance, the prices of some plates (such as the specialties and the fried chicken) look expensive, but then you see the huge portions. Our small order of chicken for $10.99 was actually 7 pieces of medium sized meat. Very generous. Love this place!\n",
