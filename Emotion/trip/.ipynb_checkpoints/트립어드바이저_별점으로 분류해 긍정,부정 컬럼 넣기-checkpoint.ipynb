Don't skip the fried potstickers - DH said they tasted like the ones in Seoul. He had the bibimbop and said it was delicious. As others mentioned, the place is small with kitchy decor. Service and food quality were 100% and top notch. I'm all in on the Korea House! We'll be back!\n",

I have zero experience with Korean food, but I found everything tasty. The side dishes are fun. Prices are moderate and parking plentiful. This is a very casual place. They do take credit cards.\n",

Portions were very appropriate for someone with a large appetite. Rice was sticky and moist without being mushy. There was a bit of wait as it was very crowded; but, I would say it's worth the wait.

They bring out a lot of sides (\"banchan\") to the table for everyone to share, good variety of dishes like kimchi, bean sprouts, potatoes, etc. Staff is always welcoming and friendly. All those awards are well earned.\n",

      "17 Hands down, the most authentic Korean experience I've had back in the states, the food is delicious, and prepared by what appears to be a family. Make sure to eat your fill while you're there because Korean food has the tendency to make itself known in the fridge. I've seen some complaints about service, but they operate just like restaurants in Korea do, you've got to tell them you want something, and it'll be on the table in no time flat. The only downside is that I didn't have the stomach to eat everything on the menu, they basically have all of the classics that you could possibly want. If I lived closer, this would be a weekly spot.\n",

      "18 My wife and I both enjoy Korean food very much but it is very difficult to find in many cities in the South. This restaurant was rated as the best Korean food in the Nashville area so we tried it. I had the KimChee soup with beef and Mary had Bulgogi. We were served the traditional little side dishes with our meal and these are always my way of separating the good from the very best. The kim chee itself was on the rather tame side. I did not request the really dilish hot stuff and am sorry I did not. However, it was very good and the soup was outstanding to the last drop and it was served in a huge bowl which I lifted and drained just like I used to do in Korea! The bulgogi was also very good. The service was friendly and helpful and relatively fast and the prices were reasonable. If you want to try Korean food, this is a very good place to do it with good food and a large selection to choose from. I cannot remember the name of the red \"paste\" they always bring in a side dish which looks like ketchup but I can say that it is what stole the show for me here! I dipped everything I could in it and it was SCRUMPTIOUS!\n",

The iPhone didn't capitalize Korean new year, but did for Chinese New Year, so I guess not. Anyway, back to Korea House. Located in a strip mall along Charlotte Pike, it's a rather small and unassuming restaurant. We had a party of six and were at immediately, but we also arrived at open. I can see where this place would fill up rather quickly because of the small size.\n",

      "As my first time here, and I think my first time at a Korean place, I skimmed the pictures on here and got a couple tips from some friends who'd ate here before. I went with the chicken bulgogi ($14.99). I wasn't sure what it was, but the bulgogi seemed like the popular thing on the menu. It came with a bunch of different sides. We had a table of 6, and they brought out two ordered of sides for the table. The portion for the chicken bulgogi was large, it also came with a container of steamed, white rice. I mixed some of the rice in with the main dish and put a little of the sauce from the bottle onto my plate. It was a little spicy, but not insanely spicy. I enjoyed it and would probably get it again if I went back.\n",

They give you a very large portion along with the sides everyone at my table always leaves with a doggie bag, or a doggie cup if they got soup. :) The only downside is the restaurant is very small and everyone loves the place so if you come during the lunch or dinner rush be prepared to wait in line.\n",

The bulgogi is also very good. The service is average. The value is great. I would have no problem giving them a 5 if the atmosphere was a little nicer and the service a little better.

      "40 Those of us in the Nashville advertising community are a fairly tight knit bunch. Joe and I made a date for lunch and he suggested Korea House on Charlotte. \"Sure thing\" was my reply. When I arrived on the scene Joe was seated and I told him as I sat down that it was my first time, not only at Korea House, but also to try Korean food. His immediate response was that he assumed I'd been there with his cousin, Judy, also an advertising vet and dear buddy of mine. The place was shabby chic. Populated by diners who were largely seemingly Korean. A Korean TV station was on the screens. Followed Joe's lead and ordered the #16. Dolsot Bibimbap - rice topped with vegetables and beef bits and a fried egg in a hot stone pot. When our dishes arrived on he table they were literally sizzling. The waitress with a beautiful smile had brought us small dishes of assorted additions to mix into our stone pots. We mixed and blended. The results were a delicious cacophony of flavors. Have to confess, upon entry I was a bit worried. Glad I followed Joe's lead with #16. Just really great! Going back for sure. Thanks, Joe for introducing me to Korea House! Totally enjoyed! A new Nashville favorite!\n",

Server Jennifer was understanding about our cluelessness re Korean food and kindly made a suggestion to help firm my choice and several others made the same decision. Yummy beef, veggies, rice served in a hot iron pot topped w/egg. The place is small and clean; unencumbered by décor but welcoming to an almost capacity lunch bunch who seemed surprised to see our 10 seated, perhaps in their usual spots. We'll be back.\n",

The food was delicious and hot (both temperature and spice) and you get a lot of it. Some lunch items were served in a steaming stone pot that kept the food cooking throughout the entire meal. The menu is authentic Korean cuisine with nearly 100 options to choose from. However, it’s not somewhere to go if you are looking for a quick business lunch. Lunch lasted about 90 minutes. It’s also not good for large groups (go with a group of 4 or less).\n",

      "46 We have been to Korea House a few times. The food is consistently good and is pretty cheap overall. I order the bimbimbap with beef, which comes with all the classic Korean side accompaniments. It comes out served in a hot stone or clay pot so that the bottom of the rice gets extremely crispy- which makes it absolutely delicious. Another staple we normally get is the beef ribs - they come with scallions and a wonderful sauce on a hot plate. I absolutely love their house made hot sauce - it is like a Korean style Sirachai- sooo good. The only things we haven't been huge fans of were the seafood pancake and the tripe soup. The seafood pancake was almost inedible because it was so fishy tasting. Even with having a few dishes we would never order again, the food is consistently pretty good. Service is ok- its not fine dining or even like a regular restaurant. The set up is a little cramped style but is normally full because its probably the best Korean in Nashville.\n",

Folks standing in line outside should have been our first clue. The service was slow, but the food was oh-so-wonderful. Like beef bulgogi? Bibimbap? Eight sides to share? Fresh ingredients served hot, authentic flavors. Dynamite experience and would like to sample other menu items soon.\n",

The smells emitting from the kitchen are full of spice and flavor before you even taste it.\n",

It was our first time at a Korean restaurant so when we would try to ask questions they were short with us or would just walk away. When the woman brought the sides out we asked what they were and the woman as she was walking away said \"sides\". We knew that, we wanted to know what each one was. So when she walked back by I stopped her and asked what was in each one and she just did not want to tell us. I finally just asked if any had fish since I don't like fish and was told one did. But I would still go back because the food is that good!\n",

      "50 My husband and I love Korean food so we are always on the lookout for a good, authentic Korean restaurant. Because we travel to Nashville several times a year we asked around and were directed to Korea House. The first thing I noticed when walking into the small restaurant was the amount of Korean people having dinner. Good sign if you are looking for authentic Korean food! Second thing I noticed was how well worn everything was (in a nice homey way), another good sign to me. We ordered bulgogi (one chicken, one beef) and dolsot bibimbap. The food is amazingly good, so flavorful and spicy! The sides were great, I especially love the kimchi and the bean sprouts. Our server mixed the bibimbap for us and it was perfect. We will continue to frequent Korea House whenever we are in Nashville as the food is great. ***On a side note, the first time we visited the server we had (a young woman) was not very nice, she was almost hostile for some reason. We ordered three meals so we could share a little of each and take the rest back with us to eat over the next couple of days (unless my teen son gets hungry...then it is one meal). She had the nerve to look at us and say \"That's a lot of food...\" and just stood there. So what? We were paying for it so why the concern? The second time our server was an older woman and she was awesome! Couldn't have asked for a better sever. She sealed the deal for us as we had planned to look elsewhere if the service had been as poor as it had been the first time. She brought us boxes for our leftover food and didn't bat an eye when we ordered three meals :)\n",

I called ahead since I was running behind and they said be there by 9:30 and it would be okay. I arrived at 9:20 and the owner still turned me away. The previous time I waited in line til 9:30 but was turned away even though I arrived at 9:00. I will NOT be back again. From now on I will go to hai woon dai where the food is just slightly less quality than that at Korea house IMO. But the hospitality at hai woon dai is worlds better. They remember me each time and I only eat at hai woon dai a few times per year.\n",

I've had bad Korean food, and am not universally accepting of the genre. This is not bad Korean food. This is seriously delicious Korean food. The ban chan are like little gems set in front of you to sample and enhance your meal, and they make their own kimchi too. It's perfect on the hot-sour meter as far as I'm concerned. The only thing this place does not have (which I wouldn't expect them to) that I miss are soju cocktails. If you've had soju cocktails with the easy pour spout and the deceptively tiny glasses, you know what I mean. Otherwise love these welcoming, happy people and the food they make!!!\n",

Bulgogi was tender and juicy beef barbecue cooked with onions and scallions and eaten with white rice. The bibimbop is a dish with pickled carrots, radishes, lettuce, barbecue beef, egg, mushrooms, bean sprouts, and a hot and sweet sauce. It was beautiful and delicious. The seafood pancake (pajon) was really good--- thick, aromatic, crispy, with a tangy sauce, and small pieces of shrimp and squid in the pancake. The soondubujige, a seafood stew, was gobbled up by the family. All the dishes are served with small side dishes including kimchee, bean sprouts, tempura, omelettes, radishes, and cucumbers. Definitely recommend this place.\n",

You put the meat on a lettuce leaf, add the red sauce, some steamed rice, and shredded radish. YUM! This is the national dish of Korean and it is GREAT! Then we also get Kimchee fried rice - spicy and tasty. And Chop Cha. This is a noodle dish that has meat and veggies. It is lots of food, but you will want to taste it all and if there is any left take it home for later. Everyone that we have taken here loves it! It is in a strip mall.

      "80 While the food is good to the taste, the serving sizes are comical. They are VERY stingy with serving size. Also, if I dine in for lunch and get the lunch plate you get 3 sides BUT if get a lunch plate to go, you ONLY get 2 sides and again the portion size is not enough to have for the entire meal. Sides should be the same REGARDLESS to whether I dine in or take out! Also, yesterday (14 MAR 19) I ordered a plate to go and asked how much for a side of reddish and the size (because the last time I got the little plastic condiment size container for my sides, so I wanted to know if I paid for extra what size would it be. I was told the ounce size...IT WAS NO. Waiter tried to compensate by saying he FILLED the container to full for me - well DUH. Why should it not be full? Especially as small as it was - not my ounce for the price! I fully intend to speak to management my next visit. Times are too hard for us to pay for such small portions. We expect and demand better from American style establishments and ALL should be held to the same standard. UNACCEPTABLE.\n",

If this place was next door to me I would eat here five or more times a week. Yum.

I had not been there recently so I was unaware if any changes had been made. As I entered the parking lot I noticed that the main business sign still prominently displayed \" Sushi Bar \". I went in and was immediately seated as there were not many customers. I was given a menu and no sushi was on it. I asked a server and was told they did not do sushi anymore. As it was lunch I did not have time to go elsewhere so I ordered a spicy chicken box. The chicken was passable but I've had much better at other Korean or Vietnamese restaurants in town. The accompanying dishes were for the most part not very good. No sauce was served with the stuffed dumpling as you usually see. Service was okay but nothing was making up for the false advertising and mediocre food. You can get much better Korean at a better lunch price at several places in Huntsville. As I left I took another look at the sign to make sure I wasn't crazy. Nope, it still said \" Sushi Bar \"\n",

This week i am at home again visiting and i noticed this new korean restaurant...I Love Korea. It is right across the street from the original Korea House. I had the chicken bibimbop in the stone pot and it was excellent. It came out sizzling hot from the kitchen and the miso soup is some of the best i've had. The side dishes were three kinds of kimche, fishcakes and noodles but were tiny portions which could have been a bit larger i feel. My mother had the chicken terriyaki and that was awesome too.

When we walked in we were greeted immediately and seated in the \"party section\" in the back. They were very busy so this didn't bother us at all; we were just happy to get a seat that fast. We looked at the menu and our waiter was taking our order in less than 2 minutes. I ordered the Bulgogi Lunch Box and my husband ordered the rice dish with Bulgogi and a fried egg on top (I don't remember exactly what it was called). We received our miso soup and then our little side dishes of kimchi, radish, etc. very quickly. The food was great. The soup was served hot, with the little tofu pieces, and the side dishes were exactly what we expected. When I received my lunch box I was impressed because it looked and smelled amazing. My husband received his food about 3-4 minutes later. Because we didn't receive our food at the same time, we never got a check to go pay (we had to relay what we ordered to the cashier at the front), and also because the women next to us ordered some soup that smelled so bad (like hot blue cheese) that it was VERY hard to continue to eat our lunch without getting sick; I've decided to give them 4 stars instead of 5. The service and food was great so we will return, and I do highly recommend I Love Korea for great food for a great price. Hopefully when we do return no one will order that horrible soup again.

      "140 The restaurant is literally a few meters away from the tram station but is not in plain view so you can easily miss it if you are not paying attention or if you don’t know where to look. The fact there are some stairs very near is also not helping. However after you step in you realize that the inside is quite big and quite nice. The setting is very pleasing and the decor is retaining the Korean motives in clean modern lines. We didn’t know what to expect with respect to the food when we entered in. And we can not certify if is authentic Korean food. What we can say that it tasted very good. The service was also nice, no personal touch but fast and professional. We noticed near by a family with a small baby and they had a high chair. Overall a great find in Prague. We will probably return. P.S. if is a weekend is better to make a reservation.\n",

      "141 We visited this Korean restaurant as per recommendation and noticing that it was very close to our accommodation. We didn’t book in advance as it was only a Thursday evening, but upon arrival we considered ourselves lucky as we managed to get one of the last tables. There was a wide range of dishes on offer, predominantly different variations of bibimbap dishes but many others too. I ordered the Bulgogi Bibimbap (Number 2 on the menu) and my boyfriend ordered the Jeyuk-bokeum-bap (Number 8). Both dishes were served with a side of kimchi and my Bulgogi Bibimbap also came with a clear soup. Both dishes were extremely tasty and my boyfriend even joked about asking for the recipe as it was that good and he wanted us to make it back at home. The service was very prompt and the prices reasonably cheap, we paid around 500kc with a tip from what I can remember. Would highly recommend.\n",

I was impressed with the waitresses, they are kind, respectful & speak English, three characteristics that are hard to find in Prague (sorry to say that, they don't have customer service skills here). I was personally served by a blonde one (I'm sorry, I don't know her name). Despite I ordered something but I meant something else, she immediately went to the kitchen and got me what I wanted, literally in 5 minutes. Thank you so much!\n",

      "218 I/we have visited the place twice in the past month. One was a quick lunch (the place does not offer any special lunch menu) and the other was what was to be a decent birthday celebration. Food is great in terms of its variety, authenticity, and freshness. Other reviews testify to this, show you pics etc so no need to delve in detail on this. The service is, however, problematic. The lunch experience was below average, service-wise, in terms of attentiveness etc but since the place was pretty empty, it was bearable. However, the birthday celebration on Friday night occassion with a place having being completely packed revealed and amplified this general problem. The staff was very nervous as a line of guests waited inside and outside the restaurant demanding to be seated. Afyer being seated, I had to leave the table three times - first to ask for the menu card (after 20 minutes waiting and not seeing anyone to come and say even hello), second to ask where our soup was after another 30 mins of nothing happening after i brought a waiter with me to the table, and, third, the same with our main course somehow not making it to our table, again, after 30mins, with soup balls still on table!!! Next tables were not served any better but the international crowd of youngsters seemed to be patient if dissatisfied too. Additionally, the right side of the restaurant was very cold and we kept our winter jacket on at times. BOTTOM LINE: I Will give it a third chance as we live nearby but if the service is not substantially improved i will go elsewhere then. There is another jap-korean restaurant nearby (wont identify not to be blamed for favouring it) which, albeit more expensive, provides top service.\n"

      "233 Having lived in Korea for over two years, and being with a Korean, we were excited (but a bit skeptical) to find some Korean food next to our place. We went for lunch and ordered Bibimbap, Pajeon, and bulgogi kimbap. The restaurant's signature dish was delicious - on par with what you'd find in Korea! Flavorful, authentic, and chocked-full of various fresh veggies. We also appreciated that it wasn't served too hot. Our pajeon was solid; nice and crispy on the outside and soft inside with delicious bits of green onion and squid. The kimbap, a staple of my diet when I lived in Seoul, was a bit of a letdown. A tad bland and dry, you can see why they didn't name the place \"Kimbap.\" The meal wasn't cheap, but not prohibitively expensive either, though I'm used to paying less for similar dishes. The biggest negative of the meal was the lack of side dishes, as well as bland kimchi that seemed 'washed' in attempt to downplay its natural spiciness for the European market.\n",

      "284 We spent last 18 months traveling around. We were always looking for Korean bistro to fulfill our desire for our favourite Bibimbap. This actually never happened, because the best and only real Bibimbap for us is the one that Mr. & Mrs. Lee are serving in their restaurant. There is no better Korean restaurant in English and Spanish speaking world! Their recipes for Kimchi and Tuna soup are just perfect. Soup is so strong and tasty, it is a cure for any weakness.\n",

Thanks to Bibimbap Korea I was introduced to Korean food and it was love at first sight :) I am very happy that even though they've moved from near my office, now they are near my home and we go almost every week for dinner. Delicious food, esp. bibimbap and really nice service for a very reasonable price. The average item on the menu costs around 150-160 crowns. I couldn't recommend this restaurant more.\n"

All the food were very mediocre, when we started to think the pork bibimbap was quite good, the rice was piping hot but when we put the pork in the mouth, they were fridge cold, so just ate the rice without the pork. When we mentioned it after paying, the server said, the pork was precooked and stored in the fridge, they forgot to warm it up before putting them on the rice.\n",

For a plate of vegetable dumplings, fried squid that was thin and covered in panko and oily and a plain plate of beef short rib (£15!!!!!) bulgogi without rice or anything, we paid £33 - what the actual help?! The portions were tiny too. We were given tap water in a re-usable pink plastic water bottle you use to take water on your bicycle and then at the end of the meal, 2 slices of orange on a plate. By far the most bizarre and most expensive meal we have had which was not worth even £5 to make. We felt this was some kind of joke. Still can't quite believe it. Both of us a size 10 - we went for food afterwards. Unbelievable.\n",

I agree with other reviews, the starters are a bit expensive and the yaki soba was bland and not very nice. My friend wasn't that impressed with his meal choice either.

Reasonably priced and their hot pots are really nice. I've had better sushi but wasn't bad. My only gripe was that it took them a very long time to clear our table once we'd finished eating. But only a minor thing. Would recommend.\n",

      "352 Highly recommended. This place took me back to my time in South Korea, authentic Korean soul food that I dearly missed. Seeing the chef attend all tables and asking how the food was really blew me away. Something I haven't seen in a long time, great touch definitely felt the love in the cooking. Most of all its veggie friendly, no pork in the broths! Thank you for the great experience and catering for vegetarians. Our new favourite restaurant.\n",

Visiting with friends from London on a Wednesday night, I was a little disappointed to see it was a Korean and Japanese place and was even more disappointed in the menu. There was key Korean and Japanese dishes, but not enough of either.\n",

      "356 Had a staff night there on Thursday 17/03/2016. We were a table of 6 and I can tell that we all felt the same way. The food was really good and fresh. However, service was not that good. We asked for 6 wine glasses (BYOB by the way), and we had to ask them to change three of them as they were really dirty (one of them even had some salad on it!!!). Then, we ordered some starters to share which were all great and 6 main course. As 5 of us had our meals served after 45 minutes wait after we finished the starters (which were not cleared from the table), one of us didn't get his meal. We had to ask the waiter for the 6th meal, which they forgot about. I noticed during the dinner that other tables were not cleared until someone else was arriving... Overall, a descent restaurant with good prices but a poor customer service experience.\n",

The staff is very friendly and would advise on the menu. But the most amazing thing about them is that they do delivery, although not everywhere but if you are in the centre or around you are good. Me and my friends order delivery all the time and it's so useful especially during exam period when everyone is too busy with revision. But you have to order food for more than £20.

It's served in a hot earthenware bowl with boiled rice in the bottom (making it crispy), layered with cooked vegetable, choice of chicken, beef, pork, prawn or tofu (beef recommended and taken), and an egg so the flavours go down into the rice - served with your own bottle of red chilli paste so you can control how hot you want it. I loved it and can't wait to go back. We washed it down with a (375ml) bottle of 18% rice wine, that went well and had a clean slightly vodka-like flavour. With a couple of side dishes and salads, we happily paid £20 each and left feeling full and satisfied. The same menu is served for lunch, mostly at reduced prices - a definite bargain!\n",

The ambience was a bit on the dark side and it didn’t appear very clean with an open kitchen that looked like a corridor. Once we sat down we ordered Mandu which I guess is the Korean version of Gyoza. The flavour wasn’t too bad although I would have left it a bit more in the pan to get the pastry a bit crispier. The Seafood Pancake (which didn’t appear to have much seafood inside) with spring onion wasn’t too bad either although the middle was uncooked and had a gluey consistency. Then came the masterpiece! We orderered 2 katsu curry (Chicken and Pork) from the special lunch menu but we got was 2 cutlets in gloopy sauce that I believe is a different dish and it remainded me of branston pickle! I had the pork and the colour of the meat was almost black and had a funny taste. My fiancé’s chicken was a touch better but again it had a funny taste. We complained and they asked if we wanted something else and because we were famished we asked if we could have 2 portions of Mandu instead which were the best part of our meal but this time they arrived undercooked and one of them was cold in the middle. I don’t have a problem if they were frozen before but at least they could have been cooked properly. It is not that they were too busy either, there was us and another table, so why the rush? We complained again and the waitress then later on the owner pretended that there was a misunderstanding regarding the curry. Well, that wasn’t our problem as we had ordered from the daily special menu and there was only one curry option! Anyway the owner wanted us not to pay the bill but we insisted that we wanted too and at end we paid for the 2 dishes we ate. This has to be one of the most unpleasant meals for sometime!\n",

The staff are great and the lovely waitress who told me she was from Daegu was really friendly. I hope to go back once they are selling alcohol because the only thing that would make this better was if they also sold Makgeolli. As far as the food goes it was all exceptional. The bulgogi is as amazing as it should be and the bibimbap was delicious.

      "408 From the outside, Cafe Korea is just a restaurant in a strip mall. But when you go inside, it's a whole new world. I was stationed in Uijongbu and remembered delicious BBQ places where you can grill at the table. This is a Rolls Royce version of those BBQs. The service is outstanding and the food is delicious and bountiful. I got the Bulgogi entree and my Mom got Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop. We didn’t know that we also got all of these yummy side dishes too. The daughter of the owner came over to check on us. It was an excellent experience. I wondered if their food would taste like the Bulgogi I had in the 80’s back in Korea and it was! I have rated a lot of restauraunts. If I could have given this 6 stars, I would. It was $44 out the door including a generous tip.\n",

      "409 My daughter and I tried out Cafe Korea for a “special” dinner, and we were not disappointed. The price for the dinners using the grill is up there, but it was a relaxing interactive meal. They served our choice of proteins thinly sliced and marinated with vegis and then we grilled them at the table. Also came with rice and a variety of Korean side dishes. The staff was very helpful and friendly.\n"

One was kimche soup, which was well liked, one was dumpling soup, which was just okay, another was spicy pork dupbop which is a dish of vegetables, some pork and sweet potato noodles (delicious, but not sweet as you might think) over rice and one which was delicious, and other dish which I can't recall and was well liked.

      "465 I ended up going here twice on my most recent visit to London. Once of my own volition and again on the recommendation of a friend - I wasn't complaining. The first time I had the tofu salad and jeon, both OK for vegans, although a couple more members of staff could do with knowing what is and isn't vegan on their menu. These choices were decent if a little greasy. The second time when I went back I had the tofu bibimbap and that was pretty impressive. The restaurant is very close to Victoria station and not all that expensive. It was packed both nights and I would go again.\n",

      "466 A colleague recommended this place as I was meeting a friend straight from work and it was close by. Given that we went on a Monday evening and were starving at 6.30 we figured it would be pretty quiet there but the place was heaving - always a good sign. We had one of the set menus and I have to say it was all delicious. The staff were all friendly and realised that we hadn't had Korean food before so explained how we were supposed to assemble one of the dishes (we'd have worked it out but was nice to be helped) My only slight negative point was that the tea was very weak; I had the Korean tea which had some flavour but my friend had the green tea and said that it tasted of nothing but hot water. I will definitely be back\n",

      "467 What to say other than this place exceeds expectations. I'm very difficult to please when it comes to eating out and really struggled to choose from the menu as everything sounded good. The staff were brilliant, giving us time and answering many questions. I was recommended the kimchi soup which comes with rice. Others had the noodles or bibimbap. When they arrived, portions were huge but with lots of flavour. The bibimbaps were incredible but I think the kimchi soup won hands down. Hot, spicy and full of ingredients I can't wait to come back to have it again. Can't stress enough how great this place is!\n",

      "482 Perfectly located for the Apollo theatre (Wicked), this is a great place for a pre-show meal. They open at 5 and when we arrived at about 5 past there were already 2 tables seated. By half past the restaurant was full and people were waiting. We were asked if we had a reservation (which we didn't) and I would certainly recommend booking if planning to arrive any later than we did. The food was well explained on the menu and the friendly staff were on hand to help make recommendations. Service was extremely quick (in fact we were in and out in just over an hour) and the food is all brought out as soon as it is ready without a clear gap between courses. This might bother some people but I didn't feel like we were being rushed. The food itself was beautifully presented and of good quality. Having not tried Korean food before I found the flavours a little disappointing (slightly bland) compared to some other Asian cuisines, but I think that's more personal taste. Overall I would definitely recommend the place for a value for money pre-show meal if you like Asian food.\n",

We arrived at 5 as it was opening and the staff were lounging about in the dining area so not really a great first impression. As a vegetarian the choice was limited so I had the Tofu Udon and the ladies had Chicken Katsu Udon. The noodles were barely warm and generally the meal was bland and uninteresting. The people on the table across looked to have made a better choice with a colourful rice dish. Perhaps our fault but if experimenting with somewhere for the first time in future I will be asking for recommendations and help from the staff serving.\n"

      "524 This small, clean, friendly place is perfect for a pre-Hamilton (or whatever show you are seeing at the Palace) repas. Korean food can be light, even vegetarian, spicy or not depending on your preference, and the kimchee won't upset the people sitting next to you in the theatre. I had udon noodles, supposedly spicy; they weren't piquant but they were fresh and umami. My friend had bibimbap with tofu. Both dishes were generous and filling. We shared kimchee pancakes, like potato pancakes but crunchier. Service was unobtrusive and efficient. Arrive early for pre-theatre because it gets crowded the closer you get to show time.\n",

      "528 Went for dinner with my husband and ordered, Cucumber Kimchee, Beef Bimbibap, Spicy Chicken Bulgogi, Kimchee Jigae Ramen. We love the cucumber kimchee and beef bimbibap but the chicken and ramen was too spicy for us. However some people might like the 'spicyness' so this is relative. The atmosphere is typical asian cafe place but it did feel a bit cramp but I think that is because the restaurant was trying to pack as many seats as possible to maximum sales which is understandable. The service was good and the staff was friendly. Also, this place only take cash so bear that in mind. In summary, this is definitely an option for a pre-theatre meal and I would go back again if I am around the neighbourhood and if I crave for Asian food.\n",

The tofu was the best tofu I have ever eaten it was just delicious. It's a really cosy restaurant and because everyone is sitting quite close together you become quite friendly with the people around you if you want to.

      "We were seated as it opened at 5 as were several other tables; the service was efficient but not rushed - they are clearly used to the pre-theatre crowd. But oh my goodness, the food! It was delicious! A Korean food fan in our group ordered a variety of dishes for us and she was seriously impressed, I just kept eating. The food was fresh and plentiful and superb. So concentrated were we on our dinner, that we’d not noticed the restaurant was packed and folk were waiting.\n",

      "585 We were looking for a dinner before the Hamilton show nearby. We found a Korean restaurant which is my favourite food. We arrived at 530pm and there is not very busy. The decoration is cozy. But the table is a bit close to next table. The food served very quick. The waiter came to explain how we should enjoy the food. He is very friendly and we spend some time to talk to him about Korean culture as well. The food taste so good that make me feel like I am in Korean. We finished our dinner within a hour and people was waiting for the seat. Therefore we left and heading to our show.\n",

      "587 Meeting a friend for lunch we thought we would try Lime Orange. When we arrived it was really busy but there was a table for 4 available so we sat ourselves down and waited to be served. After five minutes we were told that as there was only 2 of us we had to move and join the table behind us. We did ask if we could stay on our table and other people join us but they wanted to keep the table for 4 free just in case a party of 4 walked in. So we joined the other table (although the current occupants were a little taken aback) but there really was not much room for 4 and couldn’t talk freely. Then table for 2 became available so we moved to the free table. We were then told we couldn’t have this table as it had been reserved! So no one waiting. A table for 4 and a table for 2 unused but we could only join a table already occupied by 2 people. At the point we felt very unwelcome and decided to leave. My view on the food can’t be included but we definitively did not feel the love! Looking at other posts it seems we aren’t the only ones dissatisfied with their seating technique. If you want Korean food then give it a try but if there are just 2 or less in your party then find somewhere a bit more welcoming.\n",

We arrived on time to be informed yes they had our reservation but they had no tables available. We would have to wait standing for maybe twenty minutes and then he could squeeze five of us onto a table for four. Said he was sorry and they just overbooked tables. This was said matter of factly -it would appear to be their normal practice. No free drink offered if we chose to wait. We left and found a good restaurant nearby. The front of house staff couldn’t have cared less. With such an indifferent cavalier attitude to customers you have to wonder what happens in their kitchen. Avoid at all costs.\n",

When I asked why I couldn't get a table, the waiter said if a party of 2 comes then they always have priority.

The appetizers were really small and the kimchi was not very pickled but rather mushy and not to much flavor. Also the barbecue was not crisp and not very well marinated. And to top everything we almost got embarrassed at the end when we were told that their card reader wasn't working and that we should go across the street to get some cash.\n"

Personally it was bad positioning as it was bitterly cold and every time someone came and went the cold air rushed in and it was not pleasant. Service was good. Food was good but I just feel it is a very tiny restaurant and there are too many tables crammed in and it makes getting comfortable and enjoying your meal not a great experience. I don't like the next table practically sitting in my lap when eating, but of course this is a personal thing and other folk may not mind this. For me it was a little bit like sardines in a tin, but as I say food good as was service. Don't think I would go back for a 2nd visit unless restaurant was quieter.\n",

The staff were quite slow, there was a considerable break between finishing our meal and having the table cleared, no one ever asked if we wanted another drink or dessert, just didn't seem very attentive. The food was ok, and reasonably priced, just didn't live up to the expectations I had after the reviews on here!

      "691 We went for lunch here before a trip to the theatre. It is quite a small place, but we were able to be seated right away. The menu has the usual Korean favourites, and the sizzling bibimbap dishes in particular looked very good! We had the bulgolgi beef and yukgae jang, with dukbokgi as a starter (which wasn't too spicy), and it was all high-quality. Our waiter was friendly and would helpfully explain to customers the usual way of eating particular dishes.\n",
      "감성을 입력하세요1\n",
      "692 When we discovered this local, family-run Korean place 2 years ago it immediately became a big hit with our office - multiple trips per week to begin with, and then settling at a consistent weekly or fortnightly visit ever since. I would bring friends & family here when visiting the city for the weekend, and advocate people go out of their way even to seek it out. Their yangyeum chicken starter was to die for, their bibimbaps tasy, and their pork bulgogi especially good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, my regular lunch pal and I have noticed a steady decline in portion size and food quality over the last 6 months or so, alongside a slow rise in prices. We have often remarked before while dining here, how pleased we are that this brilliant little friendly restaurant had not succumbed to the trend only too often seen at local establishments that gain popularity - that temptation to try to further increase profit margins by switching to cheaper cuts of meat, changing suppliers (and suffering a noticeable dip in quality), and getting stingy with portions. Unfortunately this has now happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "First our beloved yangyeum chicken - previously so good that we had visited and ordered only two portions of this delicious starter each as our meals - was switched from a generous pile of easy-to-eat boneless chicken (thigh I'd guess?), to chicken wings instead - without any change to the menu I should add. Next, the generous portion was downsized to just 5 wings (tested on multiple occasions for consistency). And finally, the price was actually INCREASED.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now many people very much enjoy chicken wings, so what's wrong with that, you might ask? Well, for the tourists who might wander in once on their visit to see Buckingham Palace, absolutely nothing. But for those living or working locally, we know better. We know what came before. And I'll tell you this for nothing - bitesize pieces of dark meat are far easier to eat cleanly with chopsticks while on an office lunch break or having a business meeting, than fiddly little battered wings smothered in a very sticky spicy-sweet sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've also observed a decrease in the bibimbap sizes, smaller portions of accompaniments, increased greasiness and lower quality of meats (e.g. the belly pork), and further subtle price increases across the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we feel particularly strongly just because of how much love we had for this place initially, and what a stark contrast there is. The first time we went after they'd made the thigh to wing switch, the waiting staff actually apologized to us for the change when we ordered, knowing full well we'd be disappointed. Now, they simply look at us apologetically when we arrive in the doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, while we've really been trying to keep coming, our regular visits may now have come to an end, the decline has crossed a threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like many of the best things in life, it seems it couldn't last forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR - if you're in town for the weekend, fancy some Korean and are in the area, you could do far worse than Lime Orange. If however you've been before and loved it, say a year ago or so - don't come back, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n"

The food was not remotely satisfying, enough nor delicious and for the portion it was expensive. The beer was not even cold enough. Sorry lime orange this is not good enough! Even delivery to a close destination must be to a high standard\n",

      "705 A little Korean restaurant - 3 mins walk from Victoria station (opposite wicked the theatre show) tucked away next to Russell hotel!! - looks nothing special but the food was sooooo good. Soft drink, starter & main was £15 including tip. they do a set menu for £18.50 including a glass of wine. My friend had the katsu curry with udon noodles & I had the tofu soup. Would go back tomorrow - haven't ever had Korean before but it was busy & bustling - you can book but only over the phone & not on the day. We walked in - we had to pay cash as the machine wasn't working but all good. A little secret gem of you are near Victoria station\n",

      "706 I'd never had Korean food before so I tried the Katsu curry which I've had at Japanese restaurants & really enjoyed so I had a basis for comparison. It was very different but equally tasty, coming with noodles instead of rice and a much tarter and thinner sauce. The green tea ice-cream was also very nice. Service a little slow, although if you intend to make a whole evening of it then that's not really a problem. Small restaurant, I'd advise booking as it's clearly popular at the weekends. I'd go again.\n",

I did because even though I was there at 5:30pm by six it was full and when I left at 6:45 they were queuing outside.

I would never have entered the restaurant had it been by looks alone, as the exterior is not very inviting but once inside the door the room was clean, quite smart and we were shown to our table by a very polite and friendly waiter. We got a table at 5.30 with ease, and soon after the tiny restaurant quickly filled up. We were given advice about food choices. The BBQ chicken was delicious and sizzlingly hot, and the pork bibimbap was equally good. Although we ordered rice with the chicken, we didn't need it as we shared both dishes, and there was plenty for two ladies.\n",

Our daughters, who at first protested as we were visiting 'asian again', really loved the tasty food. Service was fast and helpful and accommodating. Highly recommended!\n",

Double delights! We will definitely visit again - i loved my bimbimbap dish and the calamari starters were perfecct.\n",

      "767 I'm shocked that I have lived in this area for over 10 years and have only now discovered this wonderful local restaurant! It's conveniently located right next to Victoria Station, but unless you are visiting the Apollo theatre (right opposite) or are a commuter taking the bus outside the restaurant, it's easy to miss. Vauxhall Bridge Road certainly isn't the most scenic road, so probably not too many people just going for a stroll in the arae..However, I can only recommend taking a detour for this little gem.\n",

      "All the dishes I have ordered so far have been excellent, I particularly liked their Japchae. Every day they have a different special lunch dish and for £3.99 take away or £4.99 eat-in it's incredible value for money. For London in general, but particularly for this area. Portions are generous!\n",

The food was also really good e.g. the bibimbap. The lighting in the restaurant was a bit dim when you look from afar, so I was mistaken that it's closed until I take a closer look. Glad I didn't turn away in the end!\n",

      "774 I was taken here by a friend. We shared two starters. Both were excellent. I having never had Korean food I was unsure but this put me at ease. For mains we had be sizzling bowls of veg with an intact egg yoke. Mine also had chicken. This was filling and interesting. But not quite at the same level of yumminess but fully palatable and filling. Maybe owing to my own eating style by the end the food had blackened to the metal bowl and was less tasty. To be fair this was just the dregs so shouldn't put people off the food. For desert we had green tea ice cream... the taste of this was excellent. What was more questionable (and I think a marmite option) was the texture. It had green tea in it so was bitty. I am still undecided if I liked it. My friend definitely didn't. However two colleagues at work both said they love the bits! So I guess try and see its only a couple of quid.\n",

Not sure if the staff were on different shift patterns, but the waiter was extremely busy on his own for the 1st hour which was OK for us as we was the first ones in so no issues with service.\n",

      "796 I came to know this restaurant after a series of research in narrowing down the best Korean restaurants that fits our criteria (including price range, location, atmosphere etc). I was a little sceptical at the beginning, as there weren't a lot of reviews on Tripadvisor for this place despite the high ratings. To be fair, Lime Orange isn't one of the most well-known Korean restaurants in town, but we like how it is one of the few that's close to my friend's hotel at South Kensington (as most Korean restaurants are gathered around Tottenham Court Road/Holborn area). The restaurant itself is very easy to find as it is located on the main road, right opposite Apollo Theatre (known as the theatre for Wicked the Musical). Price range is also very reasonable, and the quality of food is no less than that of the better known Korean restaurants (such as Kimchee). The portion of food is also very decent. For appetizers, we had jap chae (a small dish of Korean glass noodles, it was the best jap chae I had in London), vegetable mandu (5 Korean dumplings, they were very crispy) and a small bowl of kimchi (it was quite spicy, but it would be better if there was more depth in flavour rather than spice alone). For main course, we had a beef bibimbap, a kimchi soup pot (which actually gives you a complimentary bowl of rice, but it isn't specified on the menu. I quite like the pork that comes with it) and fried seafood udon (I like the flavours and the wide variety of seafood). Between the four of us, we had a really enjoyable meal as it was a nice casual place to dine and chat. The only downside for us is that the staff could have been a little bit more attentive by serving water regularly or perhaps just look around more often, otherwise everything was perfect. In general though, the staff there are all very friendly. On a final note, the bill came down to £40, which was 10 quid/pp. You definitely get more than you pay.\n",

      "816 I called up yesterday (Wednesday) morning and booked a table for 6pm as was seeing Billy Elliot in the theatre opposite. I booked this with an open mind and was blown away! It's a very small, intimate restaurant that appears to be family run. I had the japchae to start which was beautiful, even if I was the only person in the restaurant to eat with a fork! My partner had the deep fried prawns which were MASSIVE! They looked beautiful but our main meals came out before we'd finished our starters so I didn't get to try the prawns. For main I had the beef bibimbap. I am so glad I went with the crowd. This dish was DELICIOUS. Rice with egg, tasty beef, spinach, onions - absolutely delicious and fun because you get to mix the ingredients and add sauce to your tasting. My Partner had pork belly with lettuce (taco-style). He said his meat was a bit gristly but the flavours were really good, as were the dipping sauces. It is very fast service here which was great as within an hour we had a starter, main, beer, and sake. In total we spent £53 which is a little pricey but definitely worth it for a treat. The sake wine is delicious, as is the Asahi beer. The restaurant picked up in business by about 6.30/7 and had a really nice atmosphere to it. If I go to Victoria Palace Theatre again, I'll be sure to stop here to try something new!\n"

      "In that context, we were very happy to find Lime Orange. The fact that the restaurant was packed was encouraging, so we decided to dive in.\n",
      "I really wanted to like the place, but left disappointed. The problem was that everything we had was desperately bland and lacking in taste. We started with the fried sweet and sour fried chicked. The sweet taste of the sauce decidedly overpowering any chicken that may have been there. Then came the seafood pajeon (korean pancake). It was very anticlimatic, and clearly undercooked. When this was pointed out, they took it back and brought another one after a while…which was not much better. We’ve had much tastier in other places (Asadal for example).\n",
      "Then came the bibimbaps (we had pork and beef), which seemed to be what everyone comes for…\n",

The first thing that you notice is the attentive service. You are greeted and seated immediately you walk in by very polite, friendly staff. When you are ready to order a waiter or waitress appears straight away and if you look up because you need something else you are quickly attended to. The menu includes Korean favourites and, curiously, a sushi selection. The food is tasty and arrives very quickly. Wine is about the cheapest you will find in this part of London.\n",

Made me think the food was warmed up as it was delivered so quickly. Menu exciting and varied - both Japanese and Korean options and waiter advised on how to choose and select options. Unfortunately I must have chosen a duff off the menu as my Katsu Chicken Udon was far noodles with some deep friend chicken on it. The 'special sauce ' accompanying it was - I swear - Hp brown sauce. Still Udon noodles were tasty. Perhaps I just choose the wrong food but rest of table said things were nice but not great. Unfortunately I think it's a case of a restaurant getting away with serving poor food to a tourist market (it's right near Wicked and Billy Elliot). Touch too expensive for what we got.

      "878 I have eaten here twice in the last month. The first time was in a group of 6 before seeing Billy Elliot. The waiter was very patient with us explaining the menu & happily explaining what everyone else was eating as we were looking around. He recommended the Kimchee Jeon as a starter which was delicious. The tempura was plentiful. I'm a vegetarian and had the hot stone pot Tofu Bibimbap. This is a bowl of rice, vegetables and tofu. There is a raw egg yolk on the top that cooks as you mix it all in with chilli sauce (you do this yourself so choose how spicy you want it!). It was delicious!\n",

      "The second time I took my God-daughter as we were seeing Wicked. It's literally over teh road. I had the same again (it was so delicious first time around) and she had the fish Bobimbap - there was plenty of different types of fish and she loved it. Once again brilliant service and delicious food.\n",

      "Some advice definitely call up and book in advance. It's so busy and popular. We booked both times, lots of disappointed people or people who had to wait. It's quite small so there's not lots of room to wait in. Also they prefer cash - they do take cards.\n",

The kimchee pancake as a starter is superb, as is the black sesame ice cream for dessert!\n",

We tried a range of dishes, including the Raw Beef Bibimbap, Chicken Katsu Udon, Salmon Teriyaki and Yukgae Jang, and teverything we had was bursting with flavour and well prepared. This is good Korean food, with plenty of options to include everyone (now also very curious about their sushi too)\n",

There was plenty to chose from on the menu and the staff were happy to advise choices to our taste. We shared some chicken dumplings to start which were lovely. I had the pork bulgogi which was really, REALLY good! I had it with lettuce and rice as advised (and costs extra); you wrap it and eat with your hands - yum. It was a big portion and I thought the rice was unnecessary - but the lettuce was a nice fresh way to serve and enjoy the pork and I might try it at home. The other half had katsu chicken with udon noodles - it was also really tasty and a good generous portion. We were both chuffed, especially as he works a stones' throw and will be able to pop in and enjoy the lunchtime specials. Location is very convenient for Victoria, just a 2 minute walk, behind the Apollo theatre.\n"

I thought the prices were reasonable, 2 starters, 2 main courses, 3 sides, 2 puddings, large glass of wine, coke & bottle of water was £55 inc service charge.

We stayed in Lime Orange until all other diners have left. We left the restaurant at 10:50pm and then we noticed the closing time was 10:30pm!! How kind was the staff not to patronise us regarding the closing hour. We were so grateful and slightly embarrassed for keeping her so late!

There was also a 10% service charge added to the bill. I suggested he add a statement to the menu noting the extra charge for the rice and the lettuce. He good naturedly removed the excess charges. The 10% service charge was not amended and no record of our meal was provided following our cash payment. We would eat here again in spite of non disclosure of costs involved.\n",

      "But after that I would have to say that service was average at best. Although the food service was rather slow, especially considering we were one of four tables in that evening, I would never complain when the food is as good as it was. However, we did outline upon arrival (at 8.30pm) that our colleague needed to leave at 9.45pm for a conference call but come 9.40pm he still didn't have his main meal. Not a problem normally but our circumstances meant this caused quite the issue.\n",

      "What irked me the most was the general service, which was a shame after such a positive start. In between serving and going to kitchen the staff stood with their back to the restaurant chatting among themselves by the till. This made it nigh on impossible to place a drinks order and it took me leaning across into their conversation to get their attention for the water we had ordered 10 minutes earlier.\n",

      "The restaurant bills itself as Korean BBQ and there are even gas grills built into some of the tables. Our table had one but the only downer of taking the recommendations were that none of our dishes incorporated a BBQ element, which in hindsight seemed odd and an opportunity missed by the staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service aside it must said the food was very, very good. Everything was fresh, tasty and the we all thoroughly enjoyed every dish we shared from the pickled beansprouts, vegetable dumplings, extremely refreshing cucumber dish to the lemon chicken, noodles and beef - to name but a few....I think we over ordered somewhat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another big bonus was the price. 4 people, multiple bottles of beer, wine, two courses each and sharing sides all came in at a very reasonable price of around £20 per head.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two final points are the reason I have bumped this up from Average to Very Good. Poor service can easily be corrected and can be down to the individuals on the night but food of this quality at this price deserves to be shouted about.\n"

      "927 I have been to this restaurant twice I suppose. The experience was pretty good for me, although my Korean friend wasn't too satisfied. It served Japanese food previously but now I suppose they focus on Korean food which probably is a right decision as they are Korean not Japanese. I had Pajeon and Bibimbap, Pajeon was crispy and lots of seafoods are mixed too, though my Korean friend told that they already prepared it a while ago and reheated (re-panfried) again now, which you never know... at least for me it was crispy and nice :-) Stone-bowl of Bibimbap was well heated so that you have a little bit of burnt rice that I really appreciate. Korean lady seems smiley and nice, I think it's a nice little Korean restaurant in Victoria.\n",

The dishes served to our table of 7 all were beautifully presented and the flavours of them matched this. Price was ok, and the restaurant is very close to Victoria Station and the theatres near by. It is a small restaurant plain and clean. Service was good. The toilets could have been a little cleaner and the space provided for this facility is very small. But I am not really complaining, just pointing out this fact!\n",

Had another dish with 4 types of meat (can't remember what the dish is called) but it was really tasty as well. The meats were well-marinated.\n",

Located only 2 min walk from Victoria Station it was very easy to get to. We were there pretty early, about 17:30, and we were seated directly. Service was very nice the whole time. We had one of the set menues and some sake. All courses was perfect and you won't leave Lime Orange hungry 'cos you get big portions. It is in my opinion not pricey, especially not considering the quality of the food. Our bill came out at £55 for 5 dishes and a bottle of sake.

It was good but not as good as the bibimbap. My favorite part about Korean food is the banchan, so on the second visit i ordered the mixed banchan (called something else on the menu) and it came with pickled bean sprouts, radish, cucumber and the green spinach-like vegetable. It was not was I was used to. What I typically love was not done right, so skip this. The cucumber was extremely vinegary and sweet, inedible. The greens and bean sprouts were ok. So my suggestion so far is to stick with the bibimbap. I'll go back again for that!\n",

We like to try out different cuisines so gave Lime Orange a go based on reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. This restaurant is at the 'unfashionable' end of Vauxhall Bridge Road and looks uninspiring from the outside. Step inside and it looks like a cafe, no scenic views from the window. But, the service is flawless, the food great and If you are new to this, they will advise you. Terrific fresh food, served quickly, great prices. Loved it !!\n",

Lovely modern decor inside, really fast wireless Internet, service with a smile and really really great Chicken Katsu Udon. I am a huge fan of Udon noodles and rarely manage to find a place that makes them just so. Needless to say I fell for this place and went right back the next day even though we weren't going to watch a musical afterwards. If you're a fan of noodles or Asian food, do give it a try! :)\n",

The waiter explained the menu and made some recommendations on ordering the lettuce to wrap around the meat which was very helpful as this was our first experience of Korean food. The food was excellent, well cooked and tasty although I would have welcomed a gap between our starters and main course, which arrived before we'd finished eating.

No singing-dancing show was featured this particular evening and staff lacked sufficient communication skills outside Korean or Chinese.

Watch out for the solo drum performance- my favorite. It was amazing to watch how the waitresses continue to serve whilst in between their costume changes.

      "The main highlight starts around 730-ish after the first few plates were served. The waitresses gave a warm up song and dance, distributed bouquets of plastic flowers to each table (Hell, I thought I was given one for being cute). A chubby girl sat behind the drums and delivered a heart-thumping solo. There were dances in traditional costumes; look out for the thin but dazzlingly beautiful girl who is the designated \"spinner\", her part of the dances include several whirling solo (think of a female whirling dervish you would propose marriage to, in a heartbeat)\n",

I felt they were quite friendly, especially considering that the place was full and only a handful of girls had to run the entertainment, change costumes repeatedly, and act as waitresses. The girl who played the yanggeum (Korean dulcimer) and the girl who played the drums were amazing. If you consider that all the girls could speak Korean, Chinese, and at least a little bit of English, and could dance and play instrumetns and wait tables well, it is truly amazing. I was given a bouquet of flowers used during the show at the end by one of the girls (although I wasn't able to take it home). I have spent a lot of time in South Korea and in Asia in general and I can speak Chinese, so maybe I felt less culture shock in general and was able to understand some of what they were saying with other customers. They could speak English also, some more than others, but that was ok, because if one could not understand or respond well, she could get another. The restaurant is connected to the North Korean government from what I have read, the girls might come from elite families, the politics might be distatsteful, but a stand alone review should give it a very high rating. The girls were very remarkably talented and were friendly, the bibimbap was terrific. The hors d'ouevres were not remarkable, but I can't think of any time in my life where I got a show, a meal, and a cultural experience for 15 dollars including a glass of ginseng wine.\n",

      "982 went here for the show and dinner and, in some ways, its quite an experience. by luck we arrived right before the show. food was overpriced but the show was free. the food was standard korean, cold buckweat noodles, sweet and sour pork ribs, etc, and was pretty decent. the show however is the main attraction. its bizzare, like an 80s japanese pop music performance interspersed with random mini acts. the girls sing, play mozart on the violin, do some traditional dances etc, all choreographed to strobe lights and disco balls. they pretend to be happy and laugh the whole time, but you can tell they are not. in fact its known they are basically slaves and going to the restaurant is considered unethical by some, so three stars. im american and went to see north koreans with my bare eyes. one of the servers touched my hand during the meal. interesting.\n",

      "The menu is extensive but many people make the mistake of ordering Chinese dishes. This mistake will negatively color your experience. My recommendation: order a large bowl of very special cold Pyongyang noodles (one per person as these are not sharable) and the kim chee. You will not be disappointed and you will feel that the meal and entertainment were a tremendous value. This is one of those extremely delicious meals I can still taste and dream of having again...\n",

It was my first time meeting North Koreans and it was equally unnerving and exciting at the same time. They don't speak English so we ordered in Korean (they speak much differently than South Koreans, but it's understandable). The cold noodle soup (they call it \"rengmyun\") was really good and made the authentic old-fashioned way without any artificial ingredients liks MSG. They asked us about life in America and once my wife got to talking, they wouldn't leave our tableside. In fact, 2 of them stayed by our table for the entire meal, which gave me a bit of indigestion. They were obviously curious. In the end, it was a unique experience that I couldn't have at home and that was worth the price (which is more typical of what you'd pay in America for this kind of meal).\n",

Don't think for a minute that this a social enterprise, just a way for the NK gov't to get some exposure and money. Food was plentiful and well-prepared, if you like vats of kimchee with everything.

It's more of a bizarre banquet hall with live shows every night, alternating between rock shows and traditional dancing. Enjoying a beer while watching a 20 year old North Korean girl rocking out to a manic drum solo is priceless. Also priceless is trying to convince the staff, who are all the chosen few who get to leave North Korea for the green pastures of Cambodia, that they should pop to an internet cafe on their lunch break and explore the wonderful world of google.\n",
