0,Traveltubbies,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,An interesting introduction to North Korean food,"Our first dining experience in a North Korean restaurant, totally run and operated by women folks from North Korea. If you are there for dinner, you could get to enjoy the performances - traditional and modern from waitresses that double up as performers. Waitresses were friendly and despite the fact that they have to multi-task, did not slow down the service.

The whole experience was quite strange. Food wise, that's not too bad at all but I would not return just for the food and the performance. Once is good enough.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
1,WilliamBaek,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,Great Taste,"It was my first meal in North Korean restaurant.
Comparing to similar Korea food restaurant, the interior is simpler and atmosphere is rather nothing special. However, the food was great.
I ordered ""So Yukgejang"", spicy beef soup with a bowl of rice and the taste was one of the best for such soups.
I was alone there for my lunch but was served by two beautiful ladies though out the meal and it was pleasant experienced to chat with various topics with North Koreans.
Highly recommended to try food there and have a chat with them.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
2,n0butakai,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,Typical North Korean restaurant for non-Korean,"Food are generally good. Tried lunch-Bulkogi-grilled beef and Reimen-cold noodle, which were not bad, or could say even better than expected. Reasonably priced. Served by beautiful waitressesabout, most probably selected ones, who
spoke English and/or Japanese. Rather strange setting, many long and big tables, mainly for group guests. Better ask for a smaller table.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
3,Lai Yoke L,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,Worth a visit,"Food is generally good. Worth mentioning are kImchi which is mild spicy version, chewy tasty stirred fried beef & excellent scallop; & not forgetting the spicy taufu soup. The waitresses dressed in Korean traditional dresses will go up the stage for musical performance around 8 pm, which is kinda interesting.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
4,hanneetan,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,Good food in a very bizarre atmosphere,"We've passed by the place a couple times and were always curious about what goes on inside and what North Korean cuisine is about. When our friends came for a visit, we thought what better way to entertain them after reading the reviews online.

Food was really really delicious. The fried sesame leaves were a surprise. We love the topoki (rice cake), kimchi and especially this cold pork slices dish.

We were late for the show and yes, our waitress too left us midway service and hopped on the stage to perform. Show starts at 7:30pm every nite. It was a hoot just watching the whole fanfare but we had a tonne of fun. The only drag about the place was the chain smoking customers. Will we be back? Maybe when we have friends in town to entertain.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
5,housewifelet,Pyongyang Restaurant,1.0,retro in a bad way,"This restaurant is like the setting of a 60s Bond movie. Food overpriced and too spicy for my sensitive palette. Waitresses creepy and unfriendly, only smiling when presenting the bill. An alienating experience. Was so hungry after, had to buy so.e dumplings from a roadside stand .","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
6,CathieKSA,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Food with Entertainment,"Be sure to try the fried sesame leaves. Food was good, and at 8:00 a dancing and singing show started. It lasted about 35 minutes. I had expected propaganda because I heard there would be some, but there was not. Table service was OK but not great -- a bit difficult to get our waitress's attention.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
7,Robert T,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,A second degree kitsch experience,We had a feeling of North Korea for the evening. The food is honest and good and generously served. The waitresses are North Korean and they propose a stage performance which is taking you in another world and time. Definitely a place to stop by when you are in Phnom Penh,"['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
8,Z R,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,Authentic North Korean style,"I have been to several North Korean restaurants in several cities, they are pretty similar in many ways. Nothing special if you have been to a North Korean restaurant, but if you are familiar with the Korean food often seen in South Korea, some dishes with the same names are worth tasting. North Koreans make kimchi with a different way, very unique. Not the best place if you expect a conversation with your friends, because their music is loud and are the reason a lot of people going there for, and who knows what the waitresses would do when they hear what you are talking about, they all speak Khmer, English and apparently Korean very well.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
9,Enemalm,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,A very strange place,"In the middle of Phnom Penh you'll find this strange place. The waitresses - all very beautiful and look exactly the same - are sent here from North Korea and stay for about three years. The purpose: to ""inform"" us about how fantastic there home country is.

The food was quite good, actually not so different from Cambodian food, but we avoided dog and some other strange dishes.

At 7.30 (this was on a Friday) the show started. All of a sudden our waitresses stopped serving food and got on stage. They danced something that reminded me of Sound of Music. And then they sang Honey, honey (Abba) and one of the played the violin good enough to get a job in any simphony orchestra. In the end they picked up three electric guitars and played.

The whole show was just so bizarre that we sat laughing all the time. We brought our three children and they didn't like the food so much but enjoyed the show.

Of course, you should not support the regime of North Korea. I feel a bit ashamed about it, but it really was an interesting experience.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
10,sahast,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Unique...,Frequent this unique place... tasty north korean food accompanied by the performance of waitresses... a musical dinner.. a must to visit...,"['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
11,foursix_nine,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,Rare North Korean experience,"I never thought that I'd be getting any sort of north Korean experience while I was in Cambodia. But it's like a buy one get one, fly to Cambodia, and see North Korea! They show was amazing, I enjoyed it a lot, I was totally awed by the way they spun and twirled, and the many many instruments that could play! They don't allow you to take pictures inside, but they won't ask you to delete your photos either once you get your chance to. The food was okay, but just order a simple dish or something and just enjoy the show!","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
12,Ilin C,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,"Interesting experience, good food, but not as freaky as otherwise thought","Heard a lot about this place. One of our visitors said was his favorite restaurants in Phnom Penh--could not wait to try it. It was interesting and unusual from a Western perspective, but definitely not as freaky as others might think. The food was good, not the best Korean food I have ever had (had North Korean food in Seoul which was better). The pork ribs and bimbimbap at a hot stove pot was pretty good. The dumpling and the vegetable dish were nothing to write home about. The waitresses were definitely quite talented, well-dressed and well-groomed. My friends thought they look angry from time to time--they were a bit stressed since they had to wait on all customers and to perform as well. Don't expect that they will come by to chat with you. The waitresses and the show definitely were trying to reinforce the traditional expectation of women being very thin, submissive and gentle. No wonder most of the patrons there tonight were males. Who knows how much of the show were truly north Korean or modified to feed a particular expectation? The restaurant is closed by 9 pm which I did not expect. Overall not very memorable, food was only alright--would not likely go back as the place did allow smoking which always put a big dent on the overall dining experience.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
13,The_Nomadic_Doctor,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,The ultimate freak show!!,"I have seen and eaten at many freaky restaurants in Africa and Asia, but this is restaurant is a different ball game altogether. It felt like I was in a place meant for North Korean propaganda and that experience alone deserves five stars.

Food is decent. Yes, there is dog meat if you want to try it. There is a limited beer selection.

But the best part of the restaurant is the waitresses and the videos. All waitresses are made to look like dolls and perform in between serving your food. Expect anything from a covering of Celine Dion to hardcore rock music. My waitresses hurriedly dropped food at my table and rushed to get on stage. It was quite the spectacle. And then there are the videos. Lush landscapes and beaches, which I assume are meant to project N.Korea is a good light.

Definitely visit if you are in the area.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
14,fauziah z,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,Unique Experience of North Korean Restaurant,"The food quality is excellent. But more interestingly is the multi-talented waitress. They were wearing similar dress, and they are very beautiful. These waitress serve dishes for you and then they skillfully perform sing, dance, and play band! Amazing.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
15,bakupaku,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Ought to try it....,"This restaurant is at the main road of Monivong Bld. We were sceptical after reading the reviews n possible motives behind it, however we decided to try it since we will never visit Pyongyang. Yes,all the waitresses are dressed in yellow n red chiffon hanbok,same shoes,same scrunchy n similar hairstyle etc. They are soft-spoken, pretty n friendly with the Korean guests. The food is rather similar to South Korean's,or it's just those dishes that we ordered. The kimchi with pork ($8) was good, not sour or too oily. The dog soup ($12) is probably an acquired taste, with lots of spice n some chilli. The boiled mackerel fish ($10) is yummy for fish lovers. Jinro Soju is a tad too expensive for our liking, at $6. The performance starts at 8pm, with the waitresses singing, dancing n playing guitar, drum, keyboard n gu zheng! Very impressive! Definitely worth a visit for the curious, but pls bear with those ppl smoking in the air-conditioned restaurant.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
16,3030orthereabouts,Pyongyang Restaurant,1.0,Do you like funding North Korea's elite?,"This whole series of restaurants serve as nothing but a cash collector for the NK government. If you don't mind that...

Get the dog stew, it was pretty good. In fact all the food was pretty good. It's expensive for PP but then again you are paying for the Hennesey drinking habits of an entire country's plutocracy.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
17,ozinmilan,Pyongyang Restaurant,1.0,Don't bother,"Avoid Avoid Avoid
The service received (or lack of) was disgraceful.. it was the worst I have ever received in any restaurant in the world.
After being made to feel extremely uncomfortable, we walked out not ordering anything, vowing never to return again ....
Do not bother spending your money and your time there. Plenty of other restaurants in Phnom Penh to choose from where you are treated with respect and courtesy, something this restaurant lacks","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
18,ruo,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,Great show and good food!,"This is a restaurant that is definitely worth a visit. Heard from a friend that it is one of the only two North Korean restaurants that is not in North Korea. Food there is on the expensive side (cost us USD 34 for a stir fried pork, dumplings, kimchi soup, beef fried rice and drinks), but the show in itself is worth it! Food was pretty good as well!

The show consists of a series of dancing, singing and percussion. It starts at 8pm, so you may want to go slightly earlier to have your dinner and concentrate on the show when it starts. You are also not allowed to take pictures.

We went at about 8pm when the staff are preparing for the show and they looked a bit flustered and service was a little rude. However, this changed completely after the show and they were really friendly and asking whether you enjoyed the food and the show.

Highly recommended place!!!! Most tuk tuk drivers should know where it is so it should not be difficult to get there!","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
19,MikeFrommer,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Wacky yet strangely enthralling,"If you don't mind propping up the North Korean regime then take a visit to Pyongyand, probably the closest to North Korea you will ever get. In line with other reviewers very bizarre to see the waitresses suddenly performing rousing songs on stage. Also had to chuckle when we saw stewed dog on the menu - no we did not order it!","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
20,MrsSoT,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,Words fail me...,"This is the restaurant equivalent of smoking DMT. You do it once and appreciate the experience and then never do it again because you fear for your mental health. I felt really wierd being there as its like supporting the North Korean Government who didn't get this well known by being happy fluffy hippies. The waitresses are cold and unsmiling (only my male mates were too impressed by them to tell. Hand picked apparently...). After half an hour of kimchi and incredibly expensive beer, they launched into this colourful, whirling, screeching show with ""happy"" smiling faces for the best part of an hour before going back to being grim and austere again. The place has the weirdest vibe of anywhere I've ever been. There wasn't much after dinner banter. I think we were all in a little shock. Like I said, it was a great experience and I'm glad I went but wow. Would I go back? Maybe just once...","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
21,MonchichiCairns,Pyongyang Restaurant,2.0,Lost for words,"Sitting down and reading the rather high prices on the menu at this restaurant I figured I must be missing something. The large, unattractive, brightly lit room was full of customers. The service was sporadically slow and unfriendly. The food was nothing to write home about.
Which left me scratching my head, why were there some many people here?
And then it happened.
The lights were dimmed as images of serene forests and waterfalls looped on the flat screen TV. A piano accordion suddenly appeared and the waitresses began singing. There were fake bouquets of flowers, costumes resembling the ugly duckling after she grew into a beautiful swan, heart shaped maracas, mostly North Korean karaoke songs and a random version of 'On Top Of The World' by the Carpenters. The highlight was the waitresses rocking out on electric guitar, bass guitar and a drum solo.
Yes it was overpriced. Yes it was extremely weird. Yes I would never go back, but without a doubt, I will never forget it.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
22,woodsmen_11,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,What a dinner and a show,"This is another one of those best kept secrets. Firstly as a westerner you will feel like the only person there, you will be, the place is full of Koreans and some other Asian nationalities. The place is brightly lighten. The menu was interesting, guess there is no real difference between South Korean and North Korean cuisine, either that or we did try some of the more unique offerings. The waitresses are a highlight, wearing very bright almost brides dresses, they are very friendly and speak perfect English........BUT then......they double as the cast of the most fantastic restaurant show I have seen. Loads of fun and just a overall great experience. Go experience, you will not be disappointed. An absolute treat.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
23,EurasieTravelAsia,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,"She can be waitress, singer and....","If you look for quiet place I guess it is not the right place for you, since they have live music, smoking, speaking loudly (Korean and Chinese).

What impressed me a lot is waitress there she play as many role. She can be waitress, singer, instrument. When is the time, most of waitress will be on stage, sing, dance.....","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
24,FnBinPP,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,North Korean cultural centre,"If you fancy Korean food in phnom penh this is the place. Decent food in aircon but a must see floor show (about 7pm). All singing, all dancing north Korean culture and propaganda! Top value entertainment on the quirky scale!","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
25,alicenguyenz,Miss Korea,3.0,Average food at expensive prices - not authentic Korean food,"If you truly want to get a taste of what authentic Korean food taste like, I would not recommend Miss Korea.

Average food at the expensive prices. I praise for the menu tho as it has a good variety of choices between side dishes, chicken, seafood, beef etc. I believe the most proud dish of the restaurant of the BBQ, however I personally think the dish is over priced for the under seasoning meat, little proportion on the dish.

Nevertheless, I do recommend to order Tteokbokki ( Korean rice cake) and the rice dishes as they are quite delicious and easy to eat.",['samgyeopsal'],1
26,Andythebaggie,Miss Korea,4.0,Decent and good value Korean BBQ,"Popped in on spec during Chinese New Year celebrations, so there was a bit of a wait for a table. We do enjoy Korean bbq, first we ordered vegetable Goyza whilst waiting for the bbq to warm up. We then had a selection of dishes, beef in beer, chicken, mushrooms, spuds etc along with lettuce, rice and chilli and garlic for me to give the meal an extra kick. The dishes did come out rather haphazardly, indeed the potatoes which took the longest to cook came out last. House wine is great value at around £13 a bottle, there’s beer to inc. Hite if you want something Korean. Service is slightly random, though tbf it was very busy when we arrived. Food is good though, and overall we certainly enjoyed our meal. And at £50 excl service it’s good value. Btw it’s cash only here (plenty of cash points nearby).",['samgyeopsal'],1
27,xlavayukix,Miss Korea,4.0,Flavorful and authentic Korean food,"I came here twice so far and love the food, Miss Korea is a real authentic Korean restaurant with BBQ plates on the table and a huge menu of everything from kimchi pancakes, bibimbap and a variety of jigae to BBQ meat and seafood, grilled and fried dishes plus a full vegetarian menu. The quality of food here is excellent and they’re kimchi is the best I’ve ever had in terms of UK Korean restaurants, the portions are big and the prices are cheap; mains are around £8-9, starters are around £5 each. The service is basic at best, the staff are efficient but not too attentive. They also do not accept card so it’s cash only, which is a downside. I loved the seafood bibimbap and spicy tofu jigae, both tasted divine. Overall high quality flavorful and authentic Korean food, cheap prices, generous portions but average service.",['samgyeopsal'],1

31,910minhh,Miss Korea,5.0,Exceptional food excellent service,"Having been to many korean restaurants in the UK (mainly London), I can say without a doubt that this one is the best for food, service is good and the setting is nice. Value wise they give generous portions. Definitley worth a visit if you're in Birmingham. It is situated just on the outskirts of chinatown.",['samgyeopsal'],1

35,Dave G,Miss Korea,3.0,Double Edged Sword,"So, rocked up here last night with family and friends for my birthday.

Me - ""Hi, have a table booked for 8 at 7""

Them - ""errrrr....?""

That was kind of the way the rest of the night went.

Drinks order took over 20 mins to arrive.

Waitress to order the food took as long again to come over.

Then better part of an hour wait for anything.

My meal came, out, everyone else got left waiting. Had to go up twice to chase up everyone elses food. Must have been at least another 20 mins before some of theirs came. I had long finished before the 2 katsu curerys came at the end.

Ill give them their dues, they were very apologetic and threw in a couple of rounds of drinks and some food to try and appease things, which softened the blow a little.

The food though, was really really good. Bitter sweet really. Bursting with flavours, cooked to perfection and well presented. No one had anything other than beaming smiles they tucked in and it was clean plates all round. Not a bad word to say about that.

Just a shame that the service was soooo bad. If you dont mind spending 4hrs in a restaurant feeling like no one cares about your experience, the food is .ore than worth it xx",['samgyeopsal'],0
36,pringlePlymouth,Miss Korea,1.0,"Terrible service, cold food, long wait for food.","We have never tried Korean food so were looking forward to tasting something different.
We were greated and seated quickly and then informed they only accept cash, i wonder why that is??
The service was terrible, staff who couldn't care less. The food came out in dribs and srabs over 15 minutes. Mains first and then 15 mins later the rice. Useless.
I wouldn't recommend Miss Korea ever.",['samgyeopsal'],0
37,pang l,Miss Korea,5.0,korean food,I really enjoyed this place. I went there with my Korean friend. Totally affordable and genuine food. Relaxed atmosphere! We spent £28 in total,['samgyeopsal'],1
38,The-Midlander,Miss Korea,4.0,Decent Addition to Birmingham’s Asian Quarter,"Decent Korean food. Service is ok - seems like a fairly new restauranteur team, so some of the sequencing was a bit off.
For example we ordered 2 starters, but one came after we’d started the main course, so we sent it back. And my wife’s main course came a few minutes after mine, which we had to flag.
However the team of waitresses were well dressed, and couldn’t do enough to help once they had realised their mistake.
So overall, decent food, a friendly restaurant team. They just need to improve some of their sequencing.
Overall Miss Korea is a good edition to Birmingham’s burgeoning Asian restaurant quarter.",['samgyeopsal'],1
39,Sophia7758,Miss Korea,5.0,Amazing food and great customer service,"Went to Miss Korea with my friend today. We had BBQ between two of us.

44,Toni M,Miss Korea,2.0,Do yourself a favour and go over to Topokki instead,"Massively underwhelmed with this place. Very few bbqs actually worked, the food was honestly slightly dodgy ( although their veggie kimchi pancake and tofu were lovely but then again quite expensive for what they were ), the staff were rude and slow (only two tables were busy), and you cant pay with card. I had a really hot soup which was served with a metal spoon and burnt my tongue massively.",['samgyeopsal'],0

46,ningl2019,Miss Korea,1.0,SO RUDE SERVICE,"”YOU GUYS ARE STUPID” THAT IS WHAT YOU SAID!!!!!
I had heard excellent things about this place but the experience I had today was the complete opposite!!! First of all, the one waitress at the place was absolutely rude, she had the worst scowl on her face and had kept pinning everything she did wrong on somebody who had little English skills as we had previously mentioned to the woman. She had ‘misheard’ one of the orders (which to me when she was taking the orders looked like she didn’t give a flying toss). When we explained she got the order wrong she gave us the dirtiest look and told us we were wrong and spent 30 minutes trying to get us to eat something we did not order and when we finally received what we had originally ordered it was once again not the right food! We had pointed specifically to braised chicken bulgogi with bbq sauce which we pointed at the photo which we revived a dish which we did not order. After finishing the food we received the bill and split it between 7 of us and 2 of the girls left shortly after. As soon as the girls had left the waitresses came over to tell us that they messed the bill up and it went from £78 to £85 which I must say we are 15 and some of us do not have a lot of money and would have helped if they could have told us before the girls had left. So overall I will not be re visiting and I do not recommend going there!!!",['samgyeopsal'],0
47,dk092014,Miss Korea,2.0,Poor experience,"The food was slightly below average. The service is as bad as it can get. It's a wonder how they are still open but then again it's cash only.. so maybe someone is forgetting to declare their taxes.

48,NickSFCB,Miss Korea,4.0,Excellent Korean food,"We ate in here for the 1st time on a Monday night. The restaurant was very busy and has a great ambiance. The servers were all friendly and the food is excellent. to start with we had the chicken Kangpopi, which was larger enough to have been a main course. The sauce was very good, not too spicy, but had enough flavour. For my main course, I had the Chicken katsu. Again this was very good, the chicken was well cooked and the curry sauce was great, the sticky rice was also brilliant. My wife had a beef dish. Which she enjoyed and was well cooked. This was my first visit to Miss Korea and will not be my last.
For a starter, 2 mains a soft drink and 1 glass of wine, the total was £34, which is excellent value.",['samgyeopsal'],1
49,Xela_02_87,Miss Korea,4.0,Lovely meal,"Good was lovely. Drinks were served quickly. Food not so quickly. Waitress service wasn't the best, seemingly too rushed off their feet to be too friendly or offer any menu guidance etc. We have eaten korean bbq before but they should really assume that and should take the time to offer to assist new clientele. We ordered squid beef and spicy pork with sides for the bbq. Everything was lovely and fresh. Staff were attentive at keeping an eye on bbq temperature and replacing the grease proof paper laid over the bbq though. I would recommend but maybe not for ppl trying korean for the first time.",['samgyeopsal'],1
50,RekhaC61,Miss Korea,3.0,Different,Went with my husband and 13 year old son. It was a good pleasant atmosphere. Service a bit slow as low on waiting staff. Steak was very good. Ox tongue and belly pork was not pleasant. Chicken was average.,['samgyeopsal'],0
51,glynb326,Miss Korea,3.0,Popular with large groups,"I’ve been there with friends 3 times and trust their advice on what to eat as menu is complex and difficult to use. The food is tasty and there is certainly no rush to take orders, deliver food and drink and to bring the bill. On each occasion, there have been lots of Chinese and/or Korean customers so this must mean they’re doing something right. Remember to take cash as they don’t accept card payments.",['samgyeopsal'],1

This was our second visit and both times it was outstanding. Everything we had was fresh, the staff were very helpful and polite. I would highly recommend this restaurant if your willing to have a go at cooking some things yourself, it’s fun, and a must try for anyone who likes something different. For people who don’t want the BBQ there’s enough choice on the menu. Reasonably priced too. Excellent. Can’t wait to come back",['samgyeopsal'],1
54,Jes1000jes,Miss Korea,1.0,"Disappointing experience, awful service","Went to try this restaurant the very first time but they successfully made us not to return. The Cash Only restaurant which you will be told when you sit down and of course again and again afterward. It was quick when order the food but long waiting time after that - you need to be patience and not too hungry so keep chatting or bring a book. Food was a bit disappointed. Frozen meat was served for BBQ - maybe it is ok??

Vegetables were not fresh. Food portion is small. We ordered a Kimchi fire rice as we love kimchi but it was so hard to dig out some kimchi and can hardly see the pork. Service was awful - all waitresses may had a super hard day. One of them turned off our BBQ cooker suddenly without even said a word when we still have meats on there.

Not a good experience, very disappointed.",['samgyeopsal'],0
55,N8167AUrichardp,Miss Korea,2.0,"Terrible service, average Korean food","I was excited to try this place for the Korean BBQ having wandered past a few weeks before. The welcome we received should have given some warning signs of the experience we’d receive - on arrival it took five minutes for the staff to acknowledge us. At which point we were asked to wait for a table. This was fine - however we then sat for 30 minutes before being shown to a table which was vacant when we had arrived half an hour prior.

We’d browsed the menu whilst waiting so were ready to order, but had to wait another 20 minutes to place our order - successive staff members telling us there was only one member of staff ‘who could take orders’. Whilst ordering we were then informed that the restaurant was cash only, so I had to wander to the local Tesco to get enough cash to cover the meal. A 20 minute wait at a busy cashpoint was not ideal but made little difference as our food took a good 45 minutes to arrive anyway.

I love a seafood pajeon (pancake) - this was the first of our order served, the Miss Korea version was unusually heavy and relatively tasteless. A disappointing start. Our bbq options then arrived - this was better, a good portion of pork belly which we struggled to finish. The experience however was affected again by the service. A surly member of staff repeatedly messing with the temperature controls without explanation and removing all food on the bbq to a plate again without explanation (it turns out to replace the grease proof paper on the grill). We also had to ask at least five times to have a glass of tap water delivered to the table - it eventually arriving at the end of the meal.

Overall a very disappointing experience, I don’t think we’ll be back - the food a pale imitation of decent Korean cuisine and some of the worst service I’ve received for a while.",['samgyeopsal'],0
56,Flyer53864362401,Miss Korea,1.0,Would’ve been to korea and back in the time we waited,It took 45 minutes for them to serve us. Never coming back. Food quality didn’t make up for the wait either.,['samgyeopsal'],0
57,Rennie H,Miss Korea,5.0,Loving it,"Amazing service. The waiters were absolutely lovely. It looked great and the dishes were really tasty. The Kimchi pancake was the best I have ever tried. We also enjoyed the tteokbokki and the bulgoki. The bibimbap was slightly disappointing, but the overall experience was brilliant. Also, nice music.",['samgyeopsal'],1

60,Passport813659,Miss Korea,2.0,Disappointed...,"I'm a korean, but I wasn't able to feel korean food in this restaurant. I think the owner is a chines, so the taste towards more on chines style than original korean. I had soybean paste stew and Bibimbab. The stew was so salty and less ingredient, I think if they put more tofu or other vegetables in the stew, it would be better. And my friend said the Bibimbab has to much rice and less vegetables and meats. Maybe, I can make better dishes than this restaurant. Also, I don't know why they are only available cash. I had to withdraw money from near ATM...

버밍엄에 한식당이 많이 없어서 기대 했는데 종업원들도 중국인이고, 한식을 잘하는 식당은 아닌것 같습니다. 된장찌개가 짠맛밖에 없어요. 비빔밥은 찌개보다 먹을만한데 같이 간 친구는 밥을 정말 많이 남겼어요.",['samgyeopsal'],1

65,zelvmarcelo,Miss Korea,3.0,Foods are nice but service needs improvement,"I’ve always eaten here because I like the ambience of the restaurant. It looks way better than typical restaurant in most China town. I’ve also always loved eating Korean foods so no matter which restaurant I order it from I’m still gonna like it. However, the staff needs more training as they all seemed to be young student girls with no experience in customer service. Once you have your food on your table they don’t ask you anymore whether everything is okay or not. One time I had to call the attention of the waitress for 3 times and she still didn’t come to our table because they were busy (showed they were short of staff too and can’t handle busy shifts). I saw the manager (I assume she is) lowkey telling off the waitress when she didn’t know the name of the food she was serving. There were times too when the food order took so long to arrive on the table and not at the same time. They’ll bring one after the other! (Again, it showed slow service from the kitchen). Like I said I love Korean foods but the service in this restaurant needs improvement. Oh, i was surprised when i saw that they charge you for service charge when you don’t get the service you deserve to get anyway.",['samgyeopsal'],1
66,DayTrip760172,Miss Korea,1.0,No go,"Was taken for a mother's day meal. What a meal if was we waited at least after hour before being dealt with. Was told we would need to pay by cash despite seeing others pay with card. We ordered drinks before my daughter went to the cash point I waited and the staff served the other familes arounf us despite us being seated first, did not want to bring the drinks out until she was back it was across the road in view of the restaurant. The food it's self over cooked tough, under seasoned and plain tasting. Was not enjoyable at all. The service was appalling it was like we was a burden to them the it was a shambles out starters we were brought one starter out of 3 and it took another 25mins before it was received. We had our mains before our starter arrived. Ended up just paying for what was ordered and leaving. Still hungry, disappointed.",['samgyeopsal'],0

68,zoegreviews,Miss Korea,4.0,"Reasonable, if a little Anglicised","Tucked in a corner of Chinatown, this little slice of Korea was almost empty when we arrived at 12:15. The waitress was swift to warn us that they were cash only but luckily there was a cash point in the Tesco express just up the road.

By 12:45, the place had filled with chatter; even the large banquet table down the middle was full. Reassuringly, the majority of diners were Korean and we were only 1 of two tables with Westerners on it. The menu was all in English and the waitresses were quick to take our orders and very helpful.

We ordered samgyupsal(belly pork) bbq, soy bean soup and kimchijeon (kimchi pancake). The kimchijeon came first, unusually it seemed to have been deep-fat fried and so had a slightly crisp coating but still tasted quite good. The soy bean soup was good though a little low on chillies. The samgyupsal was somewhat disappointing - rather than the thick meaty strips of the home country, this was more reminiscent of bacon; thin and overly fatty. Despite that, it was an enjoyable meal, coming to £32.00 for the three dishes plus sides and drinks. Is certainly go back to see how the other food compares!",['samgyeopsal'],1
69,Lelly61,Miss Korea,3.0,First visit.,"Visited today with family, Attended Chinese New year celebrations. Short wait for table. One member of staff very helpful. Not had Korean food before.

73,SairaBe,Miss Korea,3.0,Mixed feelings,"Reception was okay and they were very helpful. Not sure if this was because it was a Sunday but I am old and experienced enough to know my good was heated and not cooked fresh. My husband had a bibimbap which looked fresh and maybe should have ordered that.
Was recommended miss Korea by a colleague and this place is nothing to write home about. Sorry!",['samgyeopsal'],0
74,Salma-Ben,Miss Korea,4.0,Very good,"The food was fresh, good value and really tasty. The restaurant is on the edge of China Town. It is clean, tidy and pleasant. Waitress was friendly, polite and attentive. It has a car park directly opposite.",['samgyeopsal'],1

76,Natty P,Miss Korea,4.0,Satisfying and delicious!,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday and had a great meal. Between the two of us we tried the pork gyozas, and basically had the BBQ. We chose the beer lamb, BBQ beef and the beef ribs. All very tender once on the BBQ, the ribs were a bit chewy though. Our bill came to around £40 and included two bowls of rice and some soft drinks. Overall, highly recommended if you're a beginner to Korean food. The only downside is that the ventilation isn't great so you do end up smelling like your food!",['samgyeopsal'],1
77,drcmlin,Miss Korea,1.0,Poor service,"Poor service, staff cannot manage. Waited a long time to order in spite of calling out to staff. Apparently there is only one staff who can take order.

Needless to say we walked out. There are other Korean places to eat in Birmingham. Avoid.",['samgyeopsal'],0
78,EstherZeng,Miss Korea,3.0,Restaurant with mixed blessing,Their pork BBQs are tender and delicious. But I really don't like the fact that we have to order extra for lettuces because lettuces are complimentary for Korean BBQ in most restaurants I have visited. Side dishes have to order separately and not free. Kimchi soup came with complimentary rice bowl though. The taste of other foods are quite okay but not as good as the one I went at Manchester. The decoration is nice and the staff is friendly. Only cash is accepted.,['samgyeopsal'],0

81,busymum001,Miss Korea,4.0,Nice for a change,We wanted to go somewhere different as a family for Father's Day lunch and a friend recommended here. I always read reviews beforehand and so we knew about the cash situation and that service tended to be slow. We got there when it opened at noon and so service was not at all slow. We were the only customers for a while. It gave us time to ask lots of questions about the food and the numerous options. Two of us chose the cook yourself BBQ option and two had terryaki dishes. The beef terryaki was delicious and it was a novelty to cook on the grill. The rest of the food was good verging on ok. We didn't appreciate the additional 'tax' added onto the bill but had been very happy with our young waitress and the service she provided. Probably won't rush back but wouldn't rule it out either,['samgyeopsal'],0
82,Junehope,Miss Korea,1.0,Disappointed and pricey !!!!,"Accept cash only, long waiting time, pricey compared to other Korean restaurant nearby , no ventilation at the shop
Bad customer service, we asked whether we could change our seating area cause the sun keep facing at my seating area. Been refused and no apologies.

We were so disappointed with this simple request as there were still plenty of seating table available at that time. We have to end up take away all our foods and went to somewhere else to have our dinner!!!

Would not recommend and would not ever go there again!!!",['samgyeopsal'],0
83,Tomandli,Miss Korea,4.0,Different cuisine to try!,"Me and a friend were feeling adventurous in trying out a new cuisine. We passed Miss Korea as an off chance. Thought we would try it. First up was the Korean tea...............very much an acquired taste too 'woody' for me. We ordered an appetizer to share (Belly Pork with Kimchi) which was rather a large dish. I felt it would have been better served with rice or noodles as it had a rich salty/ spicy taste to eat alone. The main courses were chicken Bibimbap and Seafood Udon Noodles. Both dishes were very tasty and filling. The bibimbap was an unusual dish as it is a very hot stone/ clay pot with rice at the bottom topped by vegetables and meat of your choice then a raw egg. The idea is to mix it all together before you eat it. Almost as if you are stir frying the dish!

Our waitress was very helpful and informative about the dishes we asked about. The downside was CASH only which we did not know until we asked for the bill.",['samgyeopsal'],1
84,Elmo1989_03,Miss Korea,5.0,Yummy,Korean food seems to becoming more and more fashionable these days. I especially like how there are so many vegetarian/vegan options on offer at this restaurant and it was very clean and comfortable. The toilets are fun - a cat meows whenever you open the door! This type of quirkiness is what makes South East Asia so fascinating. My tofu was fantastic and just spicy enough. Staff were so cute and smiley too. We were the only white people in there which is a testament to how authentic this place is. We would definitely return the next time we are in Birmingham especially as the Hippodrome theatre is down the road.,['samgyeopsal'],1
85,leroyy541,Miss Korea,5.0,Korean food is the most unrated Asian food in Asia,"I been coming to Miss Korea restaurant since late 2013 and every single time that I come here the food is consistent the standards are high the staff is friendly as well as helpful, there isn't much korean restaurants in Birmingham England this is a treat who want to try something different other than Chinese Japanese Indian or Thai food korean kimchi stew is very healthy kimchi itself is one of the healthiest foods on earth it based on fermentation of different vegetables the most popular one is with cabbage.",['samgyeopsal'],1
86,LVCICI,Miss Korea,5.0,Birthday,Celebrated my birthday here. There was 20 of us. Seated just fine. Only one lady server initially then the second lady came after an hour. Fantastic service and food is served excellently. Will definitely come back again. Price is a bit high but went with great satisfaction.,['samgyeopsal'],1
87,CIsip,Miss Korea,1.0,I'd rate it zero if I could,"Bad food, even worse service. They only take cash due to evading tax probably. Ordered a lamb meal and it tasted gross. I barely touched it so I complained to the waitress and she could not speak much English and apologised but kept checking with the owner what they could do and all they could offer was 15% off our bill which is a complete rip off as my food arrived 30 mins after my friend has had his food. No apologies about this whatsoever. After a while, the owner came out very rude and arrogant saying they do not care if we don't like the taste of the food as to them it tastes okay. They tasted my leftovers as well. Wtf. Horrible experience. I will not be coming back ever. Probably will put a formal complaint as well after how we were treated.",['samgyeopsal'],0
88,FoodyReviewer,Miss Korea,3.0,Great if you have these expectations...,"1) lots of people seated = extremely slow service. It isn't bad, it is just slow. Once seated, wait 5-10 minutes for drinks order. Wait for drinks 5-10 minutes. Another 15-20 minutes wait for food order. Raw/BBQ yourself orders, will obviously get theirs quicker. Possibly another 25-30 minutes additional wait for the cooked food. We opted for all cooked, so first 2 people ate theirs whilst other 2 watched, once finished, still a wait before the other 2 people were even served.

2) food was tasty and portions we thought were good

3) cash only

4) there are separate booths and tables for 4, the row of tables down the centre all squeezed together, so you may be next to strangers. The seats are comfy and the atmosphere is lively, and you will likely be socialising with your own company anyway

5) you/your clothes/coats will come out smelling of BBQ/oil/grease/chilli etc. The vents up above in the ceiling might not be doing anything useful at all

Would recommend going if you have lots of time, want to try different flavours on your palate and/want a different experience of cooking whilst socialising and eating.

Next time we come, we'll choose our clothes wisely.",['samgyeopsal'],1
89,hanguyen2,Miss Korea,4.0,Good food but a bit pricey,Don't understand the 10% tax or I think it's a tip added because they accept cash only :). The food is in small portion so need to order loads.,['samgyeopsal'],0
90,TylerDurdan,Miss Korea,4.0,Solid Korean and good fun,"Had a good night here with the family. Kimchi was spicy and delicious. On the BBQ the spicy pork was our favourite. Soups had lots of flavour. Prices were fine, not cheap but no big shock when bill arrived. Negatives; there is no extraction system so the place is full of bbq smoke, clothes will smell after; and like other reviewers noted the service charge is hidden. It is put on the bill as tax rather than service and the waitresses are vague when ask them if service is already included or not. It is.",['samgyeopsal'],0
91,PaulLondon1985,Miss Korea,4.0,"Very tasty, quick service","Had a lovely bowl of bibbimap, full of flavour. Excellent starters too. Quick efficient service. We did come out smelling of oil though!

92,UUKKYY,Miss Korea,2.0,Not really Korean food,"Food were small portions and the price were expensive. The waitress said they only receive cash after I have placed an order, so my friend had to go to the cash machine.

The toilet light was very dark.",['samgyeopsal'],0
93,Bhanudhir,Miss Korea,4.0,Even better than last time,"This was my first visit for quite a while and since it has been refurbished. Mid evening on a Friday night we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The new grills seemed easy to use and the waitress fired it up as soon as we ordered. We piled in with beef, prawns, omelette, seafood tempura and kimchi. It was great watching our prawns and beef griddle while we supped on beer and Korean tea (which has overtones of vanilla). We got lettuce with the beef (which made it great to make beef, barbecue sauce and kimchi parcels). The omelette/pancake was every bit as good as I had hoped after seeing Judy Joo make one on a TV programme. The prawn, fish and vegetable tempura were delicious, crispy with firm flesh and even better when dipped in soy sauce. The kimchi.was really fiery. There was far too much to eat but they kindly boxed the leftovers for us. The waitresses are friendly and efficient. It surprises me that so few brummies visit this place: most of the clientele were oriental. The food is delicious and £56 was not too bad considering how much we ordered. With parking just across the road I don't know why you haven't visited. Highly recommended.",['samgyeopsal'],1

97,nandasmm,Miss Korea,3.0,Offers reasonable prices but service was slow and the food was not exceptional...bear in mind they add 10% TAX to bill,"We visited this place one year ago and left unimpressed then. This time we arrived as a group of four for our meal and after ordering our food, service initially started very well. We got our drinks and the dishes started to arrive but after some time we were ignored. Our requests for drinks were ignored and after the first 3-4 dishes we ordered we had to wait 15-20 mins for the remainder of the dishes to arrive. It was then we noticed that the place wasn't that busy but they were serving dishes to the other tables that had arrived after us. The BBQ and seafood pancake was delicious and the bibimbap and teriyaki eel was passable. But the worst of all was the soft tofu stew. It was nothing like we had ever tried before. It was lacking in flavour and was more like a clear soup with bits of tofu, cucumber and one egg in it. At the end, when we asked for the bill we were also slapped with a 10% TAX at the end for poor service. We didn't complain but this is one place we will definitely not be coming back to.

Keep in mind, this place serves BBQ but has no ventilation system installed so it also becomes very stuffy and smoky. You will definitely leave the place smelling of BBQ and smoke.",['samgyeopsal'],0
98,N_pham90,Miss Korea,3.0,Overrated,"Heard about this place quite a while ago and I've heard good reviews so decided to take a visit with the family. Not much of a big place and the food was okay. Quite overrated. Service took a while. Mains came before the starters? And even when we've finished our mains the starters still hasn't come out. They forgot our orders and the staff seemed disorientated. Some of the bbq meat were good and the rest were taste less. Seafood platter was okay. Fresh. The potato, pumpkin veg platter came out after we had the meat and seafood platter so we sat there eating grilled veg. The spicy fried chicken was really good and the decor of the restaurant is pretty but apart from that it was mediocre.",['samgyeopsal'],1
99,stevewstour,Miss Korea,4.0,Typically good for the Chinese quarter,"I don't get why some of this cluster of restaurants can be so empty on a Saturday night while others are brimmed. Anyway, this place is in the latter category and it's easy to see why. I've never been to Korea so I can't vouch for the authenticity, but it's well worth a visit. The staff are very helpful and happy to walk you around the dishes. This is quite useful as some of the dishes a either quite spicy or served raw. They're also happy to anglosise a dish for you too, if what they're serving is a bit weird for you. Every table is equipped with a barbecue grill too, and this looks fun. I'm not sure where some of the ""expensive"" reviews come from on TA. 34 quid for 2 people with sides, drinks and starters is pretty good (what do you want for your money??) and the service was excellent, especially for a busy Saturday night. Cash only!",['samgyeopsal'],1

The food at Miss Korea is delicious very healthy for the first time I tried cold buckwheat noodles and it was very nice, the old saying is don't knock it until you tried.

She claimed herself as Manager which I don't believe she is and I openly said to her ""well you obviously failed your life and will stuck here forever! ""

All the tables were full so we were asked to wait at a table and given menus. The service was ok and the food was nice but there were a lot of people barbecuing and the atmosphere got thicker and thicker.

Lovely place,, could do a better in service.We were not even asked how our food was in the entire meal sessioin, but still charged extra as a service charge or don't know what, it only said tax.. but if you charge extra for the service, you have to up your game in sevice, I felt so.

The restaurant itself is not the poshest in the world, and if you're looking for intimacy then it's not really the place for you, but it is nicely decorated, the seats are comfortable and there's a friendly hubbub atmosphere. The waiting staff were friendly and accommodating, there was a wait for food but it was explained to us before we ordered so we didn't mind too much.
The food itself was tasty - we shared dumplings and edamame to start, then had black bean pork and noodles and bibimbap with a side of bean sprouts for main. It was tasty. With the exception of the bibimbap which came in it's own hot bowl, the food wasn't as hot as I would expect - but that's not to say it was unpleasant. (A lot of the menu is meat which you have to cook yourself on a built in grill on the table so I guess if you ordered that then your food would be super hot)
The reason the review is 4* and not 5* is that at the back of the restaurant there is some kind of function room or bar area, which generated a lot of loud noise throughout our dining experience, also, where we were sat was directly opposite the door and every time anyone went in or out the door stays open so we were repeatedly having to ask for the door to be closed as it was really cold. I understand the weather can't be helped and there are limited seats, we hadn't booked, so our table was probably one of the worst positions and if we had only had to ask once for the door to be closed I wouldn't mention it - it was the fact that even though the staff knew we were cold when the door was open and were stood and could clearly see (and feel) the door was open, they waited for us to ask before they closed it.
Overall though, a good experience.",['samgyeopsal'],1
112,Brum303,Miss Korea,3.0,Good food and a little bit different,"Celebrating a friends birthday so a small group. Keen to try something new we went for a set menu consisting of starters and main followed by ice cream. Starters was soup followed by something similar to dim sum. This was lovely and there was plenty of it. Then came main course which consists of various meats, vegetables and sauces which you cook for yourself using the hot plate in the centre of the table - think fondue style. Bit of a novelty factor which soon wore off as I eat out for someone to cook for me! Good to try/experience but if I went again I'd get something else. All of the food was lovely though.",['samgyeopsal'],1

114,reid1874,Miss Korea,1.0,avoid this place,"i gave this place a try as the other Korean restaurant 'Toppokki' across the road in china town seemed too busy. The food was absolute garbage from the frozen breaded prawn starters to a kimchi stew which tasted hideous, I felt like i could taste tomato ketchup in the soup. The service was pretty appalling, had to go out of my way to get the attention of the waitress who was frowning the entire evening. No authenticity, horrible tasteless bland food which is nothing like Korean home cooked food, poor service. If only I could give zero ratings.",['samgyeopsal'],0
115,CynicallyOptimistic,Miss Korea,1.0,What a let down for Korean dining,"In a nutshell:

Food and soups were all plain and bland.
Staff were not the friendliest.
Restaurant suits couples and large groups, I would encourage a family dining here.
Ventilation is a major issue in that place.
Price is not relative to the food quality nor dining experience.

Very disappointed and will probably stick to Topokki, that's just round the corner on Hurst St (check out my review on them too).

Wouldn't recommend at all.",['samgyeopsal'],0

117,Susannah G,Miss Korea,2.0,Good food but poor ventilation and extraction,"This has been a good place for tasty food and I have visited it on a number of occasions in the past. However, of late there is something wrong with their ventilation, which really affects the dining experience and what comes after it.

After a busy week I thought I'd take the evening off and eat out to save time and work, but ended up having to throw all of my clothes, including my coat and my backpack, into the wash. I left the restaurant smelling very strongly of food due to the lack of air circulation and extraction. Also, the floor tiles were so slippery that I nearly fell over, which says something as I was wearing sensible shoes with non-slip Vibram soles. Other customers were similarly shuffling and sliding along in their sneakers to avoid slipping.

Overall good food, but not a relaxing experience and it created far more work than if I had stayed at home and cooked for myself.",['samgyeopsal'],1
118,qetuos,Miss Korea,5.0,Still CASH ONLY,"Have been there for several times and really love the food. Be ready to wait for the food because it took ages for the food to come (except barbecue).

It has been a year since its reopening but they still accept cash only!!! This is very annoying because they used the same ""excuse"" every time which was that ""there is a problem with the card machine connection to the server at the moment ""!!! Come on! I've been to the restaurant around 10 times since their reopening last year and they explained the Cash Only thing with the same excuse every time!!

How could a card machine out of order for more than one year!? Because they never actually use the card machine!! Perhaps they're lying because of some particular reasons.

However, the food is good. Hope it would accept card payments as soon as possible.",['samgyeopsal'],1
119,Sun K,Miss Korea,1.0,Anniversary Meal Totally Ruined,"I took my family last Friday evening for my anniversary meal - something different I thought because we always go to Cafe Soya which I must say is excellent. All started off well, waitress was friendly & explained the different meals. We ordered & then we waited 35 minutes for drinks & then our meals came 1 after the other - my wife's first after 50 minutes them mine 10 minutes later & my children then waited a further 10 minutes for their meals. It's not as if we ordered anything out of the ordinary. It's was very annoying knowing my children were hungry & me & my wife had our meals eventually but they still hadn't had theirs. The waitress said there was a mix up with the order which I couldn't understand because everything was from their menu & numbered. How easy could it be - the place wasn't busy so there was no excuse at all & the apologising during our meal got very irritating - too cap it off the waitress apologised again & then said they wouldn't charge the 10 % service charge. We couldn't wait too get out of there & would never return - the food is okay, the portions are mediocre & the prices are expensive for what it is but I will emphasise I will keep to what I know & stick ' Cafe Soya' in the future",['samgyeopsal'],0

124,Mr_Jutla,Miss Korea,5.0,Smokier than Chinese,"First time I've had a Korean meal, came across this place on TripAdvisor and read the reviews as protocol. The place was only 30metres from where I was so took a look with my own eyes. When it comes to eating out, the number one thing that friends ask me is, ""where can I get good Indian food?"" (I'm of Indian origin) and my answer is always the same, ""wherever you see Indian people eating"". I followed my own advice and opted to dine at Miss Korea as this is where Koreans were eating. They have the raw menu where you can cook your own meat on the built in grill on your table, like a self serve teppan yaki but my friends and I opted for the cooked choices. We enjoyed a smokey chicken teriyaki sizzling on the iron plate, the sweet and spicy chicken, veg noodles and the some of the crispiest tempura in a light and fresh batter. Sides of cucumber relish and kimchi. To not cloud the flavour we stuck with water as it was our first experience of Korean cuisine. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal and at the end we took guesses as to the bill, it came in under a third under our estimates! Full of flavour and excellent value, goes to show you have to try things and make your own opinions.",['samgyeopsal'],1

127,KRPT,Miss Korea,4.0,Very nice meal but do go prepared.,"We had high hopes and expectation for the place and it did not disappoint us at all. The flavours were good and we loved the BBQ dishes we have been craving for. We ordered a portion of the raw beef (Yuk Hwae) and wow! Thanks to other reviewers, we were dressed prepared for the smoky BBQ environment and had we not been warned, we would have been pretty annoyed if we had turned up in our Sunday best only to find we needed to literally strip as we walked into our home and everything went into the wash and bodies in the shower! However, if you are prepared, it really is worth it. The only criticism is the ""excuse"" of the card machine being ""still"" out of order, we wondered if it had ever worked. We thought it would have given a better impression to simply state cash only up front as it would not deter us from eating there again at all. The food itself is enough to draw in customers.",['samgyeopsal'],1

First thing .... The food is a bit pricey.... If you want the grill..... It can be a bit expensive... Korea food seems to be a growing trend nowadays. ... but not really for me.....

Food is okay and will not blow you mind.....

132,Zoe_Gabrielle,Miss Korea,1.0,A very disappointing 1st visit after some recommendations!,"Today, I was craving for Korean food for lunch. And so, after my friend's recommendation and all the positive reviews, I've decided to hive Miss Korea a try. It was the only reason why I went to the city centre today and I was excited.

Upon entering the restaurant, I've noticed the nice yet simple decor. I find it very cosy. I was greeted with a ""hello"" by the waitress, I sat and checked on the menu that looks sumptuous. I was very hungry I couldn't wait to order and feast.

It took quite a few minutes before my order was taken even though it was quiet today. I've ordered for kimchi, jap chae and beef Bulgogi bibimbap. Come the drinks, I asked for korean tea. However I was told that their bar is closed. Ok, I opt for Sprite with loads of ice. But then, I was told they have no ice! At this point,miss a starting to feel a bit annoyed. Alright then, I can do without ice.

I stood up to go to the toilet and the waitress had another news for me. There is no light in the toilet and even said that if I want, I can use my mobile phone as a light! How unacceptable! By this time, I've already lost my appetite. Closed bar, no ice then no
light in the toilet. To top it all, I was told they only accept cash payment as their card machine is broken! What an appalling service I got today. That broken card machine has been their issue for quite some time now! Does it really take long to fix it? I've told the waitress that it has been terrible experience I've had with them today.

And since my appetite has already been spoilt, I left the restaurant without tasting their food. I'm not even sure if I would come back to try it. I was very disappointed. And quite frankly, I don't care if a restaurant's food is good, if the service is bad then I shall never go back nor will I recommend it to any of my friends.

I ended up in Toppoki which is just on the other side and I've enjoyed their food very much.",['samgyeopsal'],0

So far, this is the best restaurant that I have found serving this dish. I have been a few times over the last few years and have never been disappointed.

141,680amitm,Miss Korea,5.0,Fascinating,"Having eaten Korean before, on a visit to Hong Kong. I knew roughly what to expect.

142,smjohns,Miss Korea,1.0,Wish I had tried the food!!,"Had heard great things about this place and the menu had us drooling. When we arrived the staff were welcoming and there was a nice buzz to the place. We ordered a drink whilst we waited for our pals but by the time they had joined us and finished their drink too, we had to leave. Unfortunately we were overwhelmed by the odour.

The problem is that this place is Korean BBQ, so you cook your own food at the table. Sounds like a great idea but not when there is little or no ventilation. We were there for less than 30mins but our clothes stank of fried food / oil for the rest of the night.

Considering this is a fairly new venue, it is not going to smell any better with time, especially with the wood paneling and cloth covered chairs. A commercial kitchen is not allowed to open without proper ventilation so I have no idea how this place remains open without the same in the dining room.

Such a shame !!",['samgyeopsal'],0
143,BarrySiddick,Miss Korea,5.0,So delicious!!!,I love Korean food so much and Korean BBQ in particular. We went here a little tipsy and left more that satisfied.

145,266timothyp,Miss Korea,4.0,Authentic Korean Dining in Nottingham,"This new restaurant provides to my mind authentic Korean flavours and dining experiences. I am no expert but have a little knowledge of Korean food having visited the country about 20 times. I was told that the chef is Korean and this was borne out in the flavours I enjoyed in my lunchtime Bulgogi Bibimpap a few days ago.

The melon juice was typical of the kinds of accompaniment one enjoys with Korean food, and the kimchee (pickled spicy cabbage) really did take me back to a country I have enjoyed visiting over many years.

The restaurant was very quiet when we viisted but this was just before the start of the university terms in Nottingham. Nottingham's 60,000 new and returning students (or at any rate some of them) no doubt will give the place a bit of atmosphere shortly.

There was only one (non-Korean) waitress serving when we visited, but this no doubt reflects the fact that we were there at lunchtime, at a quiet time of the week. I would say however that the confident manner in which Korean waiters and waitresses serve and talk about the food it is their job to bring to you is another very nice aspect of restaurants in Korea. If this place can manage it it should hire some Korean waiting staff it would provide even more genuineness in the dining experience.

The only thing I really quibble however with is the name of the restaurant. Viewed either as referring to a yearning for visiting Korea or to a beauty pageant, it is slightly cheesy. Something that speaks to you of Korea's ancient culture in my view would be more appropriate. This is a small reservation about a generally good restaurant that I intend to visit again.",['samgyeopsal'],1
146,Harvy9,Miss Korea,4.0,Very yummy food,"I think this place is great! The atmosphere is very relaxed, thr waitresses are great very smiley and understanding. The food was great however... It was pretty expensive",['samgyeopsal'],1
147,ashley l,Miss Korea,2.0,Only bibimbap,"The service is one of the worse. I even questioned myself what had I done to make the waitress treat my table with so much hatred, but I guess she did that to every customer. She didnot say a word or understand anything we asked. She gave us cold stares. The food is no where compare to Toppoki, the other korean restaurant. I think because the chefs are not koreans. My friends live near the restaurant, its the only reason we came there so often. The size was small, pricey and not authentic. The best dish is bibimbap, that is the only compliment I can give",['samgyeopsal'],0
148,Bhanudhir,Miss Korea,4.0,Yum yum yum,"My second visit to a hidden treasure Nice modern decor without being ostentatious. I love the barbecues recessed into each table allowing customers to cook their own food. You can't get any fresher than that. Vegetable dumplings, vegetable fritters and squid in spicy sauce followed by pork, squid and prawns cooked on the barbecue. Fantastic quality food at a very reasonable price. Definitely one to check out and try again. Bring lots of friends",['samgyeopsal'],1
149,Joseph L,Miss Korea,1.0,Aimed at students and not family friendly.,"As other reviews have said, the waiting service is poor. This is mainly down to the poor attitude of the waitress with glasses. There were several scenarios where arguments nearly broke out. The food is average and I've had better in London. They do not have space for you to put buggies and it ends up near the door. I did't feel comfortable with this.",['samgyeopsal'],0
150,AdamTien,Miss Korea,2.0,Not worth it!,"I came down to Birmingham for the day (from London) for business reasons and was craving some Korean food after a hard days work, but had no idea on where I could get some. So then I contacted a few friends who resided in the city and asked for recommendations, which then later they brought me to ""Miss Korea"".

When we first stepped into the restaurant we weren't greeted, my first impression of the interior was that it was immaculate and bold. However, it was quite smokey inside as there was an open kitchen but also meat being grilled on some customers table tops, but that was understandable. After being noticed a few minutes later we were then seated and decided to order:
3 portions of bulgogi
1 portion of la Galbi
1 portion of lettuce
2 portions of kimchi cabbage
1 portion of seasoned spinach
1 portion of dukbokki
1 portion of rice
1 portion o fkimchi fried rice
and 4 drinks

The food was of good quality but had it's flaws, such as the dukbokki was quite over cooked which resulted in a really mushy texture, the kimchi fried rice was quite on the dry side and also the portions were quite small compared to the price. But that wasn't the problem, the real problem was the staff and service. Firstly, the female staff who was serving us was sulking for some reason and seemed like she didn't want to serve us. Her attitude towards us, was like she didn't care about anything and just wanted to go home. After our order was taken, we had to wait rather long for our food to arrive and then when it finally arrived some dishes were missing. For example the meats arrived but the lettuce and rice were nowhere to be found and it seemed that the waitress had forgotten about them. Which then I reminded her and she said, I quote ""okay"" and left. No apology whatsoever. When we nearly finished the meat, she then brings out the rice and lettuce and still no apology. With then we decided to just finish quickly and leave as we didn't felt welcomed.

The food was of good standard but the price was a bit of the high side. The staff and service however was the final killing blow that assured me to never come back to this restaurant and try else where.",['samgyeopsal'],0

153,Nakte S,Miss Korea,3.0,Mostly bland,"This was my first experience with Korean food, and I was excited to go since my friends hyped up Miss Korea to me the night before. I have heard of bulgogi and kimchi, and always wanted to try them, so I was looking forward to the trip.

Upon arrival, we were seated at a table for four people (with five of us). The grill also appeared to be broken. It took ten minutes of nervous whispering and attempting to flag down the waiting staff for us to be moved to a bigger table with a working grill.

The ordering felt rushed and we had to send away the waitress as we didn't feel ready, and when she came back we had to rush a decision out of a feeling of awkwardness. I was then told by a friend who had been here before that their kimchi is not authentic at all, and would be a disappointment, so I decided to forego it. The food itself took a really long time to arrive, with the first main arriving close to fifteen minutes before the last. I found the starter (sadly I forgot the name, it looks like a deep fried pancake folded in half over some filling) and my main (bulgogi chicken with veg and rice in a hot stone bowl) generally bland and even a tad sickening in taste. The only redeeming quality of the main was the meat, which was delicious, but scarce. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the beef bulgogi and beer marinated beef that we could grill ourselves. They were absolutely delicious, but too felt like very little meat for £6+ per plate.

As another review points out, the service is terrible. The waiting staff pay no attention to what goes around them (we had to raise our voice to borderline shouting in order to get their attention from a meter away), the two waitresses seem very timid and even scared. Another lady, who appears to be their manager, has a very hostile air about her, made no effort to seem welcoming when talking to us and berated the two girls in the plain view of customers. When they do appear, the waitresses would come to the table, take the utensils and stir the meat on the grill after seeing you do it, before walking off without a word? Empty plates were not taken away from the table through the meal and once again the staff had to be almost shouted to in order to tell them that we would like our bill.

Overall, I wasn't very impressed with the restaurant apart from the novelty of the grill, which I did enjoy. As far as I understand the food isn't very authentic, and isn't a great representation of quality of Korean food. The service is poor and I felt like I overpaid for the little food that I did eat. I told my friends I stopped eating because I had enough and wasn't hungry any more, whichever as true enough, but the cause of that was a lack of appetite, and not a full stomach. The only reason I can see myself coming back to Miss Korea is for the grill meats, and exclusively that.",['samgyeopsal'],0
154,Bhanudhir,Miss Korea,4.0,What a gem,"Came to Miss Korea on the recommendation of a good friend who accompanied me. Nice modern decor without being ostentatious. My friend chose the menu and I was very pleased. The starters of chicken dumplings and fried vegetables were nice and the edamame fresh but it was when the table top cooker was opened up and I was presented with freshly lightly fried pork, squid, prawns, mussels and salmon I realised how good the cuisine was.

160,tanewman,Miss Korea,3.0,Something different for Brum,"Location - Central, directly opp Arcadian car park

Atmosphere - V friendly staff, really welcoming it's quite modern but as though it's been done on the cheap so I wouldn't recommend as a romantic venue.

Food - I had never tried Korean food and enjoyed the different flavours. We didn't go for anything in the BBQ menu (where the meat is cooked at your table) but wish we had given it a try.

All in all, nice flavours, fresh food, a tad greasy - give it a try!",['samgyeopsal'],1

162,Francoph,Miss Korea,4.0,Relaxed and enjoyable,"Having read some of the reviews, we were quite anxious about eating at Miss Korea, but we needn't have been. The service was thoughtful and help was offered but not pushed. The friends we went with had been several times before. I really enjoyed the dish I had with eel, as did one of our friends. My partner had a beef dish and the other friend had tofu. The kimchi and other side dish were very spicy but delicious and gave us something to nibble before our main dishes arrived. Drinks were good too - I had a soya drink, one friend had beer and the two men shared a spirit which, whilst good at the time had rather an unfortunate hangover as an after effect. Probably best avoided! We were not hustled or harassed and were able to enjoy a very happy evening chatting and enjoying good food. We'll definitely return and hope to try some of the other dishes next time. Thank you miss Korea.",['samgyeopsal'],1

164,simond1974,Miss Korea,2.0,could be better,"me and my wife visit Birmingham to shop at the Korean restaurant in Selly Oak then like to have a meal out somewhere. we found this place through tripadvisor. First time we went all seemed ok a little expensive for what is kimbab cheonguk meals but barring that food was ok. Went again today and food was of average quality and prices for the dishes seemed more expensive. we ordered food and drinks including a seafood pancake which was way too small also the portions of bibbimbap were too small even my son (10 years old) complained of being still hungry after the meal. Biggest shock was getting the bill 3 pounds for water and 2 pounds for a glass of warm sprite that had been served out of a 2 litre bottle from the supermarket.
Seriously!!! having lived and worked in Korea for 6 years I know that you will never attain the same service standards as there, but saying that, charging for water in a Korean restaurant......
As a lover of Korean food I wont be going again. Sorry!!!",['samgyeopsal'],0
165,AJMids,Miss Korea,2.0,I'd give it a 'Miss',"I thought we'd give this place a try having been to two other Korean bbq restaurants in the area of town, looks okay from the outside and it wasn't busy plus the menu looked nice in the window.
We were quickly seated and set about choosing our food - there is a good bbq selection but I fancied something different so we chose a couple of starters, a side, two mains and an extra. This didn't take too long but then the waiting began.
There were two other couples and a table of around ten guys who were doing their own bbq and didn't need much assistance. The kitchen seemed well staffed, two girls serving but one was also doing the bar and the manageress was easily spotted in the kitchen too.
More waiting.........
I haven't even been asked what I want to drink yet.
More waiting.........
Im getting impatient and annoyed now but I am still being ignored by the serving staff.
Okay now I'm angry and I decided in one minute I am going to get up and walk out.
45 seconds in I get served!. We order everything and it doesn't take too long to come - it all comes at different times and overall the food was very nice, couldn't fault it.
but then the waiting starts again........
Ive finished my drink and want another, I even position the empty glass to the side of the table near the servers but it doesn't happen.
I wouldn't mind some dessert too but im still sat around waiting and getting impatient again and eventually I announce '*$%% it' and get up, pay and leave.
Luckily you pay at the counter and don't ask the waitress for a bill otherwise I would of been there much longer.

They missed out on me having another couple of beers and trying the Korean rice wine plus a couple of desserts. I wont go back again - I did think about venting my anger at the manageress but she just looks at you from the kitchen and doesn't give any direction to waiting staff.
If it was busy then god help anyone wanting to get served.
I had to go somewhere else for pudding and a few beers and I wont go there again. There are much better Korean restaurants in the quarter so I would give Miss Korea a big miss.",['samgyeopsal'],1
166,stendec63,Miss Korea,4.0,Good value Korean Food with a on table BBQ option if you want,"After sharing a room with several Korean ladies, my daughter has a love for Korean culture, especially the food!

We try and find a good Korean food when ever we travel together, and closer to home as often as we can. A weeks holiday and a rainy day was a good excuse to try out Miss Korea, a BBQ style place close to the cinema.

The decor is minimalistic, with stainless steel and chrome predominated. The food and staff were Korean (so my daughter said). Despite being a busy Sunday lunchtime we were seated quickly. The menus are in Korean and English, and coded (in case you don't want to try and pronounce the names) with colour pictures to give you an idea of what to expect.

A complementary small portion of spicy korean salad to start with was a good start.

We ordered KIMCHI CHIGAE and BULGOGI DOLSOT BIBIMBAB and both of those were excellent. My soup came bubbling hot, and was full of flavour and spicy. Rice was included. I would also recommend the jugs of fruit juice. The mango we had was great!

It was good food at a good price (under £30 for a meal with drinks and a starter). A chain worth supporting...",['samgyeopsal'],1

Nice friendly restaurant with BBQ facility in the center of each table allowing you to cook your own meal if you so desire. Its not a 5* restaurant so don't walk in there with high expectations of glitz and glamour, or outstanding Ritz table service. The prices are reasonable and the service is absolutely fine.

169,Noob1,Miss Korea,1.0,Terrible overall.,"I went last year when they first opened and had a very bad experience. The wait for being served was long and the food came separately which caused us to eat at separate times.
We went this time thinking the service would have improved by now but it hasn't. We were shown to the table after 5 minutes by the waitress whereas the owner chose to stand behind the bar watching. The first dish came half an hour later and still no sign of drinks. It was busy so it was understandable that the food would take awhile but we ordered around half 7 and only just had the main dishes served around half 8/9. The bbq was turned off so we asked the owner to check for us and then he told us the bbq on this table was broke and and he asked us to moved, I questioned him why it took them so long to let us know that and he blamed it on the waitress, he asked the waitresses and she confirmed that it wasn't brokenand then he pushed her away and got the kitchen to cook our meat inside. Overall it wasn't a very nice experience mainly because of the wait, service and also the food doesn't taste as good as Toppoki.",['samgyeopsal'],0
170,Maggie F,Miss Korea,4.0,Something a bit different.,"We decided to try this place for lunch on a quick trip to Birmingham. There were four of us. Our waitress was very helpful, explaining and recommending dishes. We had a selection of appetisers, some meat that we bbq'd in the pit on the table, a broth dish and teriyaki salmon. I have no idea how authentic it is but it was all delicious. The gyoza were better than wagamama. The other dishes were interesting and made a change from Chinese/Japanese/Thai. There was plenty of food but not too much. It came to £61 which I thought was good value, we only had soft drinks. Only point to improve was that the ladies loo could have been a bit cleaner.",['samgyeopsal'],1
171,luckyme200,Miss Korea,4.0,Enjoyable.,"Miss Korea is a small, but smart looking little restaurant. There is a detailed menu and lots to choose from. It sounds like some people have had a bad experience, but really in my eyes it was very positive. The menu offers great choice but doesn't give you too much support if you're not familiar with Korean cuisine, that said it compared favourably to my previous experience with Korean restaurants. The food was quick, well presented, seasoned and flavoured and good value. The drinks a little more expensive but not out of sync with other restaurants. We didn't have any experience with the tap water, but in fairness to them at least they're up front about it. The service was attentive, no waiting at all to be helped, there was no checking-in on your enjoyment during the meal which is a little unusual but really not an issue for me. I would go again and would be happy to recommend it to others too.",['samgyeopsal'],1

Staff were very helpful and we had three starters and two mains including a deep fried tofu starter and a spicy pork stew with kimche the pickled cabbage that seems to be very important to their cuisine. We also had a glass of white wine and an iced lemon tea. The food was delicious Anf plentiful and the bill was £29!

174,simon s,Miss Korea,1.0,Avoid this restaurant; Bill was calculated wrongly on purpose,"I used to like this restaurant until today. I've been to ""Miss Korea"" more than 5 times in the past 1 years, I like the food although it's a bit over-priced. Today me and my wife ordered 4 dishes, a ice cream and a coke, everything is ok until I have the bill, there're 2 more drinks on the bill(Strawberry milk shake& J2O papaya, totally 6 pounds) which we never ordered, in the meanwhile there's only one big empty cup on our table.

I asked waitress, she realized immediately before I told her what happened. She then went to modify bill and bring the correct bill back without a apology. She seems not very happy about we checked bill carefully and found out what they did to our bill. I asked some of my Chinese friend, they have the same experience of be given wrongly-calculated bill. I think they're doing this on purpose, because what they add into bills are drinks, which are their most profitable things in menu.

As people already mentioned before: they don't serve tap water. why? as far as I can tell, a big part of their profit are from drinks. if you have a tap water which is free, they earn nothing from their over-priced drink. eg: a Korean grape drink, in ""Miss Korea"" 2.5 quid, in 100 feet-away Chinese convenience store: 50p. Now maybe you can see the reason why they don't serve any tap water.

Avoid this restaurant. if you can't, be prepared that there won't be any tap water served. Carefully check your bill.

Pro: the food was ok.

Con: Serve no tap water, Add drinks which you never ordered to bill stealthily",['samgyeopsal'],0
175,Doug_1970,Miss Korea,3.0,"A good restaurant, but not authentic Korean","I travel to Korea often on business so am fairly familiar with authentic Korean food. I was looking forward to eating here and seeing how the food in Birmingham compared with Seoul.

Firstly, none of the staff are Korean. Not that this in itself is a bad thing, but it would be nice to have some Korean staff in a Korean restaurant instead of all Chinese. All of the staff were friendly and efficient though, so we had no complaints with the service.

I found the food to be a disappointment though. While they had many of the normal Korean favorites, our food tasted very bland compared to authentic Korean. We ordered bulgogi, which didn't come with any of the normal side dishes, we even had to ask for lettuce.

If you had never been to a Korean restaurant before, then this place would be fine. But if you've already been exposed to proper Korean food, then you're probably going to end up disappointed.",['samgyeopsal'],1
176,jhwang0204,Miss Korea,1.0,Not authentic....at all,"From a Korean's perspective, I didn't find food at Miss Korea at all authentic or tasty. I could have made a better Bibimbap myself; Yuk-Kae-Jang tasted like mild beef stock; Kimchi-Jeon too sweet; Sam-Gyup-Sal tasted like cardboard.

I was surprised how Kimchi-Jeon and Hae-Mul-Pajeon were on desserts menu.... Just because the English translation is ""Kimchi pancakes"" and ""Seafood pancakes"" doesn't mean they are dessert material - far from it! The waiter who served me wasn't familiar with the menu, which made me having to point out the dishes one by one with my finger.

I was also appalled by how they refuse to serve tap water. Yes, bad for their profit - but shouldn't they still serve it if the customer wants it?",['samgyeopsal'],0

179,Tiberious_ok,Miss Korea,4.0,Pleasant experience and really good food,"With only one review for this restaurant (and a bad one at that), I didn't have high hopes. But, my wife really wanted to have some Korean food before a concert (Symphony Hall, a 10min drive away). So, this is the only Korean restaurant we could find in Birmingham.

It has a car park directly opposite. The restaurant is on the edge of China Town, and looks ok from the outside. On entry, its clean and tidy, nothing glamourous but pleasant. The menu is very Korean I think, although I think some of the staff were Chinese (not surprising in China Town). The menu had a heavy BBQ component, with the option to have BBQ bucket on your table to cook the food, or pre cooked by the chef. We opted for the later, as had limited time.

There were also the famous spicy cabbage dishes and soups. A good idea was to have option of jugs for juice/drinks, at reduced cost, which is good especially if your driving...plenty of juices to chose from too.

The food was fresh, plentiful, good value and really tasty. Lamb skewers went down a treat, as did the beef in beer and sliced pork dishes.

The only thing I could fault was no hand drier in the small gents toilet. Waitress was friendly, polite and attentive.

Would go again, its a really good addition to the cuisine availble in Birmingham China Town.",['samgyeopsal'],1
180,wolvesBirmingham,Miss Korea,1.0,What a terrible day out,"I wanted some water for my 2 year old son and was refused. After our meal I challenged the owner about refusing tap water and he said it was not healthy. Probably he meant not healthy for his profit margins. Disgusting attitude.

I am a huge fan of Korean food and have tasted many wonderful dishes in Korea itself. This is without doubt the worst I have ever had. The bulgogi tasted like a Chinese stir fry and the bibimbap was just run of the mill and quite tasteless.

To add to our misery, the owner had a tense and heated meeting with his staff a few tables away from us which made us feel uncomfortable. It just shows how unconsiderate he is. These meetings should take place behind closed doors and away from the public. I felt ever so sorry for the Korean cooks, they looked so sad and downbeaten by the owner’s bully approach.

Birmingham really needs a Korean restaurant. This is not it and you will be wise to avoid it. A huge disappointment.",['samgyeopsal'],0

195,Ash6996,Taste of Korea - Amazing Chicken,5.0,First ever Korean dinner,"After the wife suggested Korean for the first time ever and we googled it, this place came up with mixed but mainly good reviews even right here on Trip advisor. We though we'd give it a go. After driving around Gulf hotel apartments twice I had to get out of the car to walk around a little but eventually found it. Location could be better however that's all made up for when you try the food.

Small premises but comfortable, ambiance a little lacking as well and the food quality actually deserves a better more fitting authentic Korean mood in a nicer more accessible premises.

Anyway to the food, we ordered the Marinated Korean BBQ beef, the mixed spicy/sweet chicken, the Kimche rice and vegetable rice. The order came with an amazingly zestful tasty cold soup and a lot of sides and sauce . From the moment this stuff hit my tastebuds I was in heaven and I have now added Korea to one of those places one must visit before they die if only just for the food. Fragrant, aromatic, mouth watering, and satisfying. We will definitely be back don't care what the naysayers have to say.

My friends and I ( a group of 5 people) had dinner here on the 21st of January, 2016. It's in an alley across from chocolate room. There is a little area to park your car in front of the restaurant. It's open 7 days a week. It's closed from 3 pm to 4.30pm. The prices are reasonable and the food is to die for. I had dukbokki, kimchi Jeon, japchae, my husband had bulgogi and my friend had bibimbab. They were all delicious. It is a small restaurant but if you miss Korean food in Oman you can definitely have it here.","['bibimbap', 'bulgogi', 'pajeon']",1

211,Rolando Jr L,Taste of Korea - Amazing Chicken,4.0,Excellent Korean food near Muscat Grand Mall,"We're fond of Japanese and Korean dishes, and ever since the first Korean restaurant that we discovered near Ghala closed, we missed eating authentic Korean food in Muscat. That's why when friends told us that there's another Korean restaurant in the capital, we searched for it and tried their signature dishes. We were not disappointed.
The chicken was fantastic (there are 2 variants, one glazed with honey-barbecue sauce, the other just plain fried). It is basically similar to the dish from our favorite restaurant when we visited Seoul. Their japchae was also superb, and the kimbap as well. Their bulgogi was not exactly what I expected, but it was also generally good.They even serve few Japanese dishes, such as the miso soup which we ordered, which, I would say, was also tasty. The only thing I was disappointed a bit was that the side dishes (ban chan) was fewer compared to the previous Korean restaurant that we used to visit.
This restaurant is a little bit small; there are only about 5 tables, if I remember correctly. There is ample parking space at the side of the building where the restaurant is located. In terms of location, the restaurant is not hard to find, as it is just on the opposite road of Chocolate Room, another popular establishment in Ghubra.
The price is a little bit on the expensive side, but that's how it is anyway in majority of restaurants in Muscat.","['bibimbap', 'bulgogi', 'pajeon']",1

The food is always good and they do have a limited selection of beer and wine. The food is Korean with some Japanese influences. The kimchi was not killer spicy, the dumplings were tasty, and the bulgogi (beef) was moist and tender. In the past I've had the very tasty but spicy kimchi soup. (Spicy items are clearly marked on the menu.) The decor in this small restaurant is the very home-like, with lots of Korean knickknacks on display. The service is polite and efficient, and the prices are reasonable for Boulder.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
219,RedFrost,Korea House,5.0,Amazing food with very kind and friendly owner!,"This place is a gem in Boulder, that few know about. This place has amazing food. I love their Mandoo soup. I always get that or their spicy beef soup. The kimchi is fantastic and the rice cooked to perfection. It is a family owned place (one of the few remaining in Boulder) where the husband serves the food and his wife cooks. He is the most pleasant person you will ever meet. He pulls out your chair for you when seating and always is attentive, and comes quickly if you need something. The restaurant is very cute and I admire the way he decorates. It is a random assortment of stuff from all over the world. The restaurant is always clean as if he just opened. The food smells delicious from the back. I have become a regular because of his food and the family’s kindness. I was having a rough day once and he brought a mochi dessert, on the house. If you are looking for quality Korean food at a reasonable price, this is the place to come. He is always so grateful to all who come to eat at his restaurant. This place, is by far my favorite place to eat in Boulder and I was born and raised here. He will go to any length to make sure you enjoy your meal. You can also do take out, but I highly recommend you stay and enjoy his hospitality. He has Korean and other Asian beers as well as sake of different types. This restaurant is sadly, tucked away behind a gas station so it is not visible from 28th street. But once you know where it is. It is very convenient with tons of parking available. Great place to eat alone, with family or friends. I always walk out with a smile on my face and a warmth in my belly due to his wife’s amazing cooking. To the customer who said that he charged them 20% tip without them knowing, then he did not read his receipt or the menu. So please disregard that review as, the owner is the farthest thing from a con man. As noted with the dessert he so generously gave to me. I have a feeling the customer leaving the one star review, had a party of six or more and it is common practice at restaurants, to place a 20% gratuity charge on this many at one table. So next time you want a really good place to eat with great service stop in here. It is well worth it. I guarantee you won’t be disappointed.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

222,MunichEricJ,Korea House,4.0,Good Korean food in Boulder,"We visited on a Monday evening just to check it out. I tried the Bulgogi and it was good and tasted just like the Bulgogi I get in Korea. The Kimchi was also authentic, and they offer Kloud beer on tap so I had that. The service was excellent, provided by a kind and friendly Korean fellow. Prices were very reasonable.
There is a wide variety, a mix of Korean, Japanese and a bit of “pan Asian” on the menu – I suppose that Boulder is too small to support a Korean- only menu. As for beer, not so many Americans have heard of Kloud, Hite or Cass, so no wonder that more familiar brands like Asahi and Sapporo are also offered.
There’s a pleasant atmosphere with seating for around 30, so it’s not very large.
I would love to see a real down and dirty grill- at- the- table pork or beef Korean BBQ place in Boulder – I’ll bet it would be a big hit. But for the meantime, Korea House is worth going to, and returning to.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
223,Luke M,Korea House,1.0,Barely edible,"I lived in Seoul for almost a decade and this place's food tastes nothing like real Korean food. Overpriced (though I wouldn't eat their food again at any price, even free) and the ""recipes"" have been changed to ""suit American tastes"". Ha.

If you are in Colorado and want food that is more indicative of the cuisine you can find in Korea, I recommend Daegee (either CO location) or Soban in Aurora. Neither is spot on, but they are the closest I've found.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
224,jeanporr,Korea House,4.0,"Delicious, quick lunch, with excellent service","Contrary to previous reviews, the owner/server is friendly and efficient. He doesn't try to be your best friend, but that's not his job. He does see to it that your food arrives promptly, and that you have everything you need. I didn't need to wave him over for anything; all was foreseen. He checked several times during the meal, just in case.

I had the bento box with beef and dumplings, which proved quite tasty. It also included a cabbage side and rice. Unlike some Asian restaurants here, this one offers brown rice, a healthful plus.

The decor is a combination American country/Asian kitsch. The location is an easily-accessible strip mall with ample parking.

I will definitely return often, and I would encourage others to give it a try.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

The salad was a bit of iceberg lettuce with no dressing. The white rice was harmless. When the manager (owner?) asked how our food was, we told him.

So my thought was, ah new management, new cook. Alas, new does no mean better. This restaurant changes hands frequently, but seems never to rise above mediocre.

This restaurant is the closest thing to being in Korea that I have experienced in Colorado. I lived in Suwon, South Korea for more than a year, and this place captures the ambiance exactly. It's like eating in a Korean living room, with fun little decorations everywhere.

The food is fresh, tasty, and authentically Korean. We didn't order sushi, but kept to the Kimchi Jjigae (김치 찌개) and Kimchi Jeon (pancake). It was relaxing, and we had a great conversation with the owner over our food. After he learned that we had lived in Korea, he gave us a Kloud beer on the house!

Seemed like very authentic food, dinnerware, decor, even music.
This is a small, family run restaurant. You feel like a guest in their home. Everything nice quality and gracious. Not inexpensive, but seemed worth it to us. Portions seemed just right--more would have been too much, and we never take home a doggie bag.

Do not miss the Pearl barley Tea. It is different, but it is great. The people here work very hard to satisfy you. Some of the items on the menu are an adventure for some Americans so ask if Americans are going to like them. If you are looking for Adventure the food is very good. The Soups are particularly good . Spicy and full of vegetables and sea food. You can them to adjust the level of spice if the stock is not pre prepared.

243,Lee Y,Korea House,1.0,arrogant and racist waiter,"The waiter of this restaurant was extremely ARROGANT and went totally psycho when two of us asked whether we could sit at a table of 4 when there is only one table taken by two guests in the entire restaurant with about 10 tables total. He owner said IT WAS THEIR LUNCH TIME and they did not want 2 guests to sit at a table of 4. I asked then why the other two guests were sitting at a table of four. he said because they were Americans. At that moment my friend and I just wanted to get food and leave but his rudeness was not done yet. When we ordered and asked about lunch special, the owner said NO, IT IS NOT LUNCH TIME! Then I asked:""When is your lunch time then?"" He got pissed and asked us to leave. OMG! This is horrible.

I promised we were not being arrogant or anything. At the beginning I was thinking his rudeness might be a result of his limited English, as an immigration I should have more patience and sympathy. But no, i was wrong. He was rude and the reason he refused us what he served with the two white Americans was because we are not white.

Although I did not have the chance to dine here, I got a chance to glance at their menu. It was pricy compared to many other Korean restaurants in this area. And they don't have many typical Korean dishes on their menu. So it might be a good thing we were driven out of this place.

It was my first time ever to write a review about anything online. I just feel there are so many hard working restaurant owners and waiter/waitresses to be supported and this kind of people should run out of business if they are not changing their attitude.

Avoid this restaurant.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",0
244,Melanie S,Korea House,1.0,Rudest Owner Ever.,"I have never felt such an overwhelming urge to write a negative review for an establishment.

I walked in after a long day of work looking to order some takeout and enjoy it at home. After perusing the menu I decided to order an appetizer (vegetable dumplings) and a roll of sushi. I'm a tiny gal (4'11 and 96 lbs.) so this is more than enough to feed just myself. I had, however, been looking forward to trying the food here and had every intention of coming back and eating in another day when I had more of an appetite and could order a larger meal. Today I wanted to keep it simple. The owner, however, refused to even serve me unless I ordered an entree, which I simply wasn't interested in today. Not only that, but if I asked any questions about the items or dishes, not only did I not get much of a response, he just seemed irritated and responded in a very condescending manner.

I left absolutely disgusted with the way I was treated, and you can rest assured I will NEVER step foot in this restaurant again. I'm positive there are plenty of other restaurants in the area that would be happy to have my business and who are actually interested in having returning customers.

Good luck establishing any kind of clientele with this attitude.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",0

The spicy pork wasn't at all like any bulgogi we have had anywhere. The flavor wasn't there and the sauce was pasty tasting. The meal came with two small dishes of kimchi and pickle none of the other accompanyments that I normally see.

It looked like the decor had changed so perhaps it is under new management but they had better review their changes or I'm pretty sure the will go out of business. My favorite dish is Bulgogi ( a korean BBQ beef). This restaurant used to have wonderful slices of this marinated beef. The dinner I got today arrived in a ""bento box"" which is a novel way to serve Asian food, however, the meat that came in the box was like leftover scraps. It was about four tablespoons of beef shreds, the biggest was about the size of a dime. The was about half a cup of rice, a teaspoonful of green vegetable and about a tablespoon of Kimchi. I had ordered a combo with dumplings ( gyoza) and there were four of those without the unique dipping sauce that usually accompanies it. $2.00 worth of food costed $10.50. I left there very diappointed and hungry! Sad to say, I will not be back!","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",0

I travel a lot and always seek out asian restaurants. Korea House isn't 5 star but it is very good. The Kimchi is great. Pickled veggies are good.

The Kalbi (my favorite) is very good. The galbi was disappointing

252,Lpulitude,코리아하우스,1.0,Royal cuisine not Royal at all,"We've had high expectations as we booked the Korea royal cuisine online costing us quite something even the package we chosen was the cheapest one.

The experience was contrary to what we expected. First, we were not sitted in a Palace like dining area. In fact it was like a shack with no window to any outside view and only big enough for 4 square tables inside. Next there's no air circulation comfort in the room, and it's next to the kitchen. So no ambience, no comfort and no view!

The food spread was good but was averagely prepared. There are couple of nice dishes such as the nicely cooked abalone but a lot other were very basics & ordinary. The cutlery used were also very ordinary making us feel the value for money is not worth it. Not to mention the beef was so tough that Myeongdong street bbq beef is so much better!

Conclusion, we feel the charges is simply not worthy the food & ambience provided, and we suspected this is far from the real Royal cuisine. Skip this!","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

The reception where guests were received was bare, and I mean really bare. There was only a standing podium and a staff to receive the guests and check the name for the reservation. We were led to a dining room which looked like a dining hall. Not a tinge of class or history in there. Lunch was mediocre. We can get better food costing much less in restaurants in town. Description of the buildings within the compound seemed very interesting in the website but again I was disappointed. I mean they were architecturally nice traditional buildings but not as grand as I expected.
I was disappointed with the meal but may be it was lunch and the set meal that I gave have chosen is a let down. I give them the benefit of doubt that the Korean banquet and the meal with show may be better. The only thing traditional from this experience is that all the lady staff are dressed in their hanbok.

There were a few dishes that were OK, but overall they food lacked seasoning, and tasted like it was made in a hurry, like the sweet and dry bulgogi. There were only a few tables dining, those of us who were hoping the reviews of poor food would be wrong.

On the other hand, the show was very well done, even my niece and nephew enjoyed it, and they don't speak Korean.

Staffs are accommodating, friendly, and totally no issues for English communication. As I traveled with my pregnant wife, I do not have issues on asking them for those prohibited foods for her like raw meat and those with caffeine. Regarding the food, the food is great and a bit different compared to the typical menu on restaurant, thus not sure if those are actually traditional. What I remember is that the servings are small but it is a lot, and they serve it so fast that we haven't finished yet with the first one but they are already serving the 3rd dish. But i think they are doing it so you will able to finish your meal before the show starts. About the show, same with the other reviews, recommendable and very traditional. I'm about to give a perfect rating for this review because of the show, but I feel that the price is very expensive that I expect more, maybe on the food, and no extra charges on the drinks.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

259,zimonjonez,코리아하우스,1.0,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! I would give zero star if I could.,"I don't really give reviews online, but I believe visitors should stay away from this restaurant, as my experience was totally disappointing.

My wife and I went to Seoul in October 2015 for our honeymoon. Although we haven't been to South Korea before, we do enjoy plenty of authentic Korean food in Sydney.

We picked this restaurant as we saw the good reviews on the internet. However, we were extremely disappointed after having the Royal Cuisine.

Before visiting the restaurant, I made a booking via email and to make sure we could have the ""Royal Meal"". Although I've got a response saying food did not need to be ordered in advance, I was told at the restaurant that ""Royal Meal"" need to be ordered in advance...

I admit that the service was good, and good service is common in Seoul, but the food was extremely bad. The meat was rough and the food was cold. We were expecting authentic traditional Korean food, but we ended up having some westernised/fusion dishes...

The meal was a disaster not only because of the low quality of the food, but also the environment. We were lead into a room where all foreigners dinning together, while I saw Koreans were allowed to dined in spacious traditional rooms.

For all the unpleasant hours I spent in this restaurant, I was charged $350 AUD for a 4-person meal. That is very unreasonable for the quality of food provided, as a good Korean Bulgogi (BBQ) dinner for 2-person would cost less than $100 AUD in Seoul...

That said, Seoul is a great modern city and I really enjoyed staying there. This was a bad experience, but other local restaurants I've been to were extremely good. I believe this place was setup to rip off tourists...

For visitors who's travelling to South Korea and looking for a Royal Cuisine, please look somewhere else and stay away from this restaurant!","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0
260,pandjdmura,코리아하우스,5.0,Enjoyed Korean Royal Court cuisine of the Joseon Dynasty in a traditional atmosphere,"First, I want to warn you that there are two restaurants called ""Korea House"" in Seoul. Take care which ""Korea House"" entry on Trip Advisor you are looking at. I am writing about the restaurant with this phone number 82.2-2266-9101 and the web address: http://www.koreahouse.or.kr/eng/?en_skin=index.html.

That other ""Korea House"" listed within Trip Advisor has several reviews that I believe are for the restaurant we visited. The other Korea House specializes in Korean beef dishes and the menu looked very interesting, but we did not eat there. The staff was gracious dealing with our mistake and called us a taxi.

Overall, the meal, service and environment were wonderful. We arrived an hour late, and in the dark, but were welcomed with smiles from our hostess wearing a traditional Korean costume. We were lead through a large patio area where dances and other programs are conducted during the day. On the far side we ascended a set of rough stone steps and followed a cobble stone path to the building we would dine in. It was very impressive and the landscape lighting made it even more so.
There are several separate buildings and if you sign up for a court cuisine dinner, you will be seated in your own dinning room. My daughter in law was concerned about my back and knees and asked that we be seated at a table rather than eating laying on the floor. When our hostess slid the door back of our dinning room the table was low, but the space under the table was hollow, allowing us to sit normally on padded seats that had backs. Very comfortable!

The dinner is very similar to ordering from a ""tasting menu"" at a nice restaurant.
There are several courses depending on the meal you choose. We had the Eojin Jeongchan dinner. It is pricey, but you are paying for the experience as well as the gourmet food. Follow the link I provided above, click on ENGLISH, and look at Royal Cuisine to see the menu. All of it was delicious and the experience was fun. Our waitress, dressed in the traditional costume, spoke good English and was very helpful, attentive, and did not seem perturbed in the least we arrived an hour late.

I don't know when I will have an opportunity to return to Seoul, but the full experience of this place was worth the stop. If you time it better than we did, you can also attend a theater production following the meal. See the website for details.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

262,DownVegasTown,코리아하우스,5.0,Traditional Joseon Dynasty meal and show,"We truly enjoyed the meal, service and show. It was one of my favorite experiences in our 17 night trip to Korea. My wife is Korean and researched the menus and shows on the Korean website. Since I am a picky eater, we chose the Haerin Jeongsik menu. A little more expensive but very good. we accompanied the meal with a couple bottles of Bek Se Ju which became my go to drink for the rest of the trip.

A quote from their website: The traditional court cuisine of Korea House is cooked on the basis of the records contained in ancient literature. The foods are cooked by superior chefs at Korea House under the supervision of 'Han Bok-ryeo' who has been designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 38 for his expert knowledge about the court cuisine of the Joseon Dynasty).

Service freindly and outstanding. Maybe due to the constant delivery of new dishes throughout the meal and my wife's ability to communicate in Korean if they didn't understand my Texan. All the staff were dressed in traditional Hanboks.

We enjoyed the show and would see it again, given the opportunity. I particularly like the instruments and sounds they made. One selection was 4 drummers on stage playing together and putting on quite a show. I also like the dancers and the way their dresses shape while spinning around. All seemed very graceful in their movement.

After the show, the performers were in the lobby for people to take photos with them.

We took tons of photos but unfortunately they are still on the phones. Go to http://www.koreahouse.or.kr/eng/?en_skin=index.html for more info on food and show.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The food served are in small portions and you can expect up to 10 varieties of traditional food served one after another by girls clad in hangboks. You may not know what you have been served and the best thing to do is to ask the waitresses on what and how best to eat it. As expected the meals can be very pricey.

266,Kidkong,코리아하우스,5.0,Korean BBQ at it's best and most expensive!!,"Korea House is known for it's great service and quiet settings. You pay a premium for the location. And the restaurant is only made up of private rooms so I recommend reservations, but usually they can squeeze a party of four.

The side dishes are usually exquisite here, the beef is of the best quality. Though for basically the same quality you can literally walk about 100 meters to Saebyuk-jib and eat good meat. But you are paying a premium here for the privacy and small touches. For example the charcoal that they use is not preheated and they light in front of you since they are using a very good quality of charcoal.

Ask the waitress for the best cuts of meat that are available at the moment and they will recommend for you. As each day quality can vary.

They also have a dried fish (bori-geul-bi) with a green tea soup with rice to finish the meal. You take your hot rice and drop it in your cold green tea bowl. Take a piece of the dried fish that is broken up for you and dip it in the sauce they give and immediately eat the rice that was mixed with the green tea soup. It is fabulous.

I enjoy the dish so much that I visit the restaurant for the dried fish during lunch time and skip the BBQ.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

Aside from soy sauce, they have a red sauce available which compliments any hot dish.

They do have table top hibachi available if you want to cook the BBQ meat yourself.

My wife had the Dolsot Bibimbap which is a veggie mix with Kimchi in a hot bowl. It also had an egg in it. I had the Sundubu Tziigae that is a hot pot with seafood and tofu. The taste was great but only 1 shrimp, 1 piece of squid and a tiny piece of probably octopus. They did refill the little dishes of kimchi items; service was very good. Overall I felt the quality and portions dropped. Korean dishes have been a favorite of ours for some time.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

We sat down and immediately noticed very LOUD rap music coming through the restaurant speakers. Young servers and several young people standing around kitchen doors. We asked if they would turn off the music, and they asked if we wanted to move to another table. So we moved to a table at another Korean restaurant.

For a smaller party without grills, It also has quaint private tables. The wait staff are always very cheerful and will explain in broken english what you want to order. Lovely people will serve the side dishes that are always fresh and always an incredible variety. A variety of Korean wines are offered that are served in a special sake cup. Reasonable prices and a great menu await you.

They made my hotel room smell so delightful every time the fridge door opened and I almost cried when I left the leftovers in the fridge due to a long day ahead on the road.
For someone who enjoys Korean BBQ short ribs and live/travel to Orlando or Central Florida, this is the place to go. The beef bulgogi was amazing, too. Portions were large and the appetizer of dumplings was very tasty, too. We love Korean food, though we admit we typically do not eat everything. This place is the place for someone who wants to try Korean or eats it often, in my opinion. We will be back. I will also bring a cooler and get an extra order of short ribs.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

318,bousozoku,Korea House Restaurant,4.0,"Amazing food, good service","I'd been to Korea House a number of times in the 11 years I lived in the Orlando area. As with any Korean restaurant, they stick to real Korean food. There is no Americanization for any reason. If you don't like spicy food (and I don't mean spicy like Mexican food--that's mild, actually), you're probably better to go somewhere else, but there are a couple of options safe for non-Koreans.

I travelled to the Orlando area a few days ago for the first time in four years. I got together with 3 friends and we visited Korea House. They've resolved a lot of situations since moving to the newer location north of Rangeline Road. The service was quite good. They've installed vents over a few tables to allow for Korean BBQ. Korean BBQ is where you choose ingredients and cook it at your own table.

The friends chose Gal Bi, Bul Gogi, and Pork Bul Gogi. I chose Dae Gu Jji Gae. They really, really liked the food, and being Caucasians, they don't have much experience with real Asian food. That's not a criticism--it's a fact, when places like P.F. Chang's represents itself as real Chinese food, what can you think?

I was thrilled with my Dae Gu Jji Gae, but I really dislike the fish bones. I know what's going to happen. They don't remove the meat of the fish and put it in the pot to cook. They put the fish in the pot in pieces, including the bones. Cod is typically bony anyway, so it was a good-bad choice. I scooped a bit of the broth into another bowl and let the three of them try it. They were especially surprised when I told them that it was medium spicy for real Asian food.

We had a good visit and a good meal. Korea House's owners--a family of four--care a lot about food and people. They really want you to have food you'll always love. It shows!","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The food was the same, the Fish soup with red chili broth was great and tasty. The kimchi soup with Tuna also very delicious but the Bibimbap a little-bit boring, too dry and no have a good taste of sesame paste as in Seoul or any city in Korea. The free appetizers is always generous portions like in many Korean style restaurant. The high light was the Cinnamon drink, a little bit too sweet for western tongue but compliment the spiciness of Korean chili paste on the dish.

We definitely did not go away hungry.

327,You Y,Korea Haus,1.0,The worst experience I have ever had in a Korean restaurant!,"The worst experience I have ever had in a Korean restaurant!

I am an Asian myself and have been in South Korea. I can say that I have had amazing Korean food everywhere in the world, but for sure NOT in this Korea Haus!

I went there with my friends and wanted to try out this Korea Haus, since our favorite Korean restaurant just moved to Charlottenburg. The food was disappointing and the price was way too high according to the size and the taste of the food. The four of us ordered four dishes, including two portions of Bulgogi, one fish soup and one noodle dish. The bulgogi cost 15€ per person, and the two portions we had were not even enough for one person to get full. There was barely anything in the fish soup, maybe four tiny pieces of fish?! The noodles were kinda OK, but did not have much flavor.

Two small side dishes came with the food. Since the four of us shared the side dish, we asked for another portion of kimchi. The waiter was nice enough to tell us that we have to pay for extra kimchi. We were surprised to hear that because ALL the normal Korean restaurants offer side dishes for free, as a custom. The waiter went to ask the owner if we could get one for free. The owner came out from the back with such an arrogant attitude and told us we cannot get one for free. He said, if we want to have free side dishes, we should go to another place. We were totally shocked and could not believe it. The owner obviously only wants money and does not care if any customers come back again or not.

Furthermore, I, for the first time, had diarrhea after having Korean food.

As a foodie, I will never go back to this place again and would also advise all Korean food lovers to avoid this place. You deserve better food and treatment for your money!","['jeyukbokkeum', 'gimbap', 'jjamppong']",0
328,virginia m,Korea Haus,4.0,surprise!,"i would have never thought that this place could reserve such a surprise!
we had the buffet (6€). we didn't eat meat but the rest was more than enough! there is a selection of korean pickles (kimchi, cucumber pickles, carrots, beets, delicious stuffed peppers and others) you can tell that they are homemade. kimtchi was not particulary strong flavoured, as i like it, but my companion preferred it like this.
the lady prepared for us freshly deep fried vegetables puffs, banana and fish fillets. I was really surprised, the fish was actually really tasty and fresh, perfectly well cooked, juicy and delicious! even the rest rest was not greasy at all.

there were a few other dishes that I haven't tried, from what i could see it was noodles in different sauces with veggies and meat. there was a hot and sour meat soup as well, and rice of course!

I was so happy of changing my mind about this little family-run restaurant. the owners really care about what they are doing, and even though they don't have many clients, whenever someone arrives they treat him like a real host at their place.

the furnishings is really heavy and peculiar, but in its own way it gives a feeling of authenticity (though not Korean! elvis was printed all over on the seats :) ). the owners seem to be there out of any pretention, if not to do the best they can to prepare good food.

i left this little place with a smile and bitterness too,for having prejudged koreas Haus as just another fake orientalish imbiss for so long before TRYING IT!

Squash is virtually non existent, golf is too expensive, but the Cinder Bar , oh the Cinder Bar. From the first moment I entered the doors of this small bar, I realised it had a huge heart. The guy who runs it tirelessly is Warren, a guy who remembers everyone’s names. The beer selection is amazing ... 12 on tap and at least 12 different bottled ales.

381,Kevin S,더 신더 바,5.0,Home away from home,"Since moving to Korea in January 2017, this is by far the best spot in the area!! There is a great mix of local, expats and travelers passing through Incheon/Songdo leading to a ""never know who you might run into"" evening.

The location is a bit hidden for a first-timer, but that adds to the mystique. Once there, the interior is intimate and welcoming. There's also additional seating upstairs and a recently added dart machine for a fun competitive game with friends. And for spring and fall, there is outdoor seating as well (you will appreciate the air conditioning indoors during the Korean summer months!). Don't miss out on the monthly Trivia Night as well for a good time with co-workers or friends.

The food, with the recently expanded menu, is always great. Remember, the Cinder Bar is a bar, so the menu is very appropriate, but don't let that fool you in terms of quality and taste! My personal favorites are the colonel chicken sandwich and wings...which remind of wings from back in the US. The burger, fish sandwich, fish & chips and fries are also favorites and give a variety of choices. Cost is very reasonable and appropriate.

On to the beer....the Cinder Bar offers a dozen or so beers on tap and countless bottled beers. The tap selection is vast from Asia-Pac to Europe to US to local craft and includes many types (pilsner, stout, IPA, porter, wheat, etc.). The whiskey selection is also extensive with many of my favorite single malt Scotches!

And lastly, the services is always phenomenal, which is the main reason I return. Warren, the owner, and his staff are always welcoming to both regulars and first time visitors. He goes out of his way to introduce himself and get to know his patrons.

So if you've relocated to Songdo or happen to be passing through, I recommend an evening at the Cinder Bar.",['cocktail'],1

Cinder is run by absolute legend Warren, along with his mate Sam. These guys are hard-working, honest Kiwi blokes who always put their customers first. Warren even arranged free tickets to the baseball for me!

I’ve spent the past 6 months living in Songdo and visiting this bar on a semi-frequent basis. When I moved here I didn’t know anybody. Now I’m leaving Korea and most of the people I know have all been Cinder Bar contacts through Warren.

They show the baseball, rugby and many other sports, not to mention live bands and quiz nights. This place has all the hallmarks of a western style bar, but with a genuine Korean welcome.

Highly recommend you pay a visit any day of the week - oh and say hi to Warren and Sam for me!

384,G039260,더 신더 바,5.0,Hard to find but don't give up it's worth it.,I had a little trouble finding the place but once I did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet. Amazing! The beer was ice cold and served in good portions. Beer price was a little steep for me but I hit happy hour just right so I got a bit of a break. Totally satisfied. Pro tip if you are trying to find it: if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it's on the left side of the street before the bridge. It's in a bit of an alcove in a housing development. Set back off the road a tad. There's a sign the points left and I made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road. Unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it. Obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it's the first set of building after the bridge on the right. The staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice. The fish and chips are phenomenal. Did I mention the fish and chips are great. You should definitely try the fish and chips.,['cocktail'],1

Primarily because it is one of the few true Expat Pubs in all of Incheon. The Kiwi, Warren, runs the Pub, and he was most hospitable. We settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely. Even had time for some fish and chips: the fish was covered in golden batter, and the chips were delicious. The bar looks a little broken down (as was the area it was located in), but that added to the charm. If it was a rugby night, you could watch the TV, but it would've been a bit of a squeeze. There was also an upstairs, loft-style area.
Overall, a pleasant evening after work.",['cocktail'],1

Warren and his new partner Sam have crafted this cozy establishment into a welcoming, warm and friendly place to have a nice meal and a brew or two. If you are in the mood, they also have a superior selection of single malt whiskeys. The prices are the best you will find in Incheon and the atmosphere is unmatched. The food is excellent as well. This is a family affair and Warren's wife is the establishment's cook. Of particular note is the new hamburger offered which is a new collaboration between Warren and ""The Flying Chef"".

Despite being born in New Zeeland he has lived in Korea long enough to speak fluent Korean.

Mix these things together and you get a bar that performs, where the seats are always warm because nobody wants to leave. Awesome place.

546,Kevin S,더 신더 바,5.0,Home away from home,"Since moving to Korea in January 2017, this is by far the best spot in the area!! There is a great mix of local, expats and travelers passing through Incheon/Songdo leading to a ""never know who you might run into"" evening.

The location is a bit hidden for a first-timer, but that adds to the mystique. Once there, the interior is intimate and welcoming. There's also additional seating upstairs and a recently added dart machine for a fun competitive game with friends. And for spring and fall, there is outdoor seating as well (you will appreciate the air conditioning indoors during the Korean summer months!). Don't miss out on the monthly Trivia Night as well for a good time with co-workers or friends.

The food, with the recently expanded menu, is always great. Remember, the Cinder Bar is a bar, so the menu is very appropriate, but don't let that fool you in terms of quality and taste! My personal favorites are the colonel chicken sandwich and wings...which remind of wings from back in the US. The burger, fish sandwich, fish & chips and fries are also favorites and give a variety of choices. Cost is very reasonable and appropriate.

On to the beer....the Cinder Bar offers a dozen or so beers on tap and countless bottled beers. The tap selection is vast from Asia-Pac to Europe to US to local craft and includes many types (pilsner, stout, IPA, porter, wheat, etc.). The whiskey selection is also extensive with many of my favorite single malt Scotches!

And lastly, the services is always phenomenal, which is the main reason I return. Warren, the owner, and his staff are always welcoming to both regulars and first time visitors. He goes out of his way to introduce himself and get to know his patrons.

So if you've relocated to Songdo or happen to be passing through, I recommend an evening at the Cinder Bar.",['cocktail'],1

Cinder is run by absolute legend Warren, along with his mate Sam. These guys are hard-working, honest Kiwi blokes who always put their customers first. Warren even arranged free tickets to the baseball for me!

I’ve spent the past 6 months living in Songdo and visiting this bar on a semi-frequent basis. When I moved here I didn’t know anybody. Now I’m leaving Korea and most of the people I know have all been Cinder Bar contacts through Warren.

They show the baseball, rugby and many other sports, not to mention live bands and quiz nights. This place has all the hallmarks of a western style bar, but with a genuine Korean welcome.

549,G039260,더 신더 바,5.0,Hard to find but don't give up it's worth it.,I had a little trouble finding the place but once I did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet. Amazing! The beer was ice cold and served in good portions. Beer price was a little steep for me but I hit happy hour just right so I got a bit of a break. Totally satisfied. Pro tip if you are trying to find it: if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it's on the left side of the street before the bridge. It's in a bit of an alcove in a housing development. Set back off the road a tad. There's a sign the points left and I made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road. Unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it. Obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it's the first set of building after the bridge on the right. The staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice. The fish and chips are phenomenal. Did I mention the fish and chips are great. You should definitely try the fish and chips.,['cocktail'],1

Primarily because it is one of the few true Expat Pubs in all of Incheon. The Kiwi, Warren, runs the Pub, and he was most hospitable. We settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely. Even had time for some fish and chips: the fish was covered in golden batter, and the chips were delicious. The bar looks a little broken down (as was the area it was located in), but that added to the charm. If it was a rugby night, you could watch the TV, but it would've been a bit of a squeeze. There was also an upstairs, loft-style area.

We've been here quite a few times and haven't been too lucky. We check out Trip Advisor and guess who's #1, Cinder Bar! We're reading the reviews and Warren, the owner's name keeps popping up. We head out to find The Cinder Bar.
We walk in and are instantly greeted by, guess who? Warren! He is one passionate and friendly man. He wants us to enjoy ourselves. The music was so great. We were hungry and he recommended a few items and they were delicious.
Warren is known for his famous gin and tonic, I'm not a fan of gin. He insisted we try just one, which we shared. I slurped it down and now I like gin and tonics.
We ordered his homemade dip and chips, chicken wings and fish and chips. All very, very good.

Warren has made an excellent atmosphere and the customers were all in on it. I arrived alone but left with the intention of going back and continuing to meet great people.

I can't recommend here enough...alone or in a group you will have a fun time. And check out the g n t's! From an English man, they hit the spot and more.

After getting a stamp on our boarding card from the airline (needed!), we were allowed to leave the airport. Warren, the owner, gave our Uber driver directions on how to get to the bar (20 min from the airport). Kitchen open late for fish/chips and wings. Great alcohol selection (IPA imported from the U.S. on tap!) Great spot and will come back next time we have an overnight layover on Delta or Korean Air. Great mix of locals and expats. A must see on the the way through.",['cocktail'],1
641,Crespie,더 신더 바,5.0,Great selection friendly environment,"In Town for a conference and spent some time searching for a place to have a drink. Uncovered Cinders after a detailed search but surprised that they weren't top of the search.

Owner, Warren, an extremely friendly and welcoming host! A range of beers to cater for taste and an even better selection of spirits for even the most discerning palate.

I started with a malty indiga (American craft) served with some dubiously crunchy (typically Korean) nuts and graduated through Guinness and Stella Artois to an extremely reasonably priced local lager. Even a selection of Scottish beers and islay malt whiskeys for the more selective drinker.

Would highly recommend the venue to anyone!",['cocktail'],1

656,Dizzy Jay R,Korean BBQ,1.0,"Frozen meat, frozen staff, cold restaurant","Very disappointing.
We arrived Sunday late afternoon, the staff could not have been more disinterested. Despite only a few tables occupied the waitress was more interested in talking to other staff members than take our order.
The restaurant was physically cold. A couple at the next table had to put on their outdoor coats after ordering.
The (electric) grill took an age to warm up, and when the food arrived (full meat platter) half of it was still frozen, obviously previously band saw freezer cut -- no marinade. For a restaurant that claims to be a barbaque, the meat was given shockingly no thought, oddly butchered cuts that could not be cooked without undercooking one half or overcooking the other.

Service continued to be at best minimal. The grill was occasionally manned by a member of staff (taking away the one gimmick the style of cuisine has) who left without any word. When we took to cooking our own cuts of meat, we were sternly told on how to operate the grill as we obviously missed the 12 week preparatory course for dining.

We left with most of the meal uneaten- the waitress did not ask why or if the meal was saitisfactory. I'd like to personally apologise for interrupting her 8 hour paid social club.

If the idea of being exposed to cooking yourself is some kind of wild evening entertainment and you don't mind that there are far better places to actually eat, I'd highly recommend ""Korean BBQ"".",Korean BBQ,1

661,479karine,Korean BBQ,1.0,Birthday,Started off goodish they took full order then 5 mins later said had no chicken skewers for starters so we both took chicken dumplings then while ordering food started telling me I was ordering too much I was ordering for 3 people strange. The dumplings were good except one person asked for veg dumpling but got chicken. It’s a birthday she didn’t complain then the bbq food started to arrive but one of hot plates would only go to number two a warm setting when we complained as food was poaching not browning were told they knew it was broken so just use other one for 8 people we asked to move then every member of staff stood round our table telling us it will heat up give it time eventually they tried to intimidate us with restaurant and kitchen crew huddling round us. They said give us 2 separate tables then they were shouting tried to move another table threw the cooking food on top of the raw food aggressively....at that point we said we wanted to leave and they had spoiled his birthday. We found a better staffed restaurant to celebrate and will never eat there again.,Korean BBQ,1

I tried bbq sets and bulgogi dishes so far. They were always really tasty. Last time I got beef bulgogi, seafood pancake (that I adore) and a soup. Everything was just great. Little space, so if you don't book sometimes it's a bit of a risk. But it's really easy to book online. The service was great, everyone always friendly and welcoming. really nice a cosy atmosphere. It's not the cheapest place to eat but the quality is outstanding that every single penny is worth it. I really look forward to try the new branch as well. This place never disappoint.",Korean BBQ,1

No one really explained why. We ordered 1 starter which came very quickly as did the drinks. My main came 10 mins before my husbands but I assume as his was fried this was the reason for the delay. No one explained why. The food was very tasty, drinks a good variety and reasonably priced. Cannot really comment on staff as not a lot of interaction. After our mains we asked for the bill as it was 7:40 and did not look at desert/coffee menu. Would definitely come back but would reserve a table at a less busy time.",Korean BBQ,0

The lettuce, sauces and sides were topped up for free. The service was excellent with frequent grill changes and the food compared favourably to bbq I have eaten in South Korea. My partner very much enjoyed his first Korean bbq and would come again. I was initially a bit apprehensive as it was empty (at 5pm) and doesn't have a great exterior but I am glad we came in. Highly recommended, I just wish we'd had space for the kimchi pancake!",Korean BBQ,1
670,Martin H,Korean BBQ,3.0,A bit disorganised,"I'm in two minds about this place. Staff were friendly, it was packed and some of the food was very nice and the salads plentiful. The first time in the UK that I've tasted kimchi which actually had some kick to it. The pudding menu is very limited but some really unusual flavours - black sesame or red bean ice cream anyone? However some of the meat wasn't well cut & was therefore awkward on the barbeque and the overall value of the barbeque was poorer tan some I've had. Dishes arrived a little haphazardly and one a couple of times things were forgotten though came quickly after a prompt. Overall a pleasant evening but wouldn't go out of my way to come here again when there is so much other choice in the city.",Korean BBQ,0

673,MikeFromEdinburgh,Korean BBQ,3.0,Not great. Poor choice. Friendly but not wonderful service. Food was average at best.,"I've had Korean BBQ before. Its not really my thing since I can cook reasonably well at home so there's little fun in doing this in a restaurant. However my teenage daughters fondness for K-Pop made her ask to go here. We went. Table was OK. Place was light and airy. We saw about twelve ingredients on display for the customers to add to their meals. Soy and chili, coriander, spring onions, oyster sauce, two red bean sauces and so on. Nothing really exotic and nothin particularly Korean. Supermarkets have most of these ingredients nowadays. We ordered tempura starters and although huge and expensive for starters they weren't awfully good. Tempura batter was darker, oilier and heavier than the best I've had. Particularly for the prawns. My veg tempura was a little better but still not great. We ordered beef mains. Meagre portions considering other places in Edinburgh offer more variety. We got three bowls of lukewarm sticky rice which was more ""badly made"" than actually sticky. I can make better at home and I expect better from restaurants. I won't come here again. The Korean beer we wanted was out of stock. Our starters arrived several minutes apart and the nice waiting staff told me the kitchen was busy. There was about ten more diners in the place than we three. We had pints of Diet Coke each. Bill was pricey for what we received although average for the typical fare. Sadly this place was below par.",Korean BBQ,0
674,DaveMcD101,Korean BBQ,5.0,Amazing,Fantastic meal. Ordered a verity of marinated meats along with some sides. Fantastic food.

The beef BBQ I ordered was way too salty and the some was the meat was not marinated. The amount of meat was too little in comparison to its price and other Korean restruants in the city.

The waiters were not friendly and when the chef came out to greet us, he was really...odd and we felt really uncomfortable due to his attitude towards us.

Don't think we want to come back here again.",Korean BBQ,0

We ordered set D, which was a great combination of really fresh meat and was great if you're not sure what to order. The side dishes were delicious too, especially the salad and the marinated beansprouts, and the sauce was so tasty. We ordered rice as well, but it really wasn't necessary as the set itself is a very generous portion for 2 hungry full-grown men! I have, sadly, never been to Korea, but I have eaten at barbecue restaurants in the Korean district of Tokyo and this competes with the best of them.

We just randomly walked in, seeing many people there so we really thought this should be a good place for food. However, the food there made us soooo disappointed. We ordered four dishes and none of them tasted okay. The BBQ source was so weird and the beef was not fresh at all! As for the beef soup, I would say they destroyed every thing. It was so slight and there was not enough ingredients inside. All in all, I don’t recommend it. This restaurant is unqualified.",Korean BBQ,0

688,A M,Korean BBQ,3.0,"Good food, but mixed service","We ate at this Korean BBQ Restaurant the other night with friends (You cook your own food if you pick a BBQ dish).
Service was very mixed, girl waitress was excellent, organised and efficient, but the other staff not quite so, some were just lazy. Asked to get table cleared after main course, as they left it on table for 20 mins, even though the restaurant was quieter. The youngest staff cleared 1/4 of table, after requested, then proceeded to stand around and do nothing for next 10 mins. Eventually got table cleared, including glasses with wine remaining in them, after requesting again. Awful attention to guests.
Food was a different case. BBQ chicken was a generous portion, BBQ Prawns not so, only 6 medium prawns for the money. Stir-Fry was generous portion and tasty.
Restaurant really has to sort out service, as we left thinking there are better Korean BBQ restaurants near-by, so why would we go here again.
Tip should be given in cash, if added to VISA, staff do not get it, owner told me which is fair enough. If cash they get it (Legal requirement in UK anyway).",Korean BBQ,1

691,720leannt,Korean BBQ,5.0,Great food!,"Three of us went for dinner, having the kimchi pancake (very generous with the kimchi, and not too spicy if that’s something you’re worried about), the BBQ Set D and the Naengmyun (Cold noodles in a vinegar broth). The pancake was delicious and probably the best I have had outside of Korea! And the set includes a variety of 5 cuts of meat (the pork neck slice is especially tender and delicious) and 2 beers of your choice, this was an extremely generous portion and undoubtedly worth the price - a great option if you’re new to KBBQ and aren’t sure what cuts to order. The set also comes with all you need for Ssam (lettuce wraps) and the side dishes are also of a great quality (and are refilled for free if you ask). The naengmyun is also probably the best I’ve ever had, I highly recommend!! The service was great - very attentive and friendly, explaining how to use the bbq and changing out the grill halfway through to a cleaner one (something I was very impressed by, as many Korean restaurants don’t do that in the U.K).

695,emmacraggs,Korean BBQ,5.0,Outstanding meal in an incredible atmosphere,"Haven't tried Korean food in a Korean restaurant before, and was thoroughly impressed.
We visited on a Saturday evening but however, I DID NOT reserve a table. So my advice would be to do so as it was busy. I managed to get a slot at 8 o'clock and eagerly returned.
The atmosphere was electric, the bbq's which acted as a lively centrepiece for each table, were producing an enticing aroma which elevated our appetite.
We ordered the sirloin to BBQ and the rice cakes. The sirloin was nicely marbled and marinated in a delicious sauce. It was served with lettuce leaves, kimchi, salad and bean sprouts. All were delectable.
The rice cakes were chewy and tasty. Perhaps a little too sweet for my liking as I prefer hot, spicy food but still so delicious.
We got octopus balls and dumplings for starters which were both so incredibly yummy.
Nothing was disappointing. I can't say a bad word. All customers were smiling and laughing. The staff were incredibly helpful and polite. The pricing was extremely fair.
An excellent meal and a great introduction to Korean cooking.",Korean BBQ,1

697,760donc,Korean BBQ,5.0,Friday night dinner,Out in Edinburgh for a gig and decided to try something a wee bit different than the usual pub grub and have to say I was very impressed with what was our first ever Korean BBQ. We went for the the BBQ set meal D for 2 which came with to beers and prices at £38:80 was great value for what was served up. The only thing that we made a mistake on was not ordering side dishes of rice/noodles as wasn’t sure what the set meal came with..lol the Wee bbq plate in the middle of the table was quick to heat up and did not make the dining area to hot to enjoy your meal. The marinaded beef slice was outstanding and watch out for the chicken as it’s bloody spicy (well for my mouth anyway..lol) this restaurant is very busy and we were lucky to get a table for 2 not long after opening time so I would suggest phoning to make a reservation to make sure you’re not disappointed..,Korean BBQ,1

The staff were very helpful and accommodating. The value for the quality that we received was very good indeed.",Korean BBQ,1
704,sullko,Korean BBQ,5.0,Amazing food at a great price - great night out!,"One of the best Korean BBQs I've visited - their bulgogi marinade is absolutely on point, and the kimchi pancake was wonderful.

We ordered the mixed meats set menu for 2 and were treated to a quick overview of how to cook our food (we'd been to a Korean BBQ before so didn't need the full demonstration). Our grill plate was frequently refreshed, and all the meat was absolutely top quality. The pancake appetizer took awhile to come out, but we were given a bowl of amazingly tangy kimchi to make up for the wait - perfect spice, great texture and flavour.

The staff is charming and helpful and the food was perfectly composed.

Finish off your lettuce and sauces? No problem - they'll bring you more right away!

If you enjoy cooking and like to ""play with your food,"" this is a perfect night out. Just be sure to come with an appetite - that set meal for 2 is really enough for 3 or even 4 people!!",Korean BBQ,1

It was very authentic, we were also the only two non-Korean people in the entire restaurant which was full and booked out for the night, which must mean that this place is the real deal!

We ordered the Kimchi pancake and tofu bibimbap, both of which tasted just like in Korea, I savoured every bite! Not all Korean restaurants outside Korea seem to give the complimentary starters, but Korean BBQ does, which was great.

The prices were standard, each main ranging around £10-12. The service was efficient and good, no complaints.

A word of warning, this place is extremely popular, even on weekdays. We came on a Saturday to find it booked out so I made a reservation the following Monday online, which was ok. While we were there, the place was a full house and the waitress was turning down those without reservations as it was booked out until around 8:30pm.

The online booking is easy and quick, it fills up fast. I booked two days in advance for a Monday night, and the latest available was 6:30pm, with nothing available any later. So I advise booking quite a bit in advance or be ready to eat either early or late, as the 7-9pm times seem to get taken fast as the restaurant is small and seems to be very popular with Koreans in Edinburgh as well as tourists and locals.",Korean BBQ,1
707,Anna M,Korean BBQ,4.0,"Great food, good value","We had a reservation but turned out it wasn't needed. The food was great, overall good value, the service could've been a bit faster. The kimchi was a bit more sour than spicy and not as crunchy, but it's up to personal taste. I think they could serve kimchi as a complimentary sider to the bbq, as they would also in Korea. Some music would be nice.",Korean BBQ,1
708,1313mark,Korean BBQ,5.0,Fun and great food,"We really enjoyed our dinner here, The hostess/owner was great, we ordered the platter for two that included two beers, My wife does not drink beer, so it was a win win. The food was flavorful and fresh, and we had fun cooking it. Our server refilled the vegetable sides as needed . Well worth the money",Korean BBQ,1
709,Jay M,Korean BBQ,4.0,Solid Korean food in the heart of Edinburgh,This is one of your typical grill your own Korean places. Meat is fresh. Portions are large and the prices are reasonable. Only 3 sides with the meat less than what I usually get. They could also use another server but overall a good non tourist experience.,Korean BBQ,1
710,FlameOfFrost,Korean BBQ,4.0,Very tasty first experience,"My friend visited from the USA, where there are many Korean BBQ places. She took me here to experience it and we were very happy. Food is good, very filling, and the staff are friendly. When we arrived we were told the small restaurant was full, but instead of just turning us away the staff took my contact number and called us when a table became free. A very nice idea, meaning we could explore a bit more!",Korean BBQ,1
711,saltsugarspice27,Korean BBQ,5.0,A bit of Korean BBQ experience.,I love this place and remind me a BBQ place in Daegu that I used to go to. The meat choices are great and we had a lot of fun cooking and it’s a good chat. Waiter was so kind to offer extra salad if we needed more. Side salads taste great. Will recommend.,Korean BBQ,1
712,igal27,Korean BBQ,5.0,"Very tasty food, friendly staff, and an overall great dining experience","I had never been to a ""Korean BBQ"" before, so the entire experience was new to us. Luckily the staff is very friendly and helpful, and they were there to assist us in ""preparing"" our meal! You have a heating plate built into the center of each table, on which you ""barbecue"" your own food (meat, prawns, etc.), or you can order one of the prepared stir-fried dishes. One of us had the BBQ, and the other got stir-fried. We both extremely enjoyed our meals. Whether you have stir-fried or BBQ, the ""Korean way"" of eating it is by placing some of your cooked meal on a lettuce leaf, adding some of the condiments they bring you (spicy radish/bean sprouts/sauce), rolling it up, and eating the roll. Very tasty, and a fun/interesting way to eat, to boot! The prices were also quite reasonable. Highly recommended!",Korean BBQ,1
713,Jimmy A,Korean BBQ,5.0,Very good restaurant!,We were there with 13 guys. We ordered a mix of meat and fish and that was very good. The people were very friendly and gave us good information about the menu's. We've been twice now!,Korean BBQ,1
714,Polymath59,Korean BBQ,4.0,Great Korean food that you barbecue at the table,"Although it is an electric bbq in the centre of the table, this is still a great experience. Good menu with choices with selections for two that was adequate for three of us. Food comes raw and you cook it yourself to your liking. The grill is changed regularly so you don’t have to deal with burnt scraps. Although the waiter was attentive in that respect, they were a bit slow with us having to ask to clear the table, ask for the dessert menu, ask to order our dessert and then ask for the bill only to have go to the counter to pay in order to get our taxi. However, would still recommend that you give it a try.",Korean BBQ,1
715,VeniVediAmavi_185,Korean BBQ,5.0,Fantastic find - thanks to Tripadvisor!,"If it wasn’t for the reviews of this place we wouldn’t have tried it.

Looks not a lot from the exterior but the whole experience of having your own personal BBQ on you table to the delicious meats you can try it was absolutely fantastic, definitely worth a visit if looking for something different!

We booked a table for around 4pm which in our opinion was a great time, not too busy and you didn’t feel rushed. staff were very helpful and even called us a taxi to the Playhouse after our meal, which was fantastic and saved us a very wet walk through the city.

If you are looking for something different from a chain restaurant and a little taste of Korean Food then definitely take a trip here - you’ll love it!",Korean BBQ,1

Great ribeye, short rib and marinated fillet. Accompanying pickled veg was excellent. Lots of soft fluffy rice. The chilli paste was very tasty as well.

If you like Korean and you love BBQ beef then give it a go. Value for money for four people.",Korean BBQ,1
720,Zoelss,Korean BBQ,4.0,A fun dining experience,"I have been twice now and both times ordered a set of mixed meats, set D I believe, to bbq. Out of this the sliced beef is defiantly the best! The goyzas are also yummy.

Unlike when I have had Korean BBQ in Asia, here there are no extractors above the tables which does lead to a slightly smokey atmosphere and you defiantly leave smelling of a garlic-y bbq.
But all in all, a great find for some fun and tasty food.",Korean BBQ,1
721,Antronkzo,Korean BBQ,4.0,Last minute bookinh,"After a colleague recommmeded this restaurant we decided to chance our luck with a last minute booking for seven of us.
The staff were very friendly and accommodating and fitted us in.
At our table we opted for a couple of mixed meat cook at table bbq dishes and all the meat was great! This was more than enough for four of us. The other three opted for their own dishes which also looked very appetising!
Great little find and I’m sure I’ll be back!",Korean BBQ,1
722,Sothea45,Korean BBQ,2.0,Very disapointed,We went to this restaurant thanks to tripadvisor recommandations but we were very disapointed by the food. We ordered 2 C set (beef bbq for 2 people) and the quantity was very small. Plus the food was not very tasty... We were forced to have another D set (mixed meat for 2). This time there was enough quantity for 2 but the quality was not there... To conclude i would not recommend it. It was also a bit expensive.,Korean BBQ,0
723,Nan K,Korean BBQ,4.0,Something different,"Ate here before the theatre..a random week night in chilly Edinburgh at 6.00...no need to book, I thought. Well, as they had online booking decided I might as well and, although there was one free table, it looks like booking was a wise decision. It’s a small, cozy space with friendly staff who talked us through the menu as we had never eaten in a Korean restaurant before. Prawn starter was magnificent and easily enough for two, followed by the Korean BBQ, neatly fitted into the table top. A decent bottle of reasonably priced house wine...what’s not to like?",Korean BBQ,1
724,steadyslack,Korean BBQ,4.0,Smokey,"The smell which hits you as you walk through the door is similar to that of teriyaki which makes your mouth water!
We opted for bbq and ordered a set of mixed meats and also sliced beef accompanied by goyzas both chicken and vegetables plus an aubergine.
The bbq grill is electric and we felt was never sizzlingly hot (like in Asia where they are mostly gas powered). There are no extractors over the tables therefore the whole place is really smokey with 12 grills on the go! Your clothes will whiff.
The service was a little sporadic.
All in all pretty good for somewhere out of Asia.",Korean BBQ,1

730,Thistly_Cross,Korean BBQ,5.0,"Great quality, friendly vibe, stunning side salads!","Second visit here. Tuesday night and it's packed!
Last time, we got a BBQ for two, and starters, we only just managed to eat all this!!

This time, I opted for a stew, my ptnr went for some sort of spicy chicken thing, and we had dumpling starters and a kumchi side.

As last time, we got three different salads that came with the food, free refills of same which we made use of. Dressings in salad all different but are lovely sweet/sour/salty combos, go with everything!

Lots of Korean diners, and other folk who know their stuff, but I think you would be well looked after if you hadn't a clue - staff checked we were ok both visits, and checked if we wanted chopsticks or knife fork spoon.

Be aware that in common with many Korean restaurants, your clothes and hair will smell after!! Don't wear anything like a doen jacket that needs special cleaning.

We recently went to another, new, Korean bbq in Edinburgh but this place totally outguns it! 2 starters, 2 mains, side salads come with it, and we got a drink each, £40 total.",Korean BBQ,1

The restaurant itself is not too big, but looks cozy. We tried 2 different kind of ramens, some kimchi, and korean green tea latte. The drink was amazing, the food even better! Their tempura is so tasty, I keep telling my man to go back to get more.
I would definitely recommend!",Korean BBQ,1
732,535family,Korean BBQ,5.0,Great food and lovely service,"We had the Korean BBQ (menu D) for 2 people with 2 beers each and more than we could eat, all for under £50. The waiters were so friendly and helpful showing us how to use the BBQ and talking us through all the pickles and seasoning. The food was absolutely delicious and the Korean Beer was good too. At the end the staff called us a taxi - they couldn’t do enough to help. The only thing to note is that it was cash only so make sure you take enough cash with you but definitely go! Also it really would be hard for vegetarians.",Korean BBQ,1
733,Madeline R,Korean BBQ,5.0,"Always tasty, great atmosphere!","My friends and I are regulars at KBBQ and although their normal dishes are very good, we love the Korean barbeque the most. It's super fun to cook the meat yourself, although if you're nervous the staff will jump in to help, or cook it for you if you prefer. Even as a group of students we find we can all leave full and happy for around £10-20 per person depending on how greedy we are about the meat selection! A great place to spend some quality time with friends or family and enjoy crazy tasty food all the while.",Korean BBQ,1
734,paulines826,Korean BBQ,5.0,"Great Service, Great Food","The waiter was very informative and would recommend their bbq. We paid just under £60 with drinks, bbq and two meals with a starter which is fairly good. I would recommend booking it as the place is quite small.",Korean BBQ,1
735,Patricia Y,Korean BBQ,5.0,Great food and service,"First visit and our family of four adults came as part of an evening out in Edinburgh to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday. The menu is varied - for both carnivores and vegetarian options. We tried the barbeque at the table - and this added to the experience as well as the flavor- with staff attentive and helpful, to make sure the food was prepared properly- cooked well but not singed and smokey. Marinades flavoursome with just the right amount of bite and side veg dishes crispy and tastey. We had dumplings and seaweed salad to start. Finished with black sesame ice cream I have travelled in Asia and experienced authentic local dishes and this was on par.
Smiling staff and service was great. We will definitely return- would be good for a light lunch or as we had- a full evening meal.",Korean BBQ,1

They offer different BBQ sets which are really good value for money and they have Chamisul soju which is my personal favourite.

739,dug289,Korean BBQ,5.0,Absolutely outstanding!,"This place is amazing, to say the least. We'd never been to a Korean bbq before so didn't know what to expect, but what a great experience it was and we had such a great time. we ordered beef slices, king prawns, seaweed, two portions of rice and two grape juices; all of this coming with free sides and sauces. The beef and prawns were beautifully marinated and the staff was very helpful in showing us how to cook as it was our first time. The rice was excellent and the seaweed was as well (despite not liking it much myself). Would highly recommend getting the grape juice as well if you're looking for something non-alcoholic, tasted great and even had little grapes inside the can which added to the experience of a different culture. Overall, I must say that this place is a true wonder, with a great variety of food, friendly staff and excellent little details such as the metal chopsticks and drinks being served in their original can/bottle covered in Korean/Japanese writing; and for a very filling meal we only spent £30.",Korean BBQ,1

It was super busy with no available tables on the moment we went, but waiter kindly asked us to wait for 10-15 minutes. Finally we got our table and happily ordered beef bbq set for two. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with lots of little additional dishes as in South Korea does, but one has to order for extra fee. Our bulgogi tasted well, but it wasn’t that authentic though. For me the highlight was kimchi, that tasted very different from packaged ones. Waiters were quick and polite, thumbs up for them. Also it felt a bit expensive for what you get. Oh, and bare in mind your clothes will be soaked with smelly smoke for days, as everyone is grilling it’s own meat and there are no smoke extractors, unfortunately.",Korean BBQ,0

We also got an order of Kim, Kimchi and Hot Beef Soup to share. We loved it all. The beef selection came with three types and they gave us three sides/lettuce/sesame oil with salt and chili paste. All were YUMMM. I had to order white rice as it doesn't come with the order, which from other places I've been to globally that was weird. My water glass came out with food on it, which was gross, but the server replaced it. We asked for a pitcher of water, but that never came. When it came time to pay it was hard to get a server and the restaurant at this point was not full. I would recommend the food and would go back for the food but the service could do a bit better.

Green Tea Ice cream was yummm and on point to what we had in Japan.",Korean BBQ,1

After a rough day of pulling suitcases up and down hills to get to our hotel, we had a delicious meal at this place. Food tasted fresh, staff was friendly and place was very clean. The only down side to this place and why I gave 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because they only took cash on the day we went. Not sure if this is a usual thing but they at least knew where the closest ATM machine was. Overall great place would definitely recommend it and would go back if we ever returned.",Korean BBQ,1
754,bblue88,Korean BBQ,3.0,"Okay, but a bit bland","A nice atmosphere and good to see a Korean BBQ in Edinburgh this concept has potential if the food improves. Food was edible and pleasant enough, but I feel the chicken dish I ordered was miss sold by the waitress, she warned me the dish I ordered was very spicy, however, it was actually tasteless and bland not a hint of flavour or spice in my opinion.
Also the side dishes weren't very authentic and options to buy more sides were very limited e.g the only noodle option is udon.
If you're looking for good Korean in Edinburgh I'd recommend sodaeng as the best. Hope Korean BBQ is able to improve on authentic Korean flavours as I liked the look and feel of this restaurant.",Korean BBQ,1

757,baronynine,Korean BBQ,1.0,Cash Only,"Book a table well in advance, get e- mail confirmation.

Take train into Edinburgh, travel light with cash for a few beers, card to pay for meal.

Go see a Festival show in George Street and then 15 minute walk up to Tarvit Street.

Table ready for us, sit down handed menus, all good so far.

Just about to order and the wife spots the ""cash only"" sign at the till at the back of the restaurant. We ask the waitress if it was indeed cash only and she says ""network was down"".

Only have card with me so we have to sheepishly leave the restaurant.

Fair enough that the network was down (a first for me) but surely they could have emailed or phoned us to let us know?

As the Festival was on everywhere was full so had to head back to the train station hungry

759,GarethClaase,Korean BBQ,5.0,"Great food, value and staff","Tiny bit off the main thoroughfare, and the frontage I think conceals a bit that the interior is really quite nice, but not to be missed.

Korean bbq is great because there's nothing like cooking the meat yourself then popping it in your mouth while it's still toasty hot. Vegetables also cook nicely too.

Staff were charming and very attentive. Nice touch that the chef popped out to check on everyone. Really surprised at the bill given how much meat we ate. We didn't drink much but it still felt good value.

We had the assorted meats bbq, and it was all great. Marinaded strips of beef were particularly nice. Will look forward to bulgolgi and bibimbap next time (other Korean specialties).

We couldn't eat everything, and they suggested themselves that we just cook up the rest and take it home. I often wish I could do that at restaurants but I'm too embarrassed to ask.",Korean BBQ,0

Its a normal Korean bbq where you cook your own meat at the table but the staff gave great tips on the best way to do it. Great sauces and side dishes to go with the meat as well.

766,Daniel M,Korean BBQ,5.0,Closest thing to Korea in Scotland,"Visited with some friends recently after we'd all come back from working in South Korea and were missing the food.

Stepping inside and first getting that aroma we felt instantly back in Busan!

First off the staff were incredibly friendly and took loads of time to speak to us and were always on hand with anything we needed - even showing the correct way to make a so-maek (?)

The food was outstanding and I honestly don't think you'll find a better representation of the BBQ atmosphere of Korean restaurants in Scotland, or even the rest of the UK for that matter.

We had the assorted meat platter with some soup and it was plenty for 4. We also got some kimchi and again it's much better than you can buy in the shops.

No Korean night out would be complete without some Hite and some Soju and thankfully they have both ;o)

All in all we had a great night there due to a combination of fantastically attentive staff
And delicious food all in a great relaxed atmosphere.

As soon as you enter, it smells so so good. Unfortunately very few vegetarian options and the 2 courses that I ordered were very ok for the price they were at. A special mention to the staff. They were so good. Great service, made us feel so comfortable and were always keeping a check in case we weren't sure about the BBQ. The chef had also come out once to check the bbq.

BBQ was excellent and very reasonably priced. You can get just pork or beef or a mixed one. We got the mixture of pork, beef, chicken and came with 2 beers for £38. The experience and the meat itself was fantastic especially the sauces and the pickled vegetables- the marinated chicken and beef bulgogi were devine. If you're on the Atkins diet no danger here as the meats and vegetables are plentiful with no carbs in sight

Would highly recommend",Korean BBQ,1
770,jon0269,Korean BBQ,4.0,Great Korean right next to the King's Theatre,"We went here for lunch just a few minutes after it opened at 12 so we were the first in. Friendly welcome, quick service, tasty Korean food. Worth a visit.",Korean BBQ,1
771,Nimes F,Korean BBQ,5.0,Great dining experience,"Like some other comments, I experienced a Korean BBQ whilst in Tokyo many many years ago, and have wanted to experience it again but have been unable to find one in Scotland. I then found the Korean BBQ on the tripadvisor website and immediately visited.
I ordered a mixed meat set meal. The waiter suggested that this was a 3 person serving but since there were 2 of us, they would pack the remainder for take-away.

The mixed meat plater is accompanied by an array of side dishes from salad leaves to chilli paste. The platter itself held many differently marinaded cuts of meat (chicken pork and beef) All raw for you to cook yourself on the bbq grill situated in the centre of the table.

The meats were delicious and as we did not finish, the waiter packed up the remaining uneaten cook meats. We accompanies the meal with korean beer which was the perfect match.

For the uninitiated, this as a really fun way to dine, and something everone should try. It can get busy at the usual eating times so booking is advised. We ate after the lunchtime rush so was easy to get a table. I've already made a reservation for next Saturday and looking forward to it.
One last interesting point, the bbq meal consists of meats and veg so a carb free option, making it both delicious and healthy. A seafood option is available also.

Check it out, you will love it.",Korean BBQ,1
772,ScotsGlobeTrotters,Korean BBQ,5.0,Fabulous authentic food and love staff - will be rushing back!,"The staff greeted us warmly checking if we eaten at the restaurant and / or Korean food before...No and Yes. They asked if we needed help with the menu and also brought out complimentary sides which are also refilled for free which is a wonderful idea....not just because they're complimentary but because they tasted divine!!
It was my mum's first time eating Korean food and now recognises there was no need for apprehension. Every morsal was heavenly - our only disappointment was it was a light pre theatre dinner and we wanted to try more. 1st rate kimchi, salads are so flavoursome, the hot pot was amazing and katsu curry spot on.
I can't wait to come back for a full on bbq feast and try lots more. And its such an important note, the staff were friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there which is so refreshing. A real gem of a restaurant",Korean BBQ,1
773,Sarah M,Korean BBQ,4.0,Perfect pre-theatre Asian food,"My son and I visited after his ortho appointment for a lunch treat. I'm on a low-carb diet just now and have to be a picky eater. Korean BBQ was perfect as they brought suitable nibbles, then I had a pork belly kim chi soup with a side of rice (we took away) which was satisfyingly spicy and delicious. My son had chicken katsu (his favourite) and rice and said it was really good.
Service was lovely, small business, chef/owner, and great decor. Very reasonable price.
This little place is tucked at the side of the King's Theatre and so easy to miss, but don't. This food is perfect for pre-theatre as it's not heavy and so less likely to induce that post-supper soporific state so fatal in a darkened theatre space...
Definitely returning to do the whole BBQ thing.",Korean BBQ,1

780,Prism11,Korean BBQ,4.0,"Good flavor, not perfect","BBQ'd meats were delicious (we had the squid and pork). Not rating this a 5 due to mediocre starters and lack of traditional banchan (all the small plates that typically come with a Korean meal). We were also asked if we wanted rice, which I found strange since that's expected with a traditional meal. Service was nice and expedient. Would still gladly return for the delicious flavor of the BBQ!",Korean BBQ,1
781,GyNLff,Korean BBQ,5.0,"Great quality and experience, is a must!","We went there because we already knew about the Korean Barbeque, and when we saw it walking around the area we thought to come and try it, and it was an amazing success.

We ordered a Seafood pancake, Chicken Gyoja, a Kimchi side (to try it since it is something typical from Korea) and the Mo Dum Gu I (Assorted meat bbq selection). Everything was really good. The seafood pancake was nothing special, but it was nice and tasty, more pancake flavour than seafood, but it was nice overall. The chicken gyoja were really nice, the Kimchi side is something you have to try at least once, and it was something spicy, crunchy, fresh and with a lot of flavour, even though is a side measure, it is quite a nice portion, so keep in mind if you just want to try it. And the best for us was the Mo Dum Gu (we got the Assorted meat bbq menu that includes salads), it comes with 2 sauces, one spicy and delicious and another of sesame that it was also really good, also comes with lettuce to make wraps (and when we ran out of lettuce they brought us more without charging for it), it also comes with some salads to fill your wraps or eat them alone, delicious, spicy and tasty. And the meat selection is top notch, everything was really nice but our favourites were the Pork neck slice and the Darkgalbi, both of them marinated. It includes also 2 beers or 2 soft drinks, but as we were ordering a bottle of wine, Pinot Grigio Veneto, we didn't ordered them. They brought to us some special radish to taste and include in the wraps for free, it was really good and it fits perfectly with the pork belly wraps.

Since it was rather late and we were quite full we decided not to order any dessert but we will do for sure the next time.

The waitress and the waiter were friendly, helpful and professional, they didn't step in too much in our table and we didn't have to wait for anything, they were really attentive and smiling.

Since we had a lot of food with sauces and we were eating slow, we got replaced our grills twice, but it was made with the best of the attitude and they were not intrusive or disturbing at all.

The experience was amazing, we will come back for sure and try other dishes and desserts.

As recommendation for the staff, you could put a sign on the corner of the street to make more noticeable your place, because you deserve all the possible attendance and success.

Cheers!

We went early on opening (5pm) and very soon after we could see how popular this place is with young couples.

I have tried a few Korean restaurants in Edinburgh and this place is actually good.
Ordered three dishes and all of them are really tasty. We(two of us) cleared all of them. Fine dishes! Loved it. I gave 4 stars for two reasons: 1. Parking can be a nightmare 2.Price is slightly higher than other restaurants. Am I going back? For sure!

794,Madfortripad89,Korean BBQ,1.0,This restaurant does NOT cater to dietary requirements,"We had a very disappointing evening here. I have to follow a gluten-free diet and my friend stated in advance in her email booking that there would be two people who had to eat gluten free. The menu online also says that dietary requirements should be made clear to the waiters.

When we were ordering we asked the waiter which of the dishes could be made gluten free and which dishes should be avoided. The waiter did not know what gluten free meant and what wheat was when we tried to describe the dietary requirement. He made some suggestions from the banquet menu but could not confirm whether any of the sauces in the dishes contained gluten-ingredients which was very worrying.

We ended up having to order boiled rice and edamame means as we could not take the risk of having an allergic reaction. I would advise anyone with any dietary issues to avoid this restaurant as nobody seemed to follow through on the claim that they could accommodate dietary requirements.",Korean BBQ,1

THis is a good place for friends to sit down, chill and cook out.
The place is average, decor does not add a feel of being in an Asian food place.
Service is ok, they do help other customers who are new to table top grill experience.
The food is satisfying, especially since it's been a long time since we've had some grilled meat on the table. But I would say I've had better in the past. Also, there were only three side dishes. In authentic Korean restaurants, they provide about 5 or more with unlimited refills.

I was so pleased I chose here because everyone was very impressed with the food and the atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing. The interior has a contemporary design feel.
We went for the barbecue at your table option and cooked the meat ourselves which was good fun and made for an inclusive experience as we fought for control of the tongs and argued over who was to be chef.
We had the Sam Gyup Sal ( 3 layered pork) , Doe Ji Bulgogi( marinated pork) , So Bulgogi ( marinated beef), Saeng galbi (beef ribs) and Doenjang jjigae ( traditional stew). It was all excellent, particularly the meat I cooked ㅎㅎ. I would particularly recommend the Sam Gyup Sal which was a really flavoursome piece of meat.
Service was efficient and friendly and for me the bill was very reasonable.
I am looking forward to visiting again and trying some different dishes.",Korean BBQ,1
800,VeBeKay,Korean BBQ,3.0,They could do so much better!,"Been there twice since they've opened and, yes, the food is good (I'd give it 4 stars - points off because my kimchi soup was a bit bland..), but it was so frustrating how the dished appeared with LONG delays for different people...
The first time, it was just two of us, and it was relatively busy, so we thought it's not the end of the world that my boy-friend had already finished his meal before mine appeared (also: he hadn't noticed that he had to order rice with his meal and this also wasn't pointed out by the waiter... by the time we noticed this, the waiter was nowhere to be seen, so basically, my bf ate his main course..with some delay also his rice portion.. and then , finally did my course appear).

The same thing happened again the next time we came. We were 4 people then and there was only one other couple in the restaurant, but there was a ~10min lag between everyone's course being brought to the table. Very frustrating! (The fact that the waiter said ""enjoy your meal"" to the first person who got his food and then walked away, kind of implied that he'd better eat before it gets cold, I guess...)

It was generally very hard to get the waiter's attention , he even disappeared to the outside and never looked if we wanted more food/drinks etc.
By the end of the meal, we were sat for 30minutes chatting, but nobody came to actually remove the dirty plates and dishes from us.

I really hope that this place gets its service sorted, because it could be really good if it does...",Korean BBQ,1

They cooked the meat and rice for you, though you can do some of it yourself. That’s one of the beauties of eating like this, the active participation and freshness of the food you get to eat.

This dish is really tasty! There’s vegetables as well and it is saucy with a spicy, sweet, and savoury flavour. It’s difficult to a solo diner here because the portion is massive and I don’t know if they have “to go”.

888,Hashima D,유가네 닭갈비 명동1호점,5.0,Chicken Galbi Goodness!,"Firstly, the staff was very gracious and accommodating.:) They helped us with the menu because we weren't aware of the level of spiciness.

There was a salad bar where you can get the vegetables and kimchi. :)

The meat is as tender and as well-marinated. The level of spiciness is less than moderate, and it is more sweet than spicy actually. It was complemented by the vegetables and kimchi.
The chicken may be the main dish, but we also tried the seafood which was equally amazing and tasty.

Overall, I enjoyed Yoogane because of it's value for money, great dining experience, and the food of course. We came back regularly during our stay in Korea. :)",['dakgalbi'],1

We headed there a little later in the afternoon to miss the lunch crowd. When we got there, there was no queue and a bunch of tables available. GREAT!!! .

The ladies headed over to the restroom but there was a queue. My dad and myself had a seat and looked through the menu. We decided on what we wanted to eat and my mum got back and started looking through the menu.

Here is when our mood was totally killed. My lady wasn't even back yet, and its been no more than 5 minutes. This guy, whom i assume is the Supervisor, cause he was in a different uniform, came up to our table aggressively and raised his voice saying, 'Order NOW, YOU SIT HERE SO LONG'. I explained, my wife is in the toilet, dont worry once shes out we will order'. He shouts, 'NO ORDER NOW' and flings the menu at my 64 year old dad.

Things have clearly already gone out of hand. I tell my parents to pack and i stood up and told him to back off. I was FUMING. This went way too far. If my parents and lady were not there, this would have gone alot worse.

We stood up and left. I am disgusted by this establishment, and would NEVER recommend stepping foot in this horrendous place. Picture of the 'Supervisor' included.",['dakgalbi'],1

The restaurant that claim themselves as Korea's number One chicken Galbi has been in the business since 1981. A narrow entrance and staircase brought us to the second floor of the shop. We waited around 15-20 min at the staircase as they only have around 15-20 tables and no waiting room.

We ordered Marinated Chicken Galbi Fried Rice and the Marinated Chicken Galbi by itself with the addition of extra noodles, rice and cheese. They are cooked in front of us and everyone was given an apron to prevent any spraying from the cooking. Main ingredients were chicken, cabbage, oil and chili . Chili empowering the whole dish, so for some people, the dish might be too strong and spicy but it is very delicious.
Kimchi and other pickles were self served and they are fresh.

Please note that if you're looking for top service then this may not be the correct place for you. It's an establishment to enjoy the atmosphere of the galbi being cooked in front of you.
We waited for about 10/15 minutes and eventually got seated, table still being half cleaned as we sat down. Had a more older waitress waiting us, she tried her best to explain to us how it worked but communication barrier broke down a bit and not to her fault. We chose the standard chicken galbi and ordered additional rice to go with it.
Everything arrived pretty quick and was soon on the fire cooking, the service staff must rotate in the tables since we didn't really see the original waitress again. You're able to stir the ingredients yourself or the staff will come around periodically doing it. Either way, it can be fun so enjoy it.
Once cooked we were asked if we wanted the rice added in as well. Note, the rice is supposed to be added after you've eaten some of it and not added in straight when the cheese, chicken and veg is cooked. The new waiter that's come to our table asked if we wanted, but didn't advise that it should be done after. Only knowing after it was added, its meant to be cooked with the left overs to soak up the remaining flavours on the palate.

The waiter wasn't friendly (or rude) but we were able to order our food and got what we needed. We went after the lunch rush but there were still a lot of diners and it was busy. Our food came shortly and we chatted while waiting for the chicken to be cooked all the way. I thought the food was just average and wasn't spicy enough but my friend who never had Dakgalbi before loved it. We loved dipping our chicken in cheese and the fried rice they made for us at the end. I'm glad my friend enjoyed her meal but I probably won't visit on my own.",['dakgalbi'],0
943,JessDunbar,유가네 닭갈비 명동1호점,1.0,"Terrible service, walked out before ordering!","Never have I ever placed a 1 star review on Tripadvisor, nor walked out of a resturaunt so confused and angry.

Me and my partner went to this restaurant as our first BBQ experience. Small menu, so we tried to order a BBQ chicken dish for 2 people (23000 won) as well as another chicken rice dish (6000 won) as we were so hungry. Was told we could not order both dishes? We didnt understand why this was, so tried to clarify - and our waiter was so rude, treating us like we were stupid. We continually tried saying we wanted both, and was not given a clear explanation as to why we had to choose one or the other. Why is it that your resturaunt would not allow us to spend the extra money for one extra dish?

Also found it odd the treatment of other customers wanting to come in to the restaurant by the man at the front - not even a smile on his face, very abrupt.

Lack of service standards are clearly reflected in many reviews as we found out after exiting the resturaunt and searching it up online.

We ended up walking out without ordering anything, and found a better resturaunt with MUCH better service.",['dakgalbi'],0
944,udubfl,유가네 닭갈비 명동1호점,4.0,Spicy Chicken BBQ! Yummy,"First off, if you are visiting Korea, chicken BBQ (galbi) is one of the must food you must try! So, there's hundreds of restaurants you can go to. So, I would say Yoogane is pretty popular with tourists and locals. It's a chain but they are consistent and good. It's spicy but you can order non-spicy for children or those who don't want spicy.

Like everyone says, they cook the food in front of you so, it does get smelly (but so does every local BBQ joints in Korea). So, cover your jackets with their aprons they provide or put it in a shopping bag if you have them. This helps reduce the after effects :). They have frebreez-type spray by the exit if you can't live with the smell.

I would say it's almost a three course meal. First, your chicken BBQ. You can add whatever you want to make it more customized to your tasting such as cheese, udon noodles, etc. Second course, you order the fried rice, which they take your leftover chicken BBQ and its sauces and mix white rice and other little ingredients. After you get your filling of rice, then you order your third entree, which is Naeg-Mun (cold water noodle). It's has some sweet and vinegar taste. It's a nice way to refresh after the hot and spicy food.

It's nothing fancy but it's a nice way to get some culture and local food. The hard part is finding this place. It's tucked away with all other shops.",['dakgalbi'],1

The menue had an English translation which made it really easy to understand what we were ordering.

Don't skip the fried potstickers - DH said they tasted like the ones in Seoul. He had the bibimbop and said it was delicious. As others mentioned, the place is small with kitchy decor.

Make sure to eat your fill while you're there because Korean food has the tendency to make itself known in the fridge. I've seen some complaints about service, but they operate just like restaurants in Korea do, you've got to tell them you want something, and it'll be on the table in no time flat. The only downside is that I didn't have the stomach to eat everything on the menu, they basically have all of the classics that you could possibly want.

This restaurant was rated as the best Korean food in the Nashville area so we tried it. I had the KimChee soup with beef and Mary had Bulgogi. We were served the traditional little side dishes with our meal and these are always my way of separating the good from the very best. The kim chee itself was on the rather tame side. I did not request the really dilish hot stuff and am sorry I did not. However, it was very good and the soup was outstanding to the last drop and it was served in a huge bowl which I lifted and drained just like I used to do in Korea! The bulgogi was also very good. The service was friendly and helpful and relatively fast and the prices were reasonable. If you want to try Korean food, this is a very good place to do it with good food and a large selection to choose from. I cannot remember the name of the red ""paste"" they always bring in a side dish which looks like ketchup but I can say that it is what stole the show for me here!

The iPhone didn't capitalize Korean new year, but did for Chinese New Year, so I guess not. Anyway, back to Korea House. Located in a strip mall along Charlotte Pike, it's a rather small and unassuming restaurant. We had a party of six and were at immediately, but we also arrived at open. I can see where this place would fill up rather quickly because of the small size.

As my first time here, and I think my first time at a Korean place, I skimmed the pictures on here and got a couple tips from some friends who'd ate here before. I went with the chicken bulgogi ($14.99). I wasn't sure what it was, but the bulgogi seemed like the popular thing on the menu. It came with a bunch of different sides. We had a table of 6, and they brought out two ordered of sides for the table. The portion for the chicken bulgogi was large, it also came with a container of steamed, white rice. I mixed some of the rice in with the main dish and put a little of the sauce from the bottle onto my plate. It was a little spicy, but not insanely spicy. I enjoyed it and would probably get it again if I went back.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

Four of us began with the wonderful seafood pancake accompanied with a sauce the waiter explained to us simply as ""pancake sauce"". Just wonderful. Then we ordered an entree of beef, of shrimp, of pork and the kimchee rice.
We all had to laugh when we received our food. With the companion dishes that come with any entree order, we had covered every inch of our table with various dishes and sauces. I won't list everything we ordered (previous reviewers have listed their own favorites) but it was all good, and some great (especially the seafood pancake).

When I arrived on the scene Joe was seated and I told him as I sat down that it was my first time, not only at Korea House, but also to try Korean food. His immediate response was that he assumed I'd been there with his cousin, Judy, also an advertising vet and dear buddy of mine. The place was shabby chic. Populated by diners who were largely seemingly Korean. A Korean TV station was on the screens. Followed Joe's lead and ordered the #16. Dolsot Bibimbap - rice topped with vegetables and beef bits and a fried egg in a hot stone pot. When our dishes arrived on he table they were literally sizzling. The waitress with a beautiful smile had brought us small dishes of assorted additions to mix into our stone pots. We mixed and blended. The results were a delicious cacophony of flavors. Have to confess, upon entry I was a bit worried. Glad I followed Joe's lead with #16. Just really great! Going back for sure. Thanks, Joe for introducing me to Korea House! Totally enjoyed!

I order the bimbimbap with beef, which comes with all the classic Korean side accompaniments. It comes out served in a hot stone or clay pot so that the bottom of the rice gets extremely crispy- which makes it absolutely delicious. Another staple we normally get is the beef ribs - they come with scallions and a wonderful sauce on a hot plate. I absolutely love their house made hot sauce - it is like a Korean style Sirachai- sooo good. The only things we haven't been huge fans of were the seafood pancake and the tripe soup. The seafood pancake was almost inedible because it was so fishy tasting. Even with having a few dishes we would never order again, the food is consistently pretty good. Service is ok- its not fine dining or even like a regular restaurant. The set up is a little cramped style but is normally full because its probably the best Korean in Nashville.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

Tables sit as close together as possible and you can sit side by side in the center section. I love it. Authentic cuisine and native language customers make this diner a fun, wonderful place. The smells emitting from the kitchen are full of spice and flavor before you even taste it.
All the dishes I see make my mouth water. I'm having the fried dumplings and the Galbi, pork short ribs. I'm writing this as I wait. Any time I get around good food I get excited. There is nothing better than being able to enjoy wonderful cuisine in a relaxing speed. Food does not need to be hurried and this one is not.
Fried dumplings are perfect. Small enough to be bite size, crispy and flavorful.
Conversation and someone to share with might make it better, but my love affair with the food here kinda puts that on the back burner.
Main meal arrived. Eight sides and a big platter of meat. It's hard to start. The kimchi varieties, tofu, potatoes, ribs, just so good.
It has taken me a few, but I'm back to finish this up. Sides are never ending, always a bonus when they are good.

Because we travel to Nashville several times a year we asked around and were directed to Korea House. The first thing I noticed when walking into the small restaurant was the amount of Korean people having dinner. Good sign if you are looking for authentic Korean food! Second thing I noticed was how well worn everything was (in a nice homey way), another good sign to me. We ordered bulgogi (one chicken, one beef) and dolsot bibimbap. The food is amazingly good, so flavorful and spicy! The sides were great, I especially love the kimchi and the bean sprouts. Our server mixed the bibimbap for us and it was perfect. We will continue to frequent Korea House whenever we are in Nashville as the food is great. ***On a side note, the first time we visited the server we had (a young woman) was not very nice, she was almost hostile for some reason. We ordered three meals so we could share a little of each and take the rest back with us to eat over the next couple of days (unless my teen son gets hungry...then it is one meal). She had the nerve to look at us and say ""That's a lot of food..."" and just stood there. So what? We were paying for it so why the concern? The second time our server was an older woman and she was awesome! Couldn't have asked for a better sever. She sealed the deal for us as we had planned to look elsewhere if the service had been as poor as it had been the first time. She brought us boxes for our leftover food and didn't bat an eye when we ordered three meals :)","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

So, we split the tab and he has me rung up as $18. And then when I hand him my card he quickly adds to it to make it $29 and then changes my friend's to $18, so quickly you wouldn't even know it, without saying a word.

These people are rude, if not criminal.

I let it go as a 'mistake' but it's grown on me I felt the need to put in a negative review it's upset me so much.

It's old Korean man who works there at the register. I should have refused but it's only $10 but the more I think about it the more angry I become because he did it so purposely and so blatantly and then, of course, doesn't understand english.

I do not recommend, this was practically criminal. The food was okay, the younger woman is nice. There's some old lady, probably the man's wife, who came up without saying a word and just flung the food down on the table.

We forgot that they put out complimentary appetizers and that is why we had too much food. There were about six small plates with different things. Really liked the potato, the fish and stayed away from the kimchi. Its too hot for us.
My daugter ordered a beef dish and I ordered the chicken fried rice. I did't try hers but she liked it and I liked my dish. I definitely would recommend giving this restaurant a try.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

A bulgogi bi bim bop is home cooking to me (and I am not by any stretch of the imagination Korean). I've had bad Korean food, and am not universally accepting of the genre. This is not bad Korean food. This is seriously delicious Korean food. The ban chan are like little gems set in front of you to sample and enhance your meal, and they make their own kimchi too. It's perfect on the hot-sour meter as far as I'm concerned. The only thing this place does not have (which I wouldn't expect them to) that I miss are soju cocktails. If you've had soju cocktails with the easy pour spout and the deceptively tiny glasses, you know what I mean. Otherwise love these welcoming, happy people and the food they make!!!","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
1066,anonymousfortwayne,Korea House,5.0,Really delicious,"A hidden gem in Nashville and a place for authentic Korean food. We were visiting for the week and found this place on Yelp. Bulgogi was tender and juicy beef barbecue cooked with onions and scallions and eaten with white rice. The bibimbop is a dish with pickled carrots, radishes, lettuce, barbecue beef, egg, mushrooms, bean sprouts, and a hot and sweet sauce. It was beautiful and delicious. The seafood pancake (pajon) was really good--- thick, aromatic, crispy, with a tangy sauce, and small pieces of shrimp and squid in the pancake. The soondubujige, a seafood stew, was gobbled up by the family. All the dishes are served with small side dishes including kimchee, bean sprouts, tempura, omelettes, radishes, and cucumbers. Definitely recommend this place.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

We lived for two years in Korea and the food at Korea House is better than we got there. We always get the fried dumplins. Wonderful and gone in a flash! Then we order the Bulgoggi. It comes with lots of little side dishes. You put the meat on a lettuce leaf, add the red sauce, some steamed rice, and shredded radish. YUM! This is the national dish of Korean and it is GREAT! Then we also get Kimchee fried rice - spicy and tasty. And Chop Cha. This is a noodle dish that has meat and veggies. It is lots of food, but you will want to taste it all and if there is any left take it home for later. Everyone that we have taken here loves it! It is in a strip mall.

1079,kacee692019,I Love Korea,3.0,Disappointed - Portion size and to go orders,"While the food is good to the taste, the serving sizes are comical. They are VERY stingy with serving size. Also, if I dine in for lunch and get the lunch plate you get 3 sides BUT if get a lunch plate to go, you ONLY get 2 sides and again the portion size is not enough to have for the entire meal. Sides should be the same REGARDLESS to whether I dine in or take out! Also, yesterday (14 MAR 19) I ordered a plate to go and asked how much for a side of reddish and the size (because the last time I got the little plastic condiment size container for my sides, so I wanted to know if I paid for extra what size would it be. I was told the ounce size...IT WAS NO. Waiter tried to compensate by saying he FILLED the container to full for me - well DUH. Why should it not be full? Especially as small as it was - not my ounce for the price! I fully intend to speak to management my next visit. Times are too hard for us to pay for such small portions. We expect and demand better from American style establishments and ALL should be held to the same standard. UNACCEPTABLE.

I had not been there recently so I was unaware if any changes had been made. As I entered the parking lot I noticed that the main business sign still prominently displayed "" Sushi Bar "". I went in and was immediately seated as there were not many customers. I was given a menu and no sushi was on it. I asked a server and was told they did not do sushi anymore. As it was lunch I did not have time to go elsewhere so I ordered a spicy chicken box. The chicken was passable but I've had much better at other Korean or Vietnamese restaurants in town. The accompanying dishes were for the most part not very good. No sauce was served with the stuffed dumpling as you usually see. Service was okay but nothing was making up for the false advertising and mediocre food. You can get much better Korean at a better lunch price at several places in Huntsville. As I left I took another look at the sign to make sure I wasn't crazy. Nope, it still said "" Sushi Bar ""","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae']",0

The meat was precooked, too salty and tasted like chucks of something burnt.
Rice was good. Miso soup was good. Fried pot stickers were good.
Pan-chan - kimchi was good. Thinly sliced vinegar radish were good. Other stuff were not.

I got the bugogli (beef) lunch box. my co-worker got the chicken wing box, with a side of beef.

Unsure why my co-worker could get the chicken wing box with a side of beef, when I couldn't get the beef box, with a side of chicken... was the same food. but, what I got was really tasty and flavorful.
the beef could've been a bit more hot - semi-luke warm, but still not bad.

we got there when they opened at 11, and within 20minutes the place was nearly packed.

I had the chicken bibimbop in the stone pot and it was excellent. It came out sizzling hot from the kitchen and the miso soup is some of the best i've had.

The Gal bi was too salty and not as tender as we are use to.

The Champong was a bit too oily but had a pretty good flavor.

The spicy pork ( California Rolls ) were very good. The server was nice except for the fact that he didn't come to check on us for refills of sides.

When we walked in we were greeted immediately and seated in the ""party section"" in the back. They were very busy so this didn't bother us at all; we were just happy to get a seat that fast. We looked at the menu and our waiter was taking our order in less than 2 minutes. I ordered the Bulgogi Lunch Box and my husband ordered the rice dish with Bulgogi and a fried egg on top (I don't remember exactly what it was called). We received our miso soup and then our little side dishes of kimchi, radish, etc. very quickly. The food was great. The soup was served hot, with the little tofu pieces, and the side dishes were exactly what we expected. When I received my lunch box I was impressed because it looked and smelled amazing. My husband received his food about 3-4 minutes later. Because we didn't receive our food at the same time, we never got a check to go pay (we had to relay what we ordered to the cashier at the front), and also because the women next to us ordered some soup that smelled so bad (like hot blue cheese) that it was VERY hard to continue to eat our lunch without getting sick; I've decided to give them 4 stars instead of 5.

I Love Korea has very good sushi, but the made to order meals are not as good to me as the buffet at Korea House at the times I visited in 2013. The sushi is a good value, but the lunch menu is a bit pricey for me, especially if I order a side of sushi. If I recall correctly lunch with a side order of sushi was around $16, and that is with a water, tip not included.

I have been back and just had the sushi a couple of times and it is always sooo gooood and fresh.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae']",1

1118,SunnyFLovr,I Love Korea,4.0,Diamond in the rough,"I am always looking for good sushi. I found this one by word of mouth and must say they know sushi.
The building used to be a Japanese Restaurant. The outside although a bit rough opens up to a nice interior where you feel welcome. There is a sushi bar at the 'front' and we opted for that as I was a guest of another Korean friend. The selections were traditional but the presentation was spot on! Portions seemed larger than your typical restaurant and the chef was desirous to show us his work - we had about 11 varieties, each was well done. I left full. There is a mizo soup to start you off while you wait, but the wait was not long at all. Staff was helpful and attentive.
I did not get to sample their other meal options, but will be back to do so. I can only give 4 stars till I try the rest. Dinner time is great time to go, as there were open seats, but over half full on the night we visited.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae']",1

Common allergens (ie eggs, nuts) are specified on menu, which gimchi chigae has but not for the side dishes. I couldn’t change the dish. If this had been told to me prior, I would ask first whether I could change. If not, I’d order something else. I ended paying for something I couldn’t eat.
Also, I ended up with gimbap without tuna despite ordering tuna gimbap on my first takeaway with the restaurant. Money wasted there.

The food is amazing! It seems to be authentic, and some dishes are very spicy (hot, but delicately seasoned). The menu ranges from classic bibimbap and udon noodles, to various gimgap and sweet potato noodles.

And we can not certify if is authentic Korean food. What we can say that it tasted very good. The service was also nice, no personal touch but fast and professional.

Both dishes were served with a side of kimchi and my Bulgogi Bibimbap also came with a clear soup. Both dishes were extremely tasty and my boyfriend even joked about asking for the recipe as it was that good and he wanted us to make it back at home.

They accept Visa and they do carry out. I took our food to go and while I had to wait about 15 minutes for our food I imagine that had I called in my order it would have been ready when I got there.

In a city not known for strong customer service they accommodated my requests for sauce on the side for one dish and less spicy on my daughter’s.

What I liked:

1) the food is just so good and reasonably priced. You get authentic Korean food (I was told by friends who lived in Korea), it's well-prepared and presented.
2) The service is very good. I was impressed with the waitresses, they are kind, respectful & speak English, three characteristics that are hard to find in Prague (sorry to say that, they don't have customer service skills here). I was personally served by a blonde one (I'm sorry, I don't know her name). Despite I ordered something but I meant something else, she immediately went to the kitchen and got me what I wanted, literally in 5 minutes. Thank you so much!
3) Restaurant is nice, good atmosphere, clean.
4) Owners are really nice. I had the chance to have a chat with the owner, a Korean woman who is really nice.

We hadn't eaten Korean before, so didn't know what to expect - we tried Korean ginger tea which was delicious, and then my partner had the tradition soup to start followed by a tray of pork and rice etc. It looked amazing.

I recommend to book a table a day in advance. In the evenings it's almost impossible to find a free table prior booking.

1217,Nik H,비빔밥코리아 프라하,3.0,Nice authentic food@terrible service,"I/we have visited the place twice in the past month. One was a quick lunch (the place does not offer any special lunch menu) and the other was what was to be a decent birthday celebration. Food is great in terms of its variety, authenticity, and freshness. Other reviews testify to this, show you pics etc so no need to delve in detail on this. The service is, however, problematic. The lunch experience was below average, service-wise, in terms of attentiveness etc but since the place was pretty empty, it was bearable. However, the birthday celebration on Friday night occassion with a place having being completely packed revealed and amplified this general problem. The staff was very nervous as a line of guests waited inside and outside the restaurant demanding to be seated. Afyer being seated, I had to leave the table three times - first to ask for the menu card (after 20 minutes waiting and not seeing anyone to come and say even hello), second to ask where our soup was after another 30 mins of nothing happening after i brought a waiter with me to the table, and, third, the same with our main course somehow not making it to our table, again, after 30mins, with soup balls still on table!!! Next tables were not served any better but the international crowd of youngsters seemed to be patient if dissatisfied too. Additionally, the right side of the restaurant was very cold and we kept our winter jacket on at times. BOTTOM LINE: I Will give it a third chance as we live nearby but if the service is not substantially improved i will go elsewhere then. There is another jap-korean restaurant nearby (wont identify not to be blamed for favouring it) which, albeit more expensive, provides top service.",['bibimbap'],0

1220,Daehyeon K,비빔밥코리아 프라하,5.0,Best restaurant in Praha for me,"Bibimbap Korea is valuable Korean restaurant in Europe. It serves original Korean food and it is really amazing that I can eat real Korean food here. It is definitely different from other Korean restaurant in other European countries. I study in Netherlands and I tried many already in other already but they are frequently poor. However, this place use fresh ingredients and think much about the food.

Some of food was much better than Korea!! If you are beginner of Korean food, try Kimchi Bok-eum-bap or Bibimbap or Dosirak menu. I think Cham-ppong is one of the best dish here but it will be too spicy for beginner. Anyway I think most of the dishes here deserves the price.

You can see many foreigners and local people who is eating Korean food. When I visited here, more than 90% were non-Korean and 70% were non-Asian. If you have enough budget, try this restaurant. You won't regret! Oh! and the servers can speak not only English but also Korean quite well. You can see servers are talking with Korean owner in Korean language.

We took Ramen and Bibimbap (a) with set of suchi

Ramen was big and very very hot, noodles in it were very simple and without any special taste (looked like the cheapest fast food noodles), BUT it was spicy, thanks for that!

Bibimbap wasn't tasty at all....we both didn't like it.

We went for lunch and ordered Bibimbap, Pajeon, and bulgogi kimbap. The restaurant's signature dish was delicious - on par with what you'd find in Korea! Flavorful, authentic, and chocked-full of various fresh veggies. We also appreciated that it wasn't served too hot. Our pajeon was solid; nice and crispy on the outside and soft inside with delicious bits of green onion and squid. The kimbap, a staple of my diet when I lived in Seoul, was a bit of a letdown. A tad bland and dry, you can see why they didn't name the place ""Kimbap."" The meal wasn't cheap, but not prohibitively expensive either, though I'm used to paying less for similar dishes. The biggest negative of the meal was the lack of side dishes, as well as bland kimchi that seemed 'washed' in attempt to downplay its natural spiciness for the European market.

I'd definitely recommend, but stick to the bibimbap!",['bibimbap'],1

1241,L6G,비빔밥코리아 프라하,4.0,Great Korean food - star down for MSG,"I visited this restaurant with my dad (both of us having on different occasions visited Korea and loved the food) and we were not disappointed. The food was great and authentic. The atmosphere is ok and the gentleman who served us (the owner, their waitress was off at the time) was lovely and helpful. The menu is limited but that's no fault - it means that what you get is really fresh and delicious. Based on this, I'd rate it five star.

However, just as most (if not all...) Korean (or perhaps asian in general) restaurants in Prague, the food contains MSG - and possibly quite considerable amounts. If I had any suspicions, they were confirmed by the sight of the familiar long crystals in the chilli powder mix that I was offered when asked for extra chillies. I was disappointed by this and not surprised - MSG really is very common in countries like Korea and it is almost impossible to get away from there so it's understandable you'd find it here.

My guess is you'd struggle to find Korean restaurant in Prague that avoids MSG and this one is probably as good as it gets :)

One recommendation to the restaurant - get some fresh chillies or Korean chilli sauces to offer those customers who want the real spicy deal",['bibimbap'],1

The food is amazingly delicious, service is prompt and attentive, the staff there are polite and welcoming. The food was served quickly and it was savored by all of us in our group. Wonderfully seasoned, all the foods were the perfect temperature and plenty of drinks to go around.

The host was friendly and checked in on us during dinner a couple of times to be sure we had everything we needed. Wonderful service!

The Service was not very fast but the owner is a very gentle man.

for dinner, the restaurant gets croweded easily, (probably because it is the best in town) but it is well worth the wait.
They would rather make you wait rather than make you sit next to strangers, so for me, it is a plus.

Owners are korean and staff is nice and helpfull. Prices are more than reasonable (150kc for bibimbap), portions generous you will leave satisfied (although spiciness level is probably tailored for locals, as it is not that spicy).

Maybe reading all the excited reviews raised my expectations too high, but what I found in Bibimbap was a nice and rather busy low key and cosy restaurant with friendly staff and almost 'home-like' atmosphere, but the choice of dishes was rather limited and food was a bit bland.

The restaurant was not the easiest to find as it is a 5 min walk from zizkov tower, hidden after a staircase and not so easy to spot; we luckily used this map and eventually found it. We ordered plum tea, lemon tea, common bibimbap and gimbap. The flavor were new to us but very fresh and tasty, plus presentation was very good as you could see they put passion in their dishes. Service was also attentive and staff was helpful. I was also served fermented kimchi to taste but that was too extreme to me and i did not like it, but every othet dish was amazing. Totally recommend!",['bibimbap'],1

We chose this place after seeing other reviews on Tripadvisor and also since Korean food is not usually easily available in Europe. We were not disappointed! Since we don't eat meat we asked the waitress to make a vegetarian Bibimbap with eggs and veggies and use Tofu instead of Beef. She gladly took our order. Also our order came with some kind of 'soup' which was also nice and the Kimchi was just like I was expecting!

1283,Petrghe,비빔밥코리아 프라하,5.0,Temple of taste!❤️,"We spent last 18 months traveling around. We were always looking for Korean bistro to fulfill our desire for our favourite Bibimbap. This actually never happened, because the best and only real Bibimbap for us is the one that Mr. & Mrs. Lee are serving in their restaurant. There is no better Korean restaurant in English and Spanish speaking world! Their recipes for Kimchi and Tuna soup are just perfect. Soup is so strong and tasty, it is a cure for any weakness.

We went there yesterday after all those months. New place in Zizkov looks beautiful, servers are super friendly and happy as always and the food? The food was maybe even better then I remember!

My favourite combo is:

Bibimbap - in non-heated bowl (Mr. Lee's classic. It is not Korean traditional but the rice stays soft all the time and not ower dry from warmth of the bowl). Soup and kimchi comes with the meal. Total price of CZK150,- is cheap for what you get! And really good price point so everyone can afford this experience.

&

Tuna sushi - to share✌️ CZK130,- for 14pcs maxi roll!

Yummy!

I just love this place. Must-visit in Prague for sure!",['bibimbap'],1

What I love is that their bibimbap comes with such good and plentiful veggies that it's more or less a healthy dinner (in my possibly not especially objective opinion). The owner is super sweet and talkative and is clearly very proud of his little establishment.,['bibimbap'],1

Yellow tea - I took it without honey/sugar and it was not my favourite kind of tea. It tastes as burnt rice. It wasn't my favourite taste. But I drank it and felt good afterwards. It was a lovely experience to taste the spicy food with refreshing, rather sour salad.

The price was great for the food we got. Our budget was to stay under 200 CZK for one meal and one drink per person. And we did manage without problems.

The atmosphere was simple, it's not a place where I would go for interior design but food was my goal this time and it exceeded expectations. The serves was really friendly and explained all tastes and combinations. I really appreciated it. I will come back again.",['bibimbap'],1

For a plate of vegetable dumplings, fried squid that was thin and covered in panko and oily and a plain plate of beef short rib (£15!!!!!) bulgogi without rice or anything, we paid £33 - what the actual help?! The portions were tiny too. We were given tap water in a re-usable pink plastic water bottle you use to take water on your bicycle and then at the end of the meal, 2 slices of orange on a plate. By far the most bizarre and most expensive meal we have had which was not worth even £5 to make. We felt this was some kind of joke. Still can't quite believe it.

Each person ordered a few different dishes, the tables were full to the brim. I can honestly say that every single dish was incredible. The menu is full of choice, I’d recommend trying a few different things and sharing.

The only thing that let this experience down was the service, there was one waitress working and found it difficult to accommodate the 16 of us. Ordering took a really long time as she had trouble understanding what we wanted. The menu is numbered so we thought it would be simple enough but she said she didn’t know what each number was. Subsequently she then wrote down a few of our orders incorrectly.

1327,missjoke,Dain Korea,3.0,Hit and miss,"I've been eating here for a few years with no complaints but when we ate here recently they said they are no longer serving sushi. It's still on the menu which is a bit misleading. I usually have a beef bibibap which is delicious but decided to try something else and had some starters and seafood yaki soba. I agree with other reviews, the starters are a bit expensive and the yaki soba was bland and not very nice. My friend wasn't that impressed with his meal choice either. The service was a bit patchy which I can forgive if the food is good but sadly this wasn't the case this visit. I would still highly recommend the bibibap menu and please can you can start serving sushi again? Thank you!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
1328,pbfEngland,Dain Korea,4.0,Busy and good,"First time going to a Korean restaurant. We had very reasonable meals - agree that the starters are a bit expensive, but there is complimentary kim chee and also pickled radishes. There are also Japanese dishes on the menu, so there were things that all in our group could eat. There were a few things on the menu that weren't available on a Friday night, which was a bit unexpected (dessert, for one), but we were very happy to have eaten here and my daughter knew many of the Korean songs, so she was happy, too. Bibimbap - excellent, whether vegetarian, beef, chicken or raw beef. BYO, also.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

The restaurant is plain in decor and it doesn't need to make an effort as the food speaks for itself. It is BYO which makes it reasonably priced but not cheap. The food was spicy hot and flavoursome and we enjoyed all that we ordered.,"['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",0
1330,gooseontour,Dain Korea,4.0,"Great mains, expensive starters, BYO!","Been here several times because it is BYO which is great!
Recommend number 75 on the menu (can't remember what it is called) but it is spicy and comes absolutely boiling hot so takes a while to eat.
Also reccomend the Bibimbap if you don't like spice as much - you can add as much hot sauce as you like , then you mix up all of the dish and it is delicious!

Would say avoid the starters as they are very expensive (£5-7) and you don't get as much compared to the mains!

1331,freddylc,Dain Korea,5.0,Authentic and good value,"In contrast to the more westernised Korean/pan-Asian spots in Bristol, this place is a good shout if you’re looking for the real deal. It’s BYOB which is most definitely a plus in terms of value but implies a casual milieu. Would recommend for an impromptu dinner with friends. We were all very satisfied with our food (excellent kimchi) although I found the menu to be quite extensive and so it took some time for me to decide.

1332,Antonia W,Dain Korea,5.0,Incredible Korean meal!,"Visited Dain Korea as a family for an evening birthday meal. Was not disappointed!
It's tucked away and is definitely not what you expect from the exterior. The waitress was lovely and attentive, easily explained ingredients of particular dishes.
We visited as a group of four and over-ordered, the side dishes are very generous (almost a full meal in themselves) and we were given plenty of Banchan (Korean side dishes) to accompany our meal.
Food was delicious, 2/4 had seafood dishes that were perfect. No nasty after effects either!
Super spicy and warming dishes, main meals plenty.
It has a BYOB policy on larger quantities of alcohol but does serve 2 types of Asian beer, along with soft drinks.

This restaurant is just a small very unassuming basic establishment on Bristols bohemian Gloucester rd.
The decor is very street food style.
The staff very welcoming with a smile.
The menu is quite extensive and unless you have some guidance it is possible to select the wrong dish.
I has a sweet beef style dish accompanied with iceberg lettuce and a soya bean sauce .
My son had a dish with mixed veg and an egg on top and my wife had a chicken glass noodle one.

You even get the little kimchi and radish as a starter, which is brilliant also for those that never tried it so they can have a bit of a taste before ordering.
The BBQ is cooked in the kitchen instead of at the table but it tastes lovely so it's still worth it!
Would also advise the Tang Su Yuk for a starter if you're a fan of sweet and sour!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

Initially the decor does not look that promising but that is not really the point here. It is functional and clean. However the food is what makes this place a real find. We had a starter of prawn Mandu which are like gyoza. Lovely flavour with a beautifully crisp edge. For mains I had the beef Bibimbap which was beautifully flavoured. Essentially a rice dish but once all the ingredients are mixed in the bowl as is the custom the texture and flavours are luxurious and finely balanced.My wife had a noodle dish which was just as good.

There was key Korean and Japanese dishes, but not enough of either.

However, the Korean Pork dumplings were not shop bought and very tasty - always a good thing! The Bib-am-bab was very average - Not something I'd be rushing back to have!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

The food was really good and fresh. However, service was not that good. We asked for 6 wine glasses (BYOB by the way), and we had to ask them to change three of them as they were really dirty (one of them even had some salad on it!!!). Then, we ordered some starters to share which were all great and 6 main course. As 5 of us had our meals served after 45 minutes wait after we finished the starters (which were not cleared from the table), one of us didn't get his meal. We had to ask the waiter for the 6th meal, which they forgot about. I noticed during the dinner that other tables were not cleared until someone else was arriving... Overall, a descent restaurant with good prices but a poor customer service experience.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",0
1356,831HannahC,Dain Korea,2.0,Won't be going back - awful service,"Went here with two friends on a Tuesday night, we waited ages to order, and in the end just went up to the till. We then waited 40 minutes just for our drinks, and again we only got them because we went up and asked! We were never asked if we wanted anything else, and when it came time to pay, again we had to go up and ask after waiting for ages!!
There were other people in the same situation- I even saw one customer walk out after waiting without being served. It's a shame because the food is actually quite nice, I just don't think they understand the concept of customer service.

I lived in Korea between 2002-2004 and since returning to the UK, I had struggled to find a place that served proper Korean grub. Until now. Dain Korea's food is as good as anything I've eaten in the motherland.

The decor is a little basic, and it's not the place you'd go to for a posh night out but if you're after some top nosh then give this place a whirl.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
1359,Tooty88,Dain Korea,5.0,Friendly and fab food!,"My son recommended this restaurant but said it was very basic and that the food might not be for us.
He was wrong! This place provides Korean and Japanese food and is situated on busy Gloucester Road. It is unimposing from the outside but is clean and smart inside. Cooking is done by two very busy chefs in full view of diners. The waitress was Korean/Japanese herself and was only too willing to guide us through the extensive menu, most of which we couldn't understand.
I had a prawn tempura wrap to start with a bit of square of salmon and some wasabi which I was wary of from past experience- delicious - and for my main, a large bowl of rice, shredded veg, mushrioms, prawns etc., with a bowl of miso soup to mix in with it , all topped with an egg. Yum!
My husband had a chicken starter and a pork curry for his main which was too hot for him. The waitress was very concerned and said the chef would tailor any food to the required degree of hotness on a scale of 1-5.
We had green tea icecream to finish. You can bring your own wine but there is Japanese beer on offer which my husband said was very good, and a variety of teas and soft drinks.
This is an unpretentious, busy little place which provides super-fresh, tasty food at a reasonable price. The staff were lovely and for us it was nice to go somewhere a little different and guess what? - we are returning with visiting family in less than a week! By the way, my Malasian friend kniws this place well and recommends the Chilli Daddy takeaway ( they do those too).","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
1360,K_Leeds,Dain Korea,3.0,Slow and poor service,"Waitress service is poor, missing out drink and food orders: they definitely need more training or be valued well as part of the team. We had to physically approach them and chase up missing drink and food items as it was difficult to get their attention. If they bothered to ask if we had sufficient drinks or if the meal was satisfactory; they will soon have realised the missing orders.
Trying to pay took a minimum of 15 mins despite physically going up to pay to try speed up the process.
Note : We were not the only ones in the same situation as others repeatedly asked for their bills.
Staff were slow at cleaning up other people's table on a hot summer day which is not pleasant to look at.
Poor management of table arrangement and greeting of new guests: doesn't create the best atmosphere.
Observation : sitting new customers down but not giving them a menu... Until the guests asked for a menu. And taking another table's order who sat down after them, at which the guests did comment.
Food was 'ok', starters are better than the mains if I'm honest: there are better Korean restaurants in Bristol. Will not be returning or recommending to friends/family.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

Very tasty and authentic korean food, almost same as the food I tasted when I was in Korea. The staff is very friendly and would advise on the menu. But the most amazing thing about them is that they do delivery, although not everywhere but if you are in the centre or around you are good. Me and my friends order delivery all the time and it's so useful especially during exam period when everyone is too busy with revision. But you have to order food for more than £20.

I told the charming and friendly waitress that I did not know Korean cuisine and asked her to recommend - she pointed me at bibimap. It's served in a hot earthenware bowl with boiled rice in the bottom (making it crispy), layered with cooked vegetable, choice of chicken, beef, pork, prawn or tofu (beef recommended and taken), and an egg so the flavours go down into the rice - served with your own bottle of red chilli paste so you can control how hot you want it. I loved it and can't wait to go back. We washed it down with a (375ml) bottle of 18% rice wine, that went well and had a clean slightly vodka-like flavour. With a couple of side dishes and salads, we happily paid £20 each and left feeling full and satisfied. The same menu is served for lunch, mostly at reduced prices - a definite bargain!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
1365,tonydeltablues,Dain Korea,4.0,Good BYO Korean Restaurant,"We had a meal at Dain Korea for Mothers Day. We've been there before and I have gone for a cheap lunch on a few occasions.

Positives: It serves authentic Korean cuisine; the price is very reasonable (mains around £10.00); there is a great value (cash only) lunch menu; the Korean Set meals are good value if you are hungry.

Potential improvements: The interior is a little tired (previously, it was a short-lived burger joint) and it can lack a little 'ambiance' - that said, I quite like unpretentious cafes and restaurants.

On the day we visited, we had two children: they are from the lunch menu and my wife and I ate from the main Korean set meal. The kids liked their noodle dish (udon chicken noodles). Our menu consisted of lots of side dishes (as per Korean), kimchi, pickled vegetables, bulgogi (BBQ beef), kimchi pork and tofu stew, boiled rice.

We were full after that. Cost us around £58.00 with drinks total; we took our own wine.

Conclusions: If you want to try Korean food (a little different from your normal 'Asian' food) you should give it a go. Good place to go for lunch too. Perhaps not that a romantic setting for couples. Give it a go...","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

1373,Francesco C,Dain Korea,2.0,Definitely not impressed !,"On our last day in Bristol we popped into this restaurant for lunch although it looked pretty empty. The ambience was a bit on the dark side and it didn’t appear very clean with an open kitchen that looked like a corridor. Once we sat down we ordered Mandu which I guess is the Korean version of Gyoza. The flavour wasn’t too bad although I would have left it a bit more in the pan to get the pastry a bit crispier. The Seafood Pancake (which didn’t appear to have much seafood inside) with spring onion wasn’t too bad either although the middle was uncooked and had a gluey consistency. Then came the masterpiece! We orderered 2 katsu curry (Chicken and Pork) from the special lunch menu but we got was 2 cutlets in gloopy sauce that I believe is a different dish and it remainded me of branston pickle! I had the pork and the colour of the meat was almost black and had a funny taste. My fiancé’s chicken was a touch better but again it had a funny taste. We complained and they asked if we wanted something else and because we were famished we asked if we could have 2 portions of Mandu instead which were the best part of our meal but this time they arrived undercooked and one of them was cold in the middle. I don’t have a problem if they were frozen before but at least they could have been cooked properly. It is not that they were too busy either, there was us and another table, so why the rush? We complained again and the waitress then later on the owner pretended that there was a misunderstanding regarding the curry. Well, that wasn’t our problem as we had ordered from the daily special menu and there was only one curry option! Anyway the owner wanted us not to pay the bill but we insisted that we wanted too and at end we paid for the 2 dishes we ate. This has to be one of the most unpleasant meals for sometime!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",0

1375,Amber T,Dain Korea,4.0,Unpretentious food,"Having wanted to visit Dain for a while, we were finally in the area when the restaurant is opened.

There is nothing pretentious about this restaurant, no gimmicks, just decent Korean food, which to us is a plus. We could feel that the chef put his heart into the food he prepared. Thank you!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
1376,tomv86,Dain Korea,4.0,Favourite Bristol restaurant,"Have been to Dain Korea three times now and have never been disappointed.

The service is always quick and friendly, the menu is quite expansive and the food is extremely cheap given its quality. BYOB keeps the bill right down, and means that this is a good place to dine with friends or in reasonably large groups.

Some might find the atmosphere a little strange - it's a small place, packed with seating, and the decor manages to be both sparse and eclectic (black and white prints of Amsterdam canals anyone?). For me this is a big plus - it's unpretentious and friendly and is a good sign that they are rightly concentrating on the quality of the food over style. Makes for a relaxed and welcoming meal.

The food is always fantastic - can't get enough of the kim chee, and the dolsot bibimbap is excellent. At this price you might expect rice dishes and the like to be stodgy and nondescript, but the spices and flavours are vibrant and crisp. There's an array of dishes and a lot of reasonably priced starters and sides so you can dip in and out of several different foods.

Menu is a bit light on vegetarian food which is why I can't give 5 stars - but that's more down to Korean cuisine I suspect than the restaurant itself. There's also quite a lot of tofu and vegetable dishes to keep you busy.

I always leave feeling happy and satisfied (as well as a little drunk). Long live Dain Korea!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

1381,Carmen E,Dain Korea,5.0,YUM! - Great authentic food....one of our favourites!,"We found Dain Korea by accident – but it is now one of our favourites have been 5+ times!

The food is pretty amazing, great quality, fresh, tasty and plenty of it – plus the added extras like the miso soup are fab! For us, I think one of the biggest reasons we go back and have recommended Dain Korea to our friends and family is because it’s very good quality. The staff in particular are incredible friendly make us feel really welcome.

The sushi is pretty good too and smashes places like Yo Sushi out of the park.

The only thing I would say is that because it’s made to order, there can be a wait when it’s busy….but what would you rather? Microwaved precooked fast food or beautiful fresh dishes? It’s a no brainer.

It’s also BYO – for £2 a head bargain!
LOVE IT….can’t wait to return.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

1385,Hyunho K,Dain Korea,5.0,"Fresh ingredients, authentic and great prices","As a Korean I can vouch for the dishes' authenticity. Really tasty food with fresh ingredients.
Apart from the prices, my favourite thing about the place was probably that they don't use MSG which can be commonly used in cheap oriental restaurants.
Friendly service too. The place is cheap and cheerful, don't expect luxurious decor.
If you are new to Korean, go for the classic bibimbap dish.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
1386,geriatrix,Dain Korea,4.0,Excellent budget lunch,"Had a good lunch here, great value. They have both pork and chicken Korean curry dishes on the menu. I had the chicken, which was great, but I would have said that the sauce was nearer to sweet and sour than curry. I enjoyed it though. My wife had the pork, and that came with a completely different sauce, nearer to the sort of ""curry sauce"" you get from a Chinese takeaway. Anyway, she enjoyed it too! Although its a BYO, they do sell Korean beer.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

1388,Sc_ottar,Dain Korea,4.0,"Still good, but standards are slipping slightly","We visited Dain Korea when it first opened and it was instantly one of my favourite restaurants. It offered great authentic Korean food and a great price. I was however a little disappointed about my last trip there. It seems like standards are starting to slip. The portions are getting smaller and the quality is starting to go down a little (mince beef in the Bibimbap rather than steak). I also feel that the prices have raised slightly. That said, this is still by far the best Korean restaurant in town (far, far better than Surakahn) and I will be returning soon, just maybe not quite as soon as I would have done based on my first impressions!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

1396,Jackie W,Dain Korea,4.0,Everyone should know about this place!,"I've been searching an authentic Korean restaurant in Bristol for ages - and this place has finally satisfied those cravings. Don't let its unpretentious decor fool you; despite being only a few months old, Dain Korea shows good variety in its menu and the dishes taste authentic. None of those letdown flavours adapted to cater to coddled, less adventurous palates. We're talking about the real deal here.

The staff are polite and attentive, and we were promptly served complimentary banchan of braised soy sauce eggs and spicy pickled shredded cabbage while we waited for our order. I ordered tteokbokki and pajeon, both of which were delicious. My companion, who was a Korean cuisine virgin prior to this visit, was happy with his bibimbap as well. Only been here twice - definitely looking forward to dining here again soon.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
1397,18time,Dain Korea,5.0,Outstanding authentic Korean food at a good price,"I have been searching for a decent, reasonably priced Korea restaurant for years. I spent a year living in South Korea and generally I find that Korean restaurants in the UK are overpriced and the food is unauthentic. This is certainly not the case with Dain Korea. Typically under decorated which is pretty reminiscent of real Korean restaurants, the food is the main attraction. I'm so happy we went here and we will be coming back again and again. The staff are great and the lovely waitress who told me she was from Daegu was really friendly. I hope to go back once they are selling alcohol because the only thing that would make this better was if they also sold Makgeolli. As far as the food goes it was all exceptional. The bulgogi is as amazing as it should be and the bibimbap was delicious. The tang su yuk was a real treat as since leaving Korea I haven't been able to find this anywhere else; I'd recommend anyone who hasn't tried this to do so! Even if you've never tried Korean food before, you need to give this a go. You won't regret it. 10/10. 감사합니다","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

The service is outstanding and the food is delicious and bountiful. I got the Bulgogi entree and my Mom got Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop. We didn’t know that we also got all of these yummy side dishes too. The daughter of the owner came over to check on us. It was an excellent experience. I wondered if their food would taste like the Bulgogi I had in the 80’s back in Korea and it was!

1434,G9681FDfrancisb,Lime Orange,3.0,Good and Bad,"The King Prawn starter was delicious the Katsu chicken not so much. The vegetable dumplings were not good, the veggie in our group took a bite and suspected that it contained meat only after 3x going backwards and forwards were we able to determine that they contained quorn. This was very poorly handled and none of the servers seemed to know what the dumplings contained.
.
My main was half cold, 1/4 warm and 1/4 hot ... I was told that the hot bowl would warm my food but my friend had the same and her rice was too hot to eat so this cannot be the case. I chose to leave my food.
We also ordered spicy chicken wings which tasted nice but the waiters walked past our table multiple times and we were only given napkins after about 15 minutes.

They seemed to avoid the table seemingly not wanting to deal with the situation and probably not wanting us to ask for it to be removed from the bill. The bill came to £72 for the 4 of us we paid £20 each but would have been justified in not leaving a tip and requesting for the ""veg"" starter and main meal be removed. It's a shame that they didn't offer a better level of customer service, I can't in good faith reccommend them to others.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

1443,Iain H,Lime Orange,5.0,Superb Korean Restaurant,"Lime Orange was a superb find. We had possibly one of the best Korean meals I have tasted outside of South Korea.

Lime Ornage does not take reservations and it is clear why. The restaurant is packed from opening until closing with queues out into the street throughout the evening. Tables are jam-packed into this tiny restaurant with hardly any space between them to squeeze into. But nobody minds being a little close to the next table of diners in an ultra-busy restaurant where the service never falters and the food is exquisite.

Lime Orange is situated directly opposite the Apollo Victoria, where Wicked has been playing for the past several years; it is a block from Victoria railway station, two blocks from HM Passport Office and three blocks from Buckingham Palace, so there is no end of potential passing trade.

Lime Orange is a family owned and run business and so service and food quality are given the highest priorities. No matter how busy the staff were, they remained attentive and friendly.

We will definitely return in the future.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1447,mcfc1964,Lime Orange,4.0,First taste of Korean food.,"Visited pre theatre and weren’t disappointed. We both went for the set meal number 2 which was gorgeous. Plenty of food, good value and friendly staff. One slight criticism, it felt like we were being rushed as the main meal was served before we’d finished our starter. Well worth a visit though.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1448,nmgayton,Lime Orange,4.0,Good meal - tight space,"Chose this restaurant as it was within walking distance to our hotel and based on TripAdvisor recommendations. This is a small floorplan with very limited seating and we had to wait on the sidewalk (fortunately less than ten minutes) before being seated as there is not a waiting area- reservations are strongly recommended. My spouse had the beef bulgogi and I had the bullgogi hot pot. Rice and sides were all extra and not included. Food was good, and the hotpot was excellent for the cold, damp evening.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1451,mis-jay,Lime Orange,4.0,"Not bad, would return a 2nd time","I made a reservation for 2 people by calling the day earlier. I turned up the next day on time but the whole restaurant was packed and not a single table was empty. I informed them of my reservation and the 2 staff didn't seem to be aware of the reservation. So I was made to wait for 5-6 mins while they cleared up a table for me.

We ordered the following to about £45:
- Veg mandu - not tasty, just average but the apple cide vinegar dip was nice
- Spicy Calamari - the best dish of everything we had. the sauce is sweet & spicy.
- Pa jeon - seafood pancake was tasty as well
- Kimchi fried rice - shouldn't have ordered this as it was bland and the kimchi wasn't as spicy or tasty. Served with a lovely Miso soup however!
- Chicken spicy noodles - had a spicy taste and the chicken tasted good.

very generous portions of the rice and noodles. We were sated at the end. The mains were disappointing but the starters were good. Would prolly order their popular Bibimbap next time.

The staff were friendly and the service was quick considering the crowded place. however I felt that 2 people are not enough to run the service and reception. Definitely need another pair of hands on a busy afternoon.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

We ordered a starter and main course each and were more than satisfied with the portion sizes.
The spicy calamari and Pa Jeon pancake starters were very good and no sooner had we finished than the main courses arrived. my wife loved the chicken bimimbap and for me, the beef bulgogi (with lettuce and rice) was truly delicious! we had a kimchee cucumber and pear salad with the mains and that was outstanding! Fresh and delicious. It's a shame the Korean beer was tasteless, but everything else was great and the young staff were really helpful and friendly.

Never eaten Korean before. Didn't really know what to order. Everyone around us had mountains of food that looked amazing.
Went for a few starters and beef bullogi (?) for main. SO TASTY!!!!
Unfortunately nothing we ordered looked like what the other diners were eating but nevertheless what we got was great. We asked the waitress for a few dishes pointing out some other tables but due to the language barrier she didn't really understand what we meant.
Chopsticks and a spoon (for the soup I guess) no other cutlery. We used the chopsticks for about 5 mins then gave up and went for the spoon feeling a little silly as everyone else using them with ease.
Tables a little sticky.
Reasonably priced food.

We looked inside from the window, it looked packed with a party of three already waiting. We were immediately welcome by a waiter, who told us “5 minutes” and shorter than that a table became free and we had our place. The dishes came surprisingly fast, and were simply delicious and authentic (we have extensive travel experience to Korea). We loved the Katsu, the Bibimbab, the Bulgogis. They even import a Korean beer. Despite the hectic of a Saturday night, the staff was all calm, efficient and very personal and friendly. The prices are reasonable.

It's close to both the Apollo & Palace theatres, but I strongly suggest booking ahead if you want to go pre-theatre - not on the day, as they don't take same day bookings.

We were not sure what to order so in the end went for some starters and one main course which was plenty between the 4 of us. The tempura prawns were amazing and the calamari in the sticky sweet and sour sauce was amazing

Once of my own volition and again on the recommendation of a friend - I wasn't complaining. The first time I had the tofu salad and jeon, both OK for vegans, although a couple more members of staff could do with knowing what is and isn't vegan on their menu. These choices were decent if a little greasy. The second time when I went back I had the tofu bibimbap and that was pretty impressive. The restaurant is very close to Victoria station and not all that expensive. It was packed both nights and I would go again.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1465,Sarah P,Lime Orange,4.0,Great food at a really good price considering the location,A colleague recommended this place as I was meeting a friend straight from work and it was close by. Given that we went on a Monday evening and were starving at 6.30 we figured it would be pretty quiet there but the place was heaving - always a good sign. We had one of the set menus and I have to say it was all delicious. The staff were all friendly and realised that we hadn't had Korean food before so explained how we were supposed to assemble one of the dishes (we'd have worked it out but was nice to be helped) My only slight negative point was that the tea was very weak; I had the Korean tea which had some flavour but my friend had the green tea and said that it tasted of nothing but hot water. I will definitely be back,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1466,EmilyA_12,Lime Orange,5.0,Family pre theatre dinner,"What to say other than this place exceeds expectations. I'm very difficult to please when it comes to eating out and really struggled to choose from the menu as everything sounded good. The staff were brilliant, giving us time and answering many questions. I was recommended the kimchi soup which comes with rice. Others had the noodles or bibimbap. When they arrived, portions were huge but with lots of flavour. The bibimbaps were incredible but I think the kimchi soup won hands down. Hot, spicy and full of ingredients I can't wait to come back to have it again. Can't stress enough how great this place is!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1470,Charlotte T,Lime Orange,5.0,Very tasty first experience of Korean food,"We were running very late for grabbing a pre-theatre meal..saw this restaurant directly opposite Apollo Victoria theatre was busy so assumed it must be good food.

1471,LawranceTraveller,Lime Orange,5.0,Fantastic intro to Korean food,"We needed to find food quite quickly in the Victoria area. A look on TA and we decided on this place. No regrets!

Ambience: busy, tight-packed, bustling eatery. First thing we noticed - lots of Koreans. Always a good sign when people recognise their own cuisine!

Service: despite pressure, friendly and attentive. Very good.

Food: outstanding. We had Seafood bibimbap (for me) and Chicken katsu with udon noodles (for her). But we shared each other’s. Both very good - the bibimbap possible the more interesting and, in its massive stone bowl, stayed piping hot for ever.

Drink: a had Hite beer - fine with the food.

Value: good, we felt, given location. £31.68, Inc pre-included service charge. The tip would have been bigger if it hadn’t been included!

Verdict: I want to go back!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1476,RebeccaJayne93,Lime Orange,4.0,Great food,"Everything pictured below cost around £33- including drinks. The picing is incredibly good. The only downside was that we were a party of two, who wanted to order the bbq, but could only do so if we ordered 3 persons worth of food. My friend and I wanted to try a variety of foods so opted for a shared selection.

The ttoboki was incredibly tasty, but as avid spicy food/ hotpot eaters it was not spicy enough. When I return I plan to ask for it to be spicier.

The staff were incredibly nice- specially the young man who served us. We order just before the place became busy, and eventhough the place was packed, he was still incredibly polite and full of smiles. As we sat down he offered to put our suitcases and bags outback. We didn't catch his name, but we arrived at the place on the 03/ 06 and would really like to praise him for his servicing.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1481,LauraC4712,Lime Orange,4.0,Popular for a reason,"Perfectly located for the Apollo theatre (Wicked), this is a great place for a pre-show meal. They open at 5 and when we arrived at about 5 past there were already 2 tables seated. By half past the restaurant was full and people were waiting. We were asked if we had a reservation (which we didn't) and I would certainly recommend booking if planning to arrive any later than we did. The food was well explained on the menu and the friendly staff were on hand to help make recommendations. Service was extremely quick (in fact we were in and out in just over an hour) and the food is all brought out as soon as it is ready without a clear gap between courses. This might bother some people but I didn't feel like we were being rushed. The food itself was beautifully presented and of good quality. Having not tried Korean food before I found the flavours a little disappointing (slightly bland) compared to some other Asian cuisines, but I think that's more personal taste. Overall I would definitely recommend the place for a value for money pre-show meal if you like Asian food.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

Not a place I'd take young children in buggies as space is tight though.

As a vegetarian the choice was limited so I had the Tofu Udon and the ladies had Chicken Katsu Udon. The noodles were barely warm and generally the meal was bland and uninteresting.

I cannot recommend this delightful family run restaurant highly enough.

I understand why Lime Orange don't take bookings between 18:00-19:30, so my tip is to get there early (17:30 latest) if you want to get a table and enjoy this delicious food without being too rushed. A queue developed at times, but was quite fast moving.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

The restaurant is quite small and is always busy so booking is recommended for parties of 4+ at peak times. Despite being always busy, they take the orders and serve the food fairly quickly.
Our favourite dish is the bibimbap, a Korean rice dish served in a bowl that it is so hot that anything that touches it sizzles for minutes. They have different options and I have personally tried this with tofu, kimchee and seafood, but they also have meaty options like chicken and beef.

1506,BarristerLondon,Lime Orange,4.0,Surprised to find this here - very good,"In the tourist trap zone adjacent to Victoria station, remarkable to find this genuinely good, reasonably priced authentic Korean restaurant - packed with Koreans to underline that.

Seafood Korean pancake - very good & an excellent chicken bimimbap. Nice squid & a good seafood bibimbap as well. Water - £40 in total.

Very nice service. I seriously rated it.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1509,Adzs93,Lime Orange,3.0,"Nice, but not particularly memorable","Came here for a post-theatre meal. The starters of Chicken Katsu and Spicy Calamari were both great ways to kick things off with flavourful and large portions, but the mains were a bit of a let down in comparison. I had the Beef Bibimbap and my friend had the Seafood Bibimbap. Whilst both were pleasant, and interesting for a pair of Korean food novices, neither dish was particularly memorable or packed a real punch. On the flip side the service was attentive and informative throughout. I'd definitely come back again, if only to try something different, as again all in all our meal was decent.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1510,PlamenB27,Lime Orange,3.0,The food I found to be nice but overpriced. The service - very average,"I've been to this restaurant about five times over the last year or so and I can confidently say the the following three things have been consistent every time
- The food was nice enough
- The price was more than I'd expect
- The service was rushed and bordering unpleasant

I can explain a little more.

On points 1 & 2 - the food is OK, authentic - can't say, nice enough- yes. But overpriced. Within a few minutes walk of this place you can have the same quality Korean food at a much reasonable price.

On point 3 -
The space is very limited and that's fine but to be asked to wait until ""the rest of your party arrives"" before you are given a table ""because they don't want to lose a seat"" is not something I want to do. To me that tells me I am valued less than the restaurant selling a table/seat. I accept that this could be perfectly fine for many but is not for me.

Overall average is the best I can give this place and I'm aiming not to visit again.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

Mine had lovely tasty fluffy rice with 7 or 8 different types of steamed vegetable, pork that had been marinated in a delicious sesame-y marinade, and a little bowl of miso soup on the side, while my wife's dinner consisted of a beautiful fragrant soup with delicious marinated beef in it, with a bowl of that lovely rice on the side. I was also delighted to see they serve Makgeolli, that lovely Korean light rice wine. The place was absolutely heaving, with a queue of people out the door, many or whom were Koreans, though we only had to wait 10 mins or so to be seated. The service was quick and friendly, and we left 40 mins later with smiles on our faces.

Korean food can be light, even vegetarian, spicy or not depending on your preference, and the kimchee won't upset the people sitting next to you in the theatre. I had udon noodles, supposedly spicy; they weren't piquant but they were fresh and umami. My friend had bibimbap with tofu. Both dishes were generous and filling. We shared kimchee pancakes, like potato pancakes but crunchier. Service was unobtrusive and efficient. Arrive early for pre-theatre because it gets crowded the closer you get to show time.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We love the cucumber kimchee and beef bimbibap but the chicken and ramen was too spicy for us. However some people might like the 'spicyness' so this is relative. The atmosphere is typical asian cafe place but it did feel a bit cramp but I think that is because the restaurant was trying to pack as many seats as possible to maximum sales which is understandable. The service was good and the staff was friendly. Also, this place only take cash so bear that in mind. In summary, this is definitely an option for a pre-theatre meal and I would go back again if I am around the neighbourhood and if I crave for Asian food.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

Service very friendly too.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1535,Kelly V,Lime Orange,4.0,Decent Korean grub round the corner from Victoria,"The restaurant is conveniently located less than 5 minutes walking from Victoria train/coach/underground station, so it's a busy area but the restaurant itself is away from most of the footfall. While we were there however, at around 7pm midweek, the restaurant was consistently busy with a constant stream of diners.

It's pretty small and quite cramped, and it was slightly uncomfortable having the waiting diners practically hanging over our table, so ideally they should carve out a space for waiting (but then they'd lose a table and welcome income, I imagine)

That said, the food was great! Not quite up there with Kimchi in Holborn but far cheaper, good portion sizes & a really good selection on the menu. Was pleased to see a tofu bibimbap for veggies.

The kimchi wasn't quite spicy enough for our liking and the mandu (dumplings) were only lukewarm but these are mild complaints and all was worth it for the delicious bibimbaps which we spent an hour over, scraping the burnt rice from the bottom of the stone bowl (don't judge, it's the best part)

The service was also very friendly, all the servers were smiley and helpful, if a little rushed. Overall, I would recommend a visit to Lime Orange with friends for something quite quick (or even alone at the window bench), but probably not for a romantic meal, or for somewhere to relax with drinks for a while.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1539,ridwanb2015,Lime Orange,4.0,Friendly service and tasty Yangyeum Chicken!,"Came here for a casual meal with a friend (who's quite a foodie) based on reviews and the apparent halal options available (there is a sign in the window saying the chicken is halal, and the member of the waiting staff that I asked said the same).

We hadn't booked and managed to get a table, but it turns out we definitely should have if we were planning on coming a bit later (we got there a little before 18:30 I think)! The restaurant got packed pretty quickly but not in chaotic manner, and the service we received was very friendly and helpful throughout.

As I said in the title, the Yangyeum chicken (which we shared for starters) was very tasty and the batter was crispy. For mains I went for the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi, with lettuce and rice, and my friend went for the Beef Bibimbap (which comes with rice). I enjoyed my dish, even if I struggled a little at first with how to eat it (the waiter did very politely give me advice when they served it), and my friend described their course as okay (I'd say I'm less fussy than them :P, but if they say it's ""okay"", it's ""good"" for me, and if they say it's ""amazing"", it's ""really good"" for me).

Tables were generally clean though one or two spots seemed a little sticky, and the toilets (well, I can only comment on the men's) seemed to be kept in good condition. Food was served fairly promptly and, despite how busy it was getting with people waiting to be seated, we were never made to feel rushed or anything like that. It's not that expensive, but I think if it were a little cheaper, I'd be likely to come back here for a quick bite if I were in the area.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We had a show to see across the street at Apollo Victoria, and were, unfortunately, a little short on time. Service was quick and friendly, and the food came out fresh, hot, and absolutely delicious.

I haven't had Korean food very often, but Lime Orange is the best I've had. The spicy calamari we tried as a starter had a couple of pieces that were a little chewy, but most were just about perfect. I really liked their kimchi, too. I had chicken katsu udon, and the chicken was crisp, moist, and the sauce was very good. The noodles and vegetables perfectly cooked, in my opinion.

My husband had the pork belly bulgogi with fresh lettuce leaves, and he loved it.

The portion sizes seemed very generous to us, and we both had to leave some on our plates, leaving full and satisfied with our dinner.

It is a small place, maybe a bit cramped if you're a bit of a larger build, and they were completely full our entire visit. I imagine they often are.

1566,Wildsnoopster,Lime Orange,3.0,Take Away Review,"Ordered a take away to collect and have to say the prawns and squid starter were excellent. Great enough to make you want to return to then restaurant. The Kim GUI was just ok for me, the chilli chicken and the chicken Katsu udon didn't travel well. The chilli chicken lacked some umph and the katsu just needed some more sauce or jus or something to help it along. I think this would be much better in the restaurant.

The starters were truly tasty and I think the katsu will be better so although only a 3/5 I would go to the restaurant to try it out","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We look forward to our next visit.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1569,Digbyziggy,Lime Orange,5.0,A hidden gem!,"I’ll be honest, we weren’t supposed to be going to Lime Orange - our first choice was closed! But my colleague loves Korean food and suggested Lime Orange. And what a great second choice!!

From the outside, Lime Orange doesn’t look much. But at 615 on a Monday evening it was almost full and tables filled as soon as they became free. People obviously knew something we didn’t!

Service was prompt and friendly. And the food was excellent. This was my first Korean meal so my colleague ordered two different Bulgogi and some side dishes. And I was instantly hooked! Fresh, tasty, well-prepared and super tasty.

And very reasonable at £25 for more than enough food washed down with a Korean Hite beer each.

Such an unexpected gem amidst the tourist rip-offs in the area!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The beef soup is filling and really hearthy. 4.50£ (takeaway) for a portion and it is quite cheap and healthy as well. My korean workmate loves their soup. That tells alot about it. I will definitely return. They accept only cash for order below 7£ and it can get quite packed during lunch time.

The quantity of the food was enough so it was difficult to finish all.

1579,chinesesun,Lime Orange,4.0,Very Good Korean Standards,"This restaurant was near perfect for a casual bus inn luncheon. Standards such as kimchi, bulgolgi and grilled meats at the table were served in good portions and were satisfying. The restaurant was a bit noisy, not not distracting. The noise added a layer of confidentiality to the business discussion.

The restaurant has room for improvement. The added chili was a limp bottled sauce. There were no small dishes, typical of more upscale places. And the seafood in the bulgogi was small in size and a tad light in volume within the dish. Though the cuisine was geared for a British audience, there were several Koreans among the clientele.

Prices were reasonable and service was good.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We were seated as it opened at 5 as were several other tables; the service was efficient but not rushed - they are clearly used to the pre-theatre crowd. But oh my goodness, the food! It was delicious! A Korean food fan in our group ordered a variety of dishes for us and she was seriously impressed, I just kept eating. The food was fresh and plentiful and superb. So concentrated were we on our dinner, that we’d not noticed the restaurant was packed and folk were waiting.

Forget the theatre, go for great food.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We arrived at 530pm and there is not very busy. The decoration is cozy. But the table is a bit close to next table. The food served very quick. The waiter came to explain how we should enjoy the food. He is very friendly and we spend some time to talk to him about Korean culture as well. The food taste so good that make me feel like I am in Korean. We finished our dinner within a hour and people was waiting for the seat. Therefore we left and heading to our show.,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1586,Deborah B,Lime Orange,1.0,A non starter!,Meeting a friend for lunch we thought we would try Lime Orange. When we arrived it was really busy but there was a table for 4 available so we sat ourselves down and waited to be served. After five minutes we were told that as there was only 2 of us we had to move and join the table behind us. We did ask if we could stay on our table and other people join us but they wanted to keep the table for 4 free just in case a party of 4 walked in. So we joined the other table (although the current occupants were a little taken aback) but there really was not much room for 4 and couldn’t talk freely. Then table for 2 became available so we moved to the free table. We were then told we couldn’t have this table as it had been reserved! So no one waiting. A table for 4 and a table for 2 unused but we could only join a table already occupied by 2 people. At the point we felt very unwelcome and decided to leave. My view on the food can’t be included but we definitively did not feel the love! Looking at other posts it seems we aren’t the only ones dissatisfied with their seating technique. If you want Korean food then give it a try but if there are just 2 or less in your party then find somewhere a bit more welcoming.,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

I found the service to be brisk and efficient, food great - i had the seafood bibimbap (lots of seafood - delicious) and my friend chose the pork belly with rice and lettice (which he enjoyed too).

The restaurant has a row of tables - galley style - quite close together - but we did not find this uncomfortable and were able to converse well.

Beers were bottled (korean and japanese offered) and served cold.

We had an enjoyable couple of hours at this restaurant - and although the menu may be somewhat limited ( compared to a previous visit I had to a Korean restuarant) the food smacks of Korean flavours.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1595,happypanda17,Lime Orange,5.0,Perfect Korean food located near the theatre,"We went to Lime Orange before seeing Hamilton - the distance between the theatre and restaurant is minimal. If using Google maps you are sent to the back of the building so maybe ask a nearby shop for directions if you are not sure. The restaurant decor is basic but comfortable. There is a takeaway menu available.

Food was great, affordable and came out promptly. Our server was friendly and efficient. The bibimbap was amazing and reminded me of my travels in Korea. The kimchi is homemade and pairs well with the dishes. The main dishes are a good portion size and will keep you full. The barley tea is a really lovely way to finish the meal and tastes like coffee. The only element of the meal I was disappointed in was the black sesame ice cream: the concept is a good idea however the ice cream had ice crystals.

Overall this is a good restaurant for those who love no frills, yummy Korean food.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We ordered a bottle of soju between us, jug of water, Japchae, Kimchee Jeon, Cucumber Kimchee and the Spicy chicken bulgogi with rice and lettuce. All dishes were super tasty and all worked well together along with all the dipping sauces on the table. Needless to say my friend lived the food and was impressed by how good it was compared to other places she's tried.
The only improvement would be to have other flavours of Soju! We'll definitely be back, and most likely booking a table as well!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We reconfirmed our reservation two days before as we were travelling 60 miles into London to meet friends for supper. We arrived on time to be informed yes they had our reservation but they had no tables available. We would have to wait standing for maybe twenty minutes and then he could squeeze five of us onto a table for four. Said he was sorry and they just overbooked tables. This was said matter of factly -it would appear to be their normal practice. No free drink offered if we chose to wait. We left and found a good restaurant nearby. The front of house staff couldn’t have cared less. With such an indifferent cavalier attitude to customers you have to wonder what happens in their kitchen.

We had kimchi pancake, spicy chicken, dolsot bibimbab, chicken katu with udon noodle, hot pot bulgogi. The flavour was there but all of were over sweetened.

1622,Ruth K,Lime Orange,2.0,Poor understanding of food allergies - allergic customers beware!,"This restaurant doesn't seem to understand the seriousness of food allergies. I have a very serious - potentially life-threatening - nut allergy so when we arrived I specifically told the waiter that I had a nut allergy when we ordered our mains, and asked him to go and check that the food didn't have nuts in.

After we'd eaten our main meal (which was delicious - best bibimbap in London!), I asked a waitress for the dessert menu. She said there was just green tea icecream for dessert, so we ordered some. When it came, I tried some and I thought it had nuts in - which the staff confirmed - although they hadn't felt it necessary to mention when I ordered! I thought this was really poor, particularly as I'd explicitly let them know about my allergy.

Fortunately, I only ate a tiny quantity of the ice-cream, so I didn't have a serious anaphylactic allergic reaction, just stomach cramps and some difficulty breathing. But someone with a more serious allergy than mine could easily have died from that - so Lime Orange needs to do a lot better to support its customers with allergies.

I really wouldn't recommend eating here if you have serious food allergies!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

We went for the £18.50 set menu, the vegetable dumplings to start with were little parcels or tastiness, our main was Chicken Bulgogi served with rice and side of lettuce leafs. The guy explained we had to use the lettuce leaf like a wrap and add the chicken etc, this was a great experience, the tastes were gorgeous.

I had been wanting to come to this place for a while but surely won't be coming back due to the appalling service.

We both had the Bibimbap after asking for recommendations from the waiter, which he carefully explained along with some other items on the menu that we had never heard of. Once the food arrived we were instructed what it was and how you are supposed to eat it. Overall the food was both tasty and inexpensive and the service was very good.

1637,Andrew A,Lime Orange,5.0,Miss ing home food,"Saw Lime Orange on TI with great reviews; once again I must agree with my fellow TI reviewers! Having lived in Korea of and on for 12 years this is a good Korean restaurant. They would do well in Korea. They do not serve all the side dishes like you would find in the Kunsan region, but that aside it is good Korean food. We had the Bi-Bin with beef and one with seafood.
The place is smallish by England standards, maybe seating 50 to 60 people. We walked in and there were two tables open for two people each. From 1900 to 2000 (Thursday) we saw they had to turn away a dozen people; very popular!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We ordered a few dishes and the food was perfectly fine. I just didn't feel any of the food was really great given the other reviews. I ordered the Kimchi-jjigae but found it to be a little too watery (more like a soup than a stew). Staff were attentive and overall it was a fair experience. I would also say the place is quite small, and the seating on the wall was a little uncomfortable. Two starters, a side dish and three mains with drinks for three people came to around £60","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

1640,I1428ZBbrianm,Lime Orange,5.0,Excellent pre-theatre dinner venue,"My wife and I had tickets to see Wicked, as part of our first wedding anniversary, and wanted somewhere local to the theatre to enjoy a pre-show dinner. I took a chance on google to suggest venues and Lime Orange came up as one of the top recommendations so off we went.

It was exactly the right choice. The service was quick and very efficient, despite it being very busy, almost full. The food was absolutely superb. I chose the spicy chilli prawns for a starter, my wife the Tofu salad. The prawns were huge and incredibly well done, the sauce perfect. My wife's salad was exactly the same, simple but excellent. For mains I had the Katsu chicken curry, my wife the Tofu Bibimbap. Again, both were simply perfect.

However, beyond the food, there was one thing that makes us give this restaurant the 5* it deserves. We arrived with enough time to eat before curtain up. However each set of diners who arrived after us were asked if they were going to the theatre. As time closed on curtain up each new customer was advised of how long each sitting might take and that they may not make curtain up.

This restaurant was willing to lose covers to allow them to get to the show on time. That's a very unselfish and utterly professional decision that favours the customer.

My wife and I will go back for the food alone and will definitely recommend it to anyone wanting sensibly priced, beautifully cooked food, excellent service and an eye for customer service second to none.

Go visit....","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

I had the Chicken Katsu Udon, which is a delicious fried chicken with a sweet sauce and some very tasty noodles with vegetables, and the Soy Chicken which was great as well.
All waiters are very nice, although very busy as the place is packed.
I highly recommend this place. Just be patient if there's a line (try to come around 8.30 or 9 as the place is less busy) and enjoy the food!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1643,363suzy,Lime Orange,2.0,Great staff and average food.,"We visited for dinner and felt welcome and staff were so friendly. We were served food very quickly, within 10 minutes or so after ordering dishes.

We ordered Bibimbap, beef BBQ, rice, Kimchee, but beef was thick and dried, seems not marinated enough and so it was different from what I expected.
When we got a bill, we found that they added service fee and I was surprised as casual restaurant like this normally do not add.

It was disappointing that food quality, staff service, restaurant concept seem not matching even though staff service was wonderful.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1646,Daniel B,Lime Orange,1.0,Didn't even sit down,"I've never felt so unwelcome at any restaurant in my life. In 5 minutes it became apparent the money grabbing philosophy in which they work, so I didn't even get to sit down.

First of, when I arrived a party of 4 arrived behind me. The waiter didn't even look at me and got them a table first. I attempted to speak out but neither waiter or customers were bothered.

But the worse part came next, when I finally got some attention, I asked for a table for 1. The waiter said at the moment they only had the counter which is just next to the door. As this was the windiest and rainiest day of the last month, I said I'd prefer not to. I wanted a small table. This was flat out refused. When I asked why I couldn't get a table, the waiter said if a party of 2 comes then they always have priority. Mind you, no one was waiting behind me at this point and I still got told I could only get my table an hour later when for them it was unlikely to be able to fill it up with 2 people.

Such short-sighted vision to customer service can only be from team orders and not a one-time experience. This made me leave straight away with the promise of never returning.

I'm in restaurants all the time because of work and this is the first time anything remotely similar happened to me. Bad service might not translate directly to bad food in the short run but it will eventually catch up and they will lose their customers. Unacceptable.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

First the place is very crowded which by itself is not bad ( may indicate good food) , but after waiting a while the get seated, we found out that the Korean bear was not cold and there were couple of other options that we didn't look or. The appetizers were really small and the kimchi was not very pickled but rather mushy and not to much flavor. Also the barbecue was not crisp and not very well marinated. And to top everything we almost got embarrassed at the end when we were told that their card reader wasn't working and that we should go across the street to get some cash.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0
1650,IzzMc_2016,Lime Orange,5.0,Hidden Gem,"We almost walked straight past Lime Orange, and honestly from the outside it doesn't do much to entice you in. However we had heard good things about the place and decided to give it a go, and we are so glad we did. It is a small restaurant, but cosy (if a little bit on the warm side). The menu offers a good amount of choice but is not at all daunting.

We started off sharing some Soy chicken, which were good, but a fairly big portion for just one person, and the japchae (delicious) and vegetable mandu (brilliant). The pork bulgogi was incredibly good, possibly the best I have had. It was all presented well; you mix up the meat and rice with the sauce and stuff it into the lettuce leaves, which makes for a filling tasty meal.

The service was slightly on the slow side but the food was all so good and the waiter was helpful so we didn't really mind a bit of a wait. This will definitely become one of our regular haunts and we look forward to coming back again.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We love the Kim chi chigee (the preserved cabbage soup) as it came with rice. The chapchae was ok and the bugolgi both beef and the chicken, I personally enjoyed the beef better.

The only thing is that it looks like there were only one or two waitress/waiter there to serve so when it is busy over lunchtime, you do have to have a little patient.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

For London it stands out as great value for money and generous portions with quality to match.

I don't like the next table practically sitting in my lap when eating, but of course this is a personal thing and other folk may not mind this.

1691,aza484,Lime Orange,3.0,Disappointed in the decline over last 6 months,"When we discovered this local, family-run Korean place 2 years ago it immediately became a big hit with our office - multiple trips per week to begin with, and then settling at a consistent weekly or fortnightly visit ever since. I would bring friends & family here when visiting the city for the weekend, and advocate people go out of their way even to seek it out. Their yangyeum chicken starter was to die for, their bibimbaps tasy, and their pork bulgogi especially good.

Unfortunately, my regular lunch pal and I have noticed a steady decline in portion size and food quality over the last 6 months or so, alongside a slow rise in prices. We have often remarked before while dining here, how pleased we are that this brilliant little friendly restaurant had not succumbed to the trend only too often seen at local establishments that gain popularity - that temptation to try to further increase profit margins by switching to cheaper cuts of meat, changing suppliers (and suffering a noticeable dip in quality), and getting stingy with portions. Unfortunately this has now happened.

First our beloved yangyeum chicken - previously so good that we had visited and ordered only two portions of this delicious starter each as our meals - was switched from a generous pile of easy-to-eat boneless chicken (thigh I'd guess?), to chicken wings instead - without any change to the menu I should add. Next, the generous portion was downsized to just 5 wings (tested on multiple occasions for consistency). And finally, the price was actually INCREASED.

Now many people very much enjoy chicken wings, so what's wrong with that, you might ask? Well, for the tourists who might wander in once on their visit to see Buckingham Palace, absolutely nothing. But for those living or working locally, we know better. We know what came before. And I'll tell you this for nothing - bitesize pieces of dark meat are far easier to eat cleanly with chopsticks while on an office lunch break or having a business meeting, than fiddly little battered wings smothered in a very sticky spicy-sweet sauce.

We've also observed a decrease in the bibimbap sizes, smaller portions of accompaniments, increased greasiness and lower quality of meats (e.g. the belly pork), and further subtle price increases across the menu.

I think we feel particularly strongly just because of how much love we had for this place initially, and what a stark contrast there is. The first time we went after they'd made the thigh to wing switch, the waiting staff actually apologized to us for the change when we ordered, knowing full well we'd be disappointed. Now, they simply look at us apologetically when we arrive in the doorway.

Sadly, while we've really been trying to keep coming, our regular visits may now have come to an end, the decline has crossed a threshold.

Like many of the best things in life, it seems it couldn't last forever.

TL;DR - if you're in town for the weekend, fancy some Korean and are in the area, you could do far worse than Lime Orange. If however you've been before and loved it, say a year ago or so - don't come back, you'll be sorely disappointed.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0
1692,호경 김,Lime Orange,5.0,Great first time Korean experience,"Visited with friends and was blown away from the quality of the food and the explosion of flavours.

I wasn't expecting much when my friend took me there but was so glad he did.

The Bibimbap i had included 7 vegetables and beef. (Vegan options available)
My friend had the spicy pork ribs which were great too.

Prices are on the cheap side considering its in Victoria which is a huge plus.
Would definitely recommend.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

Service a little slow, although if you intend to make a whole evening of it then that's not really a problem. Small restaurant, I'd advise booking as it's clearly popular at the weekends.

1712,Monty M,Lime Orange,3.0,First time in Korea; interesting experience,"As a Korean-eating virgin, this was a new one on me and chosen primarily as a lunch venue because of its proximity to Victoria station.

The reason for lunch was a quarterly meeting with an ex-client who has become a friend and we enjoyed the experience.

The service was excellent after we explained our inexperience, but found it difficult to eat our pork belly in lettuce parcels with rice, so reverted to normal eating practices.

The restaurant was busy and the clientele interesting although the tables were very close together, making it feel like a cafe more than a restaurant. That meant I marked it down from a four-start to a three-star experience.

This is an excellent place to eat decent food when travelling to and from Victoria station, especially because of the other execrable restaurants in the area, but probably not worth travelling too far for.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

When I came the place was quite empty, I was welcomed by very friendly waiter and sat next to the window. In a few minutes all spaces were taken and the place was buzzing, but the only waiter was speedy, nice and paying everyone equal attention.
I am a huge fan of Korean food, growing up in the country with lots of Korean expats, so I browsed through the menu and appreciated the selection.
I haven't had bibimbap in ages so opted for it with extra kimchi. When it has arrived, all bright and colourful on the sizzling hot plate, along with some miso on the side and hot sauce I thought it was too beautiful to eat. At the end, the dish ended up being glorious, with all ingredients fresh and flavourful. Definitely recommend.
The also have a lunch special that is different every day, which I think is a great value.

I had found this little gem through Google suggestions by checking what Asian restaurants were nearby and decided to give this place a try based on the impressive 4 star+ reviews.

The first time I visited Lime Orange I got dinner take out. The restaurant was packed on a weekday night, and once I walked in, the food smelled authentic and right. I got the beef bibimbap (mixed rice bowl), and it was delicious! I had gone back several times afterwards, and also tried dining at the restaurant. Other dishes I enjoyed were the japchae (glass noodle stir fry), dukbokgi (rice cake in spicy sauce), pa jeon (seafood pancake), and tofu soup.

Just a gentle reminder that for those dining in, try and avoid wearing knits because the restaurant does have bbq and grill options, and the smell can ""stick"" to your clothes. Service is friendly and prices are reasonable. They do take rsvps, except between 6:15pm and 7:30pm.

It's a small Korean food place.

Narrow room with tables down one side so atmosphere is limited, but don't let that put you off as the food really is Top notch and very reasonably priced.

The chicken starter we had was served pipping hot and very tasty. The main was served with obvious fresh vegetables and again tasty, fresh and hot.

The prices were good .... starters from 4-8 quid and mains from around 9 quid upward. Sides a couple.of quid.

Service was quick, friendly and efficient.

A meal for two with starters, mains and a beer was basically 50 quid. Not bad for central London.

In summary

Food quality ..... superb
Taste ..... very
Service .... quick and efficient

1759,ECOD1,Lime Orange,5.0,Delicious Korean Experience,"I used trip advisor to find a restaurant suitable for a theatre dinner. Lime Orange seemed a good choice, and we were delighted with this tiny place. I would never have entered the restaurant had it been by looks alone, as the exterior is not very inviting but once inside the door the room was clean, quite smart and we were shown to our table by a very polite and friendly waiter. We got a table at 5.30 with ease, and soon after the tiny restaurant quickly filled up. We were given advice about food choices. The BBQ chicken was delicious and sizzlingly hot, and the pork bibimbap was equally good. Although we ordered rice with the chicken, we didn't need it as we shared both dishes, and there was plenty for two ladies.
The service was very quick and friendly as they are very used to people going to the Apollo Victoria theatre which is immediately across the road. Ignore Google maps advice as that will direct you to the back entrance!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1760,Christine B,Lime Orange,5.0,A Pre-'Wicked' Treat.,"The exterior of this Korean Fusion restaurant is rather uninspiring. Do not be put off by this!
We had read reviews online so knew it had a good reputation. We were not disappointed! From the moment we met our charming host and were led to our table, and through the variety of dishes, we felt relaxed and welcome.
The food was delicious. We shared a dish of Kimchi followed by Hot Stone Pot Biminbap and a Spicy Chicken Bulgogi with fresh lettuce on the side.
We arrived early ( pre-show) and did not reserve a table. From 18.30 it would be necessary to book as the restaurant filled up rapidly.
It was a thoroughly enjoyable meal.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1761,glennosaurus,Lime Orange,5.0,Korean delight,"On the 11th of July 2016 we had tickets to see the Wicked theatre show. After picking up our tickets at the box office we were looking for a quick but good quality meal before seats opened for the show and a place close to the Apollo Victoria Theatre.

Based on Tripadvisor reviews we chose to visit Lime Orange with a family of four, two adults and two daughters, one hour before seats open for Wicked. We ordered fried calamari for starters, then bibimbap, soup and noodles with fried chicken. Everything was tasty and stupendous in flavour, texture and temperature.It was our first experience with Korean food, but based on this first encounter I'm sure more will follow. Our daughters, who at first protested as we were visiting 'asian again', really loved the tasty food. Service was fast and helpful and accommodating. Highly recommended!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1766,AnnaG5,Lime Orange,5.0,"Great food, great value for money, great little gem!!!","I'm shocked that I have lived in this area for over 10 years and have only now discovered this wonderful local restaurant! It's conveniently located right next to Victoria Station, but unless you are visiting the Apollo theatre (right opposite) or are a commuter taking the bus outside the restaurant, it's easy to miss. Vauxhall Bridge Road certainly isn't the most scenic road, so probably not too many people just going for a stroll in the arae..However, I can only recommend taking a detour for this little gem.

All the dishes I have ordered so far have been excellent, I particularly liked their Japchae. Every day they have a different special lunch dish and for £3.99 take away or £4.99 eat-in it's incredible value for money. For London in general, but particularly for this area. Portions are generous!

It's casual dining at it's best. The furnishing may be simple, but the ambience feels relaxed and somehow always has a calming effect on me. Even when the restaurant is packed. This may also be thanks to the wonderful staff, always very friendly,quick and helpful.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1767,ongmich,Lime Orange,4.0,Great Korean food in London!,"The restaurant is conveniently located near to Victoria Station, just behind the Wicked Theatre. Nice restaurant ambience and great service staff! The food was also really good e.g. the bibimbap.

We ordered a mixture of starters and then all had a main and we were stuffed full as the portions are a good size, and we couldn't stop eating!

Would definitely come back here. The staff were so lovely and didn't rush us once even though we waited a long time for our 3rd party member to join us.

I am a regular,"It might not be the kind of place to take your bird on a first date, but a fantastic place to go for a work lunch. Food is good - some of the best Korean food I have eaten in London. Decent price. It can be busy, so it may be worth booking ahead if there are a few of you.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1773,Geoff E,Lime Orange,4.0,Good food and got a seat straight away!,"I was taken here by a friend. We shared two starters. Both were excellent. I having never had Korean food I was unsure but this put me at ease. For mains we had be sizzling bowls of veg with an intact egg yoke. Mine also had chicken. This was filling and interesting. But not quite at the same level of yumminess but fully palatable and filling. Maybe owing to my own eating style by the end the food had blackened to the metal bowl and was less tasty. To be fair this was just the dregs so shouldn't put people off the food. For desert we had green tea ice cream... the taste of this was excellent. What was more questionable (and I think a marmite option) was the texture. It had green tea in it so was bitty. I am still undecided if I liked it. My friend definitely didn't. However two colleagues at work both said they love the bits! So I guess try and see its only a couple of quid.

I would come back, Korean food was tasty filly and fresh.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1774,PLeung8,Lime Orange,4.0,Very good Korean food,"We visited as a group of 4 adults and 4 children and found the service and food to be excellent. We didn't book as we turned up when it opened but by around 6 on a Thursday night it was very busy. Not sure if the staff were on different shift patterns, but the waiter was extremely busy on his own for the 1st hour which was OK for us as we was the first ones in so no issues with service.
Jap Chae (Glass noodles) was a bit small for £6.70 for a starter but it was very flavoursome.
Bimbibap was excellent and very tasty. BBQ meat was also very good and tasty. Lighting was a bit dark which meant sometimes it was a little hard to tell if the meat was cooked.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

I had expected similarity to Chinese food but I was very wrong.

The bibimbap I had was fantastic, 8 vegetables with egg yolk and chilli sauce, and the fun part was that you had to mix everything in to get the full flavour.

The staff were very friendly too, explaining all the best selling dishes and recommending a few to the kids who had no idea what they wanted.

Overall, a very pleasant experience.

1795,winterbellaa,Lime Orange,4.0,Casual and Decent Korean Restaurant in SW area,"I came to know this restaurant after a series of research in narrowing down the best Korean restaurants that fits our criteria (including price range, location, atmosphere etc). I was a little sceptical at the beginning, as there weren't a lot of reviews on Tripadvisor for this place despite the high ratings. To be fair, Lime Orange isn't one of the most well-known Korean restaurants in town, but we like how it is one of the few that's close to my friend's hotel at South Kensington (as most Korean restaurants are gathered around Tottenham Court Road/Holborn area). The restaurant itself is very easy to find as it is located on the main road, right opposite Apollo Theatre (known as the theatre for Wicked the Musical). Price range is also very reasonable, and the quality of food is no less than that of the better known Korean restaurants (such as Kimchee). The portion of food is also very decent. For appetizers, we had jap chae (a small dish of Korean glass noodles, it was the best jap chae I had in London), vegetable mandu (5 Korean dumplings, they were very crispy) and a small bowl of kimchi (it was quite spicy, but it would be better if there was more depth in flavour rather than spice alone). For main course, we had a beef bibimbap, a kimchi soup pot (which actually gives you a complimentary bowl of rice, but it isn't specified on the menu. I quite like the pork that comes with it) and fried seafood udon (I like the flavours and the wide variety of seafood). Between the four of us, we had a really enjoyable meal as it was a nice casual place to dine and chat. The only downside for us is that the staff could have been a little bit more attentive by serving water regularly or perhaps just look around more often, otherwise everything was perfect. In general though, the staff there are all very friendly. On a final note, the bill came down to £40, which was 10 quid/pp. You definitely get more than you pay.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1798,Terry P,Lime Orange,4.0,Excellent location for the theatre,We had lunch in the restaurant which is right opposite the entrance to the Apollo Victoria theatre. The surrounds seem a bit basic but the food was tasty and the service excellent. Dishes are Japanese/Thai/Korean and the portions are generous.

1800,Suzy2110,Lime Orange,4.0,Nice meal,"Nice meal in a great location. The food was presented well and was tasty. I had seafood pancakes for my starter- it was far too big a portion and would have filled me on its own! I did not finish it- the starter was tasty but a bit stodgy. I did not like the chili sauce they gave us to accompany the meal.

My main course was a pork dish served with rice and lettuce. This was tasty. Again, presentation was good.

A two course meal for two with one of us having sake and one of us having two bottled beers came in at around £40- for central London that's terrific value.

The restaurant is quite basic on the inside and the toilets were pretty shocking, they looked like they hadn't been cleaned for quite a while and there was a bit of a smell. That's my main reason for not giving a 5 star review.

It's not a posh restaurant but it was tasty, filling and service was good. Recommended if you're on a budget.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

Would definately recommend.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1803,willy26,Lime Orange,4.0,Daily Specials and a bowl of kimchee = a good lunch for £8.20,"I have come here for lunch many times.

But haven't got past the three favourites
Monday daily special Chicken Katsu and Udon noodles
Wednesday Spicy beef soup, which is a chili-oil flecked consommé soup with bean sprouts, scallions, bits of beef and slices of a mild winter vegetable. I drown the accompanying bowl of rice in it.
Both go great with a side order of Kim Chee, the healthy cabbage and chili.
The total damage then is about £8.20.

They do Bibimbap very well. That works out at around £10. The Tofu option was my favourite they also do chicken, beef, pork or seafood. Only seafood untested, others fine too.
Service is quick and courteous. Place gets full though. Best advice is to arrive early, like 12 to 12.15. Solo diners have a stool and bar looking out of the window option. Place is near Victoria Station. Due to Crossrail civil engineering project, this area has become a bit of a food desert. Lime Orange is recommended.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

Although the restaurant is pretty small, narrow and pretty busy when we arrived, it still felt like we had enough room and could talk without needing to raise our voices over others.

The service was attentive, very polite and even though they were dealing with a busy pre-theatre crowd, we did not feel rushed at all. The menu is quite extensive, almost too much so, with Sushi, Chinese and other types of cuisine finding its way in but having not tried the more traditional Korean dishes before I went for a Bibimbap, which was excellent, even if I would usually prefer a slightly larger portion of chicken in it.

My wife had the Salmon and we shared a starter, which were both delicious and even when you include the drinks we still only paid £35. I would definitely come here again, regardless of going to the theatre or not.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We began with rice cakes and fish cakes in a sauce and squid which were nice but nothing special. We followed these with a pork and beef bibimbap. The highlight was the cucumber kimchee with pear. The cabbage kimchee was rather lacklustre. All in all probably good for the office workers nearby but not particularly relaxing. We drank a hite beer and a rice drink,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

1815,Bethanie1606,Lime Orange,5.0,"Beautiful, authentic, Korean food.","I called up yesterday (Wednesday) morning and booked a table for 6pm as was seeing Billy Elliot in the theatre opposite. I booked this with an open mind and was blown away! It's a very small, intimate restaurant that appears to be family run. I had the japchae to start which was beautiful, even if I was the only person in the restaurant to eat with a fork! My partner had the deep fried prawns which were MASSIVE! They looked beautiful but our main meals came out before we'd finished our starters so I didn't get to try the prawns. For main I had the beef bibimbap. I am so glad I went with the crowd. This dish was DELICIOUS. Rice with egg, tasty beef, spinach, onions - absolutely delicious and fun because you get to mix the ingredients and add sauce to your tasting. My Partner had pork belly with lettuce (taco-style). He said his meat was a bit gristly but the flavours were really good, as were the dipping sauces. It is very fast service here which was great as within an hour we had a starter, main, beer, and sake. In total we spent £53 which is a little pricey but definitely worth it for a treat. The sake wine is delicious, as is the Asahi beer. The restaurant picked up in business by about 6.30/7 and had a really nice atmosphere to it. If I go to Victoria Palace Theatre again, I'll be sure to stop here to try something new!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

1818,July r,Lime Orange,5.0,"Friendly and efficient service, delicious food","I was able to book a table, the day before my visit, which was a good thing because the restaurant was busy.
The staff was friendly and my friend and I didn't wait too long to get our food.
This was my third time eating in a Korean restaurant (first two in Paris) and I can tell that the food was as delicious and flavoured as in the other ones ate in. My only bad point, would be the Korean tea, I was expecting something more impressive, with more flavours. As for my friend, after having had a not so good experience with bibimbap in another korean restasuranrt, the one she ordered at Lime Orange (seafood bibimbap), completely changed her mind about Korean food (in a positive way :) ).

Overally everything was worth the 10% service charge","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1819,satellina,Lime Orange,4.0,Great unusual flavours,"Really enjoyed our first Korean meal. I had a starter only which was huge. The other two had a big hot bowl, one seafood based, the other meat. The portions would easily have done for two.The chili sauce was served separately so that you could add your own...a vg idea! Very friendly prompt service and reasonably priced. We were there early evening pre theatre and there were plenty of free tables. We loved the green tea ice cream...delicious! Look forward to another visit.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1820,Marek197X,Lime Orange,3.0,Blandness...the worst sin for Korean food...,"Find yourself hungry in the Victoria station neighbourhood, and it’s easy to get very depressed very quickly. On offer is the worst that British megachains have to offer (Nando’s, etc.)… and little else.
In that context, we were very happy to find Lime Orange. The fact that the restaurant was packed was encouraging, so we decided to dive in.
I really wanted to like the place, but left disappointed. The problem was that everything we had was desperately bland and lacking in taste. We started with the fried sweet and sour fried chicked. The sweet taste of the sauce decidedly overpowering any chicken that may have been there. Then came the seafood pajeon (korean pancake). It was very anticlimatic, and clearly undercooked. When this was pointed out, they took it back and brought another one after a while…which was not much better. We’ve had much tastier in other places (Asadal for example).
Then came the bibimbaps (we had pork and beef), which seemed to be what everyone comes for…
This too was so bland we almost cried. My girlfriend had to shower hers in chili sauce for her tastebuds to feel something…anything….
It was all just sad.
To Lime’s credit, the portions are generous and we did not leave hungry, nor did our evening break the bank.
Did we leave satisfied ? That’s another story….","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

London food not bad, but when you have deep fryed food and bread for 5 days in a row, it has a toll on your body.

The reviews on here and my friend made me expect more than it was.

We got a table (eventually) and they really rushed us through. They kept trying to get us to pay the bill but we were still talking - there wasn't anyone waiting for a table so I wasn't sure why they hurried us.

They offered a good value set lunch, 3 courses and a glass of wine for £17, but we were already eyeing up some of the different starters. My friend had been before and highly recommended it.

We had the fried kimchee tofu, spicy fried chicken to start and beef bimbimbap and pork belly bimbimbap. Along with some cold kimchee and miso to accompany the mains.

My friend asked for lettuce instead of rice and they were more than obliging. We finsish with a scoop each of the black sesame and green tea ice cream. Black sesame was a real treat. Ask for no topping!

One of my colleagues got the beef Bulgogi special and said it was ""ok."" High marks for the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi, though.

I liked that the place wasn't too crowded even at 1PM and we could get a table right away.

The food was good and the prices reasonable. The only areas for improvement are to start taking credit cards (cash only) and make it easier to get the wait staff's attention.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1842,LanceSoup,Lime Orange,4.0,Authentic Korean with good service and reasonable prices,"I have eaten at Lime Orange a few times now over the last couple of years. As I am on business I normally dine alone. It is a small restaurant and most of the customers are Korean. The first thing that you notice is the attentive service. You are greeted and seated immediately you walk in by very polite, friendly staff. When you are ready to order a waiter or waitress appears straight away and if you look up because you need something else you are quickly attended to. The menu includes Korean favourites and, curiously, a sushi selection. The food is tasty and arrives very quickly. Wine is about the cheapest you will find in this part of London.

We had two cups of Korean tea at £1.80 each and were surprised to find that there were no free refills. Also, in all Korean restaurants there are complimentary nibbles (kimchi, whitebait-like fish, etc). Here the kimchi was a pricey £2.00.

1859,wwltstw,Lime Orange,1.0,Meh...,"My friend and I went to Lime Orange on a Friday evening for a pre-theatre meal. I was very excited about dining here due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Google. However, we left feeling disappointed and did not feel like we had our Korean food fix.

We started with the kimchi jeon (pancake), which was sickly sweet. The pancake was loaded with spring onions and very little kimchi. With the negligible amount of kimchi in the pancake, they might as well rename the dish 'spring onion pancake with traces of kimchi'. My friend and I joked about the chef mistaking sugar for salt.

My main was a seafood soup dish with rice. It was ok but nothing memorable; hardly any seafood, apart from the tiniest pieces of squid.

We ordered green tea ice cream for dessert. The ice cream was drizzled with lots of strawberry sauce. This was not described in the menu. They should have served it on the side. The sauce was super sweet. Fortunately, the waiter was happy to replace the ice cream, this time without the sauce. The ice cream itself, although very enticingly described in the menu, was not good at all. It wasn't smooth and had bits of ice in it. It tasted cheap.

Overall, very very disappointed. We went to Lime Orange with high expectations, but the food for us was unfortunately a bit meh...","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

Menu exciting and varied - both Japanese and Korean options and waiter advised on how to choose and select options. Unfortunately I must have chosen a duff off the menu as my Katsu Chicken Udon was far noodles with some deep friend chicken on it. The 'special sauce ' accompanying it was - I swear - Hp brown sauce. Still Udon noodles were tasty. Perhaps I just choose the wrong food but rest of table said things were nice but not great. Unfortunately I think it's a case of a restaurant getting away with serving poor food to a tourist market (it's right near Wicked and Billy Elliot). Touch too expensive for what we got.

Unfortunately, the food was cold by the time we brought it back to the office (we're not very far from the restaurant either) but it tasted great. Given the portion size and that it's only £4 for the special, I'd definitely go back and try another special of the day again.

If you happen to be working around the area, it's very close to the station and you probably have to wait about as long as queuing up to pay for a sandwich at Pret. I would definitely recommend it and I will be visiting again very soon.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The noodles were lukewarm and tasteless. We ordered seafood and vegetables, but the only vegetables were a few peppers and onions.

The menu is quite extensive and we didn't really know where to begin. Thankfully someone in our party who had been there before ordered for us and we were treated to some truly delicious dishes.

The Japchae (sweet potato noodles) and Beef bulgogi were particular favourites with us but everything we tasted was truly delicious and, quite importantly, not over-salted. Portions were super generous and we could have probably ordered less than we did, but we're grateful we got to try so much.

Next time I think we'll go for two rounds of Japchae, the beef Bibimbap (which is a comforting big stone pot of rice with meat, veg and a raw egg yolk which cooks in the heat of the pot) and the Beef Bulgogi.

It's not super cheap but it's good value for the size of the portions and the overall quality.

We can't wait to go back!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The service from the staff is great and the food is delicious, fresh and quick to come out of the kitchen. Also as a vegetarian I felt there was a decent amount of options for me which is always a huge plus.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1877,KMMC,Lime Orange,5.0,Hidden Gem,"I have eaten here twice in the last month. The first time was in a group of 6 before seeing Billy Elliot. The waiter was very patient with us explaining the menu & happily explaining what everyone else was eating as we were looking around. He recommended the Kimchee Jeon as a starter which was delicious. The tempura was plentiful. I'm a vegetarian and had the hot stone pot Tofu Bibimbap. This is a bowl of rice, vegetables and tofu. There is a raw egg yolk on the top that cooks as you mix it all in with chilli sauce (you do this yourself so choose how spicy you want it!). It was delicious!

The second time I took my God-daughter as we were seeing Wicked. It's literally over teh road. I had the same again (it was so delicious first time around) and she had the fish Bobimbap - there was plenty of different types of fish and she loved it. Once again brilliant service and delicious food.

Some advice definitely call up and book in advance. It's so busy and popular. We booked both times, lots of disappointed people or people who had to wait. It's quite small so there's not lots of room to wait in. Also they prefer cash - they do take cards.

So I highly recommend it, great food, service and atmosphere plus it's so close to both shows.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1878,balts,Lime Orange,4.0,Fantastic little find,"This is a great Korean restaurant in the heart of London. It may not look like much from the outside but inside the food is spot on. Everything that my party had was very fresh and clean tasting - exactly what you expect from Korean food.

Perhaps the only let down was that we ordered BBQ and thought we could cook it ourselves on the grill but it came pre-cooked - thankfully it was delicious!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1879,RevJohnK,Lime Orange,4.0,'Pleasant surprises await you',This is a small Korean restaurant. It was welcoming and friendly and made you feel at home.

1880,joker_mack,Lime Orange,5.0,A delight,"Arrived for Pre theatre lunch, greeted by the hostess promptly who gave a wonderful and friendly service. First Korean restaurant experience and help in choosing from the gorgeous selection in the menu was given with a smile. The food was fresh and beautifully presented. Sake was a definite acquired taste but when taken as a shot disappeared quick lol. I cannot fault my time at this restaurant and recommend it highly, it opened at 12 and we were the first in the door, followed to a virtual full house within 30 minutes so booking could be adviseable.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1881,J_fleur84,Lime Orange,4.0,A Korean feast,"This is the first time I’ve visited the restaurant and wasn’t disappointed. It’s a fairly small restaurant and as we went there early on a Tuesday we didn’t have an issue getting a table. The restaurant is a stones throw from the entrance of Victoria Station, so nearby for the Apollo theatre.

The waiters were helpful and showed my friend how best to eat her dish, and also added advice as to how to make mine taste the best. The advice was gratefully received! I went for the tofu bibbimap (?) which was very tasty and it was nice not to have plain tofu!

The dishes were also reasonably priced, along with the beer too.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1882,Ggirl78,Lime Orange,5.0,Fantastic first time korean experience,"My Daughter and I visted Lime Orange pre-theatre after I saw the good reviews on tripadvisor. Im glad to say we were not disappointed, the restaurant is small but despite there being a lot of diners it didnt feel crowded. The waiter who served us was friendly and welcoming offering tips on the food.

The food was amazing, I had seafood Bibimbap which was delicious packed with flavour and came with chilli sauce to add to taste, my Daughter had Katsu Udon Noodles which we both agreed was the best katsu we had tasted and there was plenty of it. The prices were really reasonable too, approx 8 - 10 for a main meal and soft drinks a bargain at £1.50.

Our new years resolution is now to learn how to use chop sticks as we were too embarrassed to ask for a fork !

Thank you for a lovely dining experience which was one of the highlights of our trip.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

But a friend took me and assured me it was delicious. The staff were friendly and gave lots of useful information about the dishes. The menu was varied, quality was great. I opted for chicken bibimbap which was fun and tasty. The prices are really good, especially considering the central location. I'll certainly be going back!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

I had the King prawns for starters that were cooked in a tempura batter, they were huge and delicious. For main I had the chicken biibimbap which was absolutely lovely, very flavoursome. Very reasonable prices, the staff were attentive but not too much, thankfully. I cannot recommend this little restaurant highly enough. if you want good, tasty Korean food this is the place for you. Probably best to book first as it gets very busy.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

Highly recommended","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1886,EmelieHzb,Lime Orange,5.0,Best Korean in London!,"We've been to Lime Orange 3 times, and we always leave very satisfied! The bibimbap is delicious and very filling. But the highlight of this restaurant is probably the Korean Barbecue! You can chose to grill your meat yourself, which is a very fun experience. All the bulgogi meats are tender and full of flavour. The kimchee pancake as a starter is superb, as is the black sesame ice cream for dessert!
On top of delicious and fresh food, the staff is great and friendly. We only have great things to say about this place - there is definitely no need to go to more expensive or busy Korean restaurants in Soho!!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1887,MrVilliers,Lime Orange,4.0,Excellent last minute lunch choice,"Friends at work had suggested somewhere else to support as part of the AmEx Shop Small campaign, but then I found this place and we managed to book a table.

We arrived and the place had a queue, which is always a good sign. We were seated at our table and given menus to begin analysing. There may be a lot of there but it all sounds great and judging by the food we all received, it's all done to a decent standard. We tried a range of dishes, including the Raw Beef Bibimbap, Chicken Katsu Udon, Salmon Teriyaki and Yukgae Jang, and teverything we had was bursting with flavour and well prepared. This is good Korean food, with plenty of options to include everyone (now also very curious about their sushi too)

The prices are reasonable and the staff are very friendly. It's quite a small restaurant and they do recommend on their website to book in advance. Having seen how busy it gets, I would definitely agree.
We all agreed, we would definitely be back.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1888,Paul S,Lime Orange,5.0,"First rate but inexpensive, attracts repeat trade.","This place is not expensive, but very high quality - there seem to be a lot of Koreans who eat there, and many people who are repeat trade dropping in for a very quick meal.. The classic Korean dish bibimbap was fantastic, and seems to be especially popular, but it's a very large portion for one. The wine was great too. We'll definitely be going back. It's very easy to get to - very near to Victoria station.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1889,Stephen B,Lime Orange,4.0,Authentic Asian food,Ideally located for Victoria's theatres. The food is plentiful for the price and really authentic and tasty.

1890,SK8,Lime Orange,4.0,Very tasty,"Popped in for an early dinner before a gig and to sample our first taste of Korean food. We were not disappointed! There was plenty to chose from on the menu and the staff were happy to advise choices to our taste. We shared some chicken dumplings to start which were lovely. I had the pork bulgogi which was really, REALLY good! I had it with lettuce and rice as advised (and costs extra); you wrap it and eat with your hands - yum. It was a big portion and I thought the rice was unnecessary - but the lettuce was a nice fresh way to serve and enjoy the pork and I might try it at home. The other half had katsu chicken with udon noodles - it was also really tasty and a good generous portion. We were both chuffed, especially as he works a stones' throw and will be able to pop in and enjoy the lunchtime specials. Location is very convenient for Victoria, just a 2 minute walk, behind the Apollo theatre.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

It doesn't look much but don't be fooled. We booked for 5pm, when they open and for first 15mins we were the only ones there but it soon started to fill up so booking is a must. The waiter was attentive & helpful but not intrusive, recommending dishes etc. The food was lovely and very tasty and it was very filling. I thought the prices were reasonable, 2 starters, 2 main courses, 3 sides, 2 puddings, large glass of wine, coke & bottle of water was £55 inc service charge.

Dinner was absolutely lovely and we had a great time chatting even after finishing our meal. We stayed in Lime Orange until all other diners have left. We left the restaurant at 10:50pm and then we noticed the closing time was 10:30pm!! How kind was the staff not to patronise us regarding the closing hour.

The food was tasty and good. We also ordered Beef Bibimbap and Beef Bulgogi. The waiter recommended lettuce and rice with the Beef Bulgogi and neglected to mention there was an extra charge for both the rice and the lettuce. There was also a 10% service charge added to the bill. I suggested he add a statement to the menu noting the extra charge for the rice and the lettuce. He good naturedly removed the excess charges. The 10% service charge was not amended and no record of our meal was provided following our cash payment.

The first time I thought the food was pretty good, especially the starter of spicy calamari. My main of beef bulgogi was a bit too salty, and didn't come with any lettuce.

My second visit was a few weeks later. Again I ordered the spicy calamari, which was pretty good. But this time I went for the beef bibimbap, and found it very bland.

Also both times the service wasn't very good. I waited a very long time both times before anyone came to take our orders. Also one of the times we were running late by about 10 minutes. As we were on the tube we didn't have signal to ring ahead and let them know. As we arrived, the waitress very sacasrtically said ""we're a bit late aren't you"". I wasn't impressed.

I don't think I'll be returning here, as there are many better korean restaurants in central London.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0
1904,Bernardinho9,Lime Orange,5.0,Authentic Korean Food at it's Best!,"I popped in for a quick post work feed. The staff were friendly and helpful. The atmosphere unpretentious and relaxed.

The food most importantly was brilliant! I had the calamari (some of the best I have had). The Kimchee, which is not to everyone's taste, but worth a try. Then the bibimbap... Which was incredibly tasty. Great value, service and food. Perfect for a quick feed before a late train from Victoria.

Enjoy!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1905,MrSiv,Lime Orange,4.0,A work night out with a difference..,"My colleagues and I found ourselves in SW1 for an evening before a trade show and all agreed we should try something different. Being a tripadviser geek nowadays, I took charge and came across Lime Orange. With positive reviews and nobody being overly au fait with Korean food it was decided that Lime Orange would be the place for us!

Despite some recent, rather derogatory reviews I'm pleased to say that our experience was a overall a positive one.

The restaurant itself is pretty basic but clean and welcoming, which is unfortunately not a given late'ish on a Tuesday night in London.

The staff were friendly and accommodating at the beginning. Having not tried Korean before our likes and dislikes were taken into account before recommendations were offered for starters and mains.

But after that I would have to say that service was average at best. Although the food service was rather slow, especially considering we were one of four tables in that evening, I would never complain when the food is as good as it was. However, we did outline upon arrival (at 8.30pm) that our colleague needed to leave at 9.45pm for a conference call but come 9.40pm he still didn't have his main meal. Not a problem normally but our circumstances meant this caused quite the issue.

What irked me the most was the general service, which was a shame after such a positive start. In between serving and going to kitchen the staff stood with their back to the restaurant chatting among themselves by the till. This made it nigh on impossible to place a drinks order and it took me leaning across into their conversation to get their attention for the water we had ordered 10 minutes earlier.

The restaurant bills itself as Korean BBQ and there are even gas grills built into some of the tables. Our table had one but the only downer of taking the recommendations were that none of our dishes incorporated a BBQ element, which in hindsight seemed odd and an opportunity missed by the staff.

Service aside it must said the food was very, very good. Everything was fresh, tasty and the we all thoroughly enjoyed every dish we shared from the pickled beansprouts, vegetable dumplings, extremely refreshing cucumber dish to the lemon chicken, noodles and beef - to name but a few....I think we over ordered somewhat.

Another big bonus was the price. 4 people, multiple bottles of beer, wine, two courses each and sharing sides all came in at a very reasonable price of around £20 per head.

These two final points are the reason I have bumped this up from Average to Very Good. Poor service can easily be corrected and can be down to the individuals on the night but food of this quality at this price deserves to be shouted about.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0
1906,Julie J,Lime Orange,1.0,Absolute rubbish Food and service,"We ordered Beef Bulgogi which the menu said it had fruits in it. It came just with fried beef and a few pieces of capsicum in it for £9.20. The food gave me a tummy ache after that. The service was appalling. The guy at the counter was on his phone, without a care in the world. He was quite smelly as well.

I will never go that way in my life again. Absolute rip off. I'm sorry to write this, but it was rubbish and waste of money. I don't know how people are putting good reviews on this.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

I had a kimchee pancake and chicken bibimbap. Both were brilliant in taste, texture and flavour. Simply delicious. I wasn't even hugely hungry but I somehow managed to finish the entire bibimbap which was quite large! The prices are also reasonable given the central London location.

The Steak was tiny, overcooked and fatty and the rice was just plain nothing to write home about. Although the salmon was a good size it just tasted burnt and was in a pool of soy sauce .Overall the food was very disappointing, the staff were not very helpful, it was a big disapointment after all the good reviews it got.

I would have given 5 stars except my beer came in a dirty glass and the service while not bad, could have been a little better. The young waiter was helpful, keen and took time to explain the dishes. We were served by two staff so the quality varied from ok to very good.

It has been occasions where she has purposely took hold of the siracha and has put it all over my sister's food to the point she found it too spicy. If she is reading it, YOU NEED TO KNOW WHEN TO LET PEOPLE DO WHAT THE HELL THEY LIKE WITH THE FOOD THEY ARE PAYING FOR. You may not like it but hell we are the ones paying to eat there.

I won't be going there because of another attempt of eating there, she has tried to smother my food with Siracha when I told her NO.

I had Pajeon and Bibimbap, Pajeon was crispy and lots of seafoods are mixed too, though my Korean friend told that they already prepared it a while ago and reheated (re-panfried) again now, which you never know... at least for me it was crispy and nice :-) Stone-bowl of Bibimbap was well heated so that you have a little bit of burnt rice that I really appreciate.

All the food was delicious. The service was friendly and efficient. If we are ever in this part of London again then we'll definitely go back.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1930,philadelphus,Lime Orange,5.0,First experience of Korean delights!,"Knowing nothing about Korean food we chose from the set three course menu, delicious food, nicely presented. The food was obviously freshly made to order and ingredients good quality. We were brought a jug of water without asking for it, service on a Friday evening was good. We thought that under £40 for two three course meals and one drink each was very reasonable and we were certainly well fed! Ideal place for a quick pre theatre meal. Will visit again.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1932,BNB17,Lime Orange,5.0,Superb,Visited this lovely place before a trip to the theatre. Delicious food and excellent service. Obviously family run which adds the the ambience. The traditional Korean BBQ is a must.,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1933,chicag009,Lime Orange,5.0,Excellent! Do Not Miss!,"This place is a little hidden gem! It's a small restaurant and can be easily missed. But I'm so glad we found it. The service was very good and attentative and the food was excellent! It was my first time eating Korean BBQ and the server was extremely helpful with suggestions and guidance. The food was very flavorful, the portions were generous. The sushi portion was the biggest I have ever seen! And very well done sushi! The Bibmbap was super tasty! We had leftovers and we were sad we couldn't pack them up.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1934,Luigi O,Lime Orange,5.0,Really nice,"I visited Lime Orange twice already: the first with my gf and second with family. The reception was great (they are always smiling and willing to help) and the food was different, but easy to please. Bibimbap is a must, and I would recommend the Korean BBQ together if in a bigger group! Oh, the ambient looks a little fancy, but it's cheaper than a lot of good pubs and restaurants.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1935,ZH57,Lime Orange,5.0,"Wonderful food, very friendly","After a long day this was the perfect first diner of our holidays. All the dishes were especially tasty (Udon chicken, fried buttered prawns, glas noodles, even the fried rice!). The beef Bulgogi was a special experience as you roll it yourself in a cabbage leave. Try the Korean ricewine Makgeolli: cool and milky. The service was very friendly and attentive. The kid's special wishes and dietary changes were gladly accepted. We will for sure come again.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1936,Charles R,Lime Orange,3.0,Convenient kimchi pre-theatre,"If you are seeking a quick and reasonably priced bibimbap or Korean BBQ before taking the family to Wicked or Billy Elliott, then look no further. This straight forward establishment is run very authentically by a husband and wife team.

Value for money and authenticity, this place is a good option with no immediate competition in this part of London. For aficionados, you might find the pajun a tad bit tired looking. Asadal near Holborn has nicer decor and better barbecue but this place is good if you're yearning for kimchi in this part of town.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1937,mttaylor9,Lime Orange,4.0,bibimbap oh yeah,"While strooling past Lime Orange we noticed that it was nicely crowded for a Monday and decided to check it out.

What a great decision that was.

We shared the veggie dumplings, you can pass on that.

But the Bibimbap of beef was to die for. One of the best meals we had in a week in London.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1938,Sam L,Lime Orange,4.0,"Good, Quick Korean Food","We showed up about 5:30 on Sat. evening and walked right in. Later, it became very crowded. The service was quick and the food very good, By the time we left, the service was not as fast.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1939,ManfredH83,Lime Orange,4.0,Very good food,"We had our dinner just before a Wicked show right across in the Apollo Victorian and were not disappointed. The food (as well as the drink - plum tea, yum yum) was very good.
The only downside was that one of the two waitresses had to take a break or something and one waitress being alone in a well visited place was not good. We had to wait a little to get our check but it wasn't that big of a problem.
Also, as usual with Asian restaurants, food marked as non-spicy isn't necessarily completely non-spicy so be sure to ask the staff before ordering","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1941,ste451,Lime Orange,4.0,First try of Korean food!,"myself and my wife attended the restaurant prior to a trip to see Wicked, Lime Orange is directly opposite the theatre so perfect to eat beforehand.
When we arrived it was around 5pm and the place was empty but after reading the positive reviews we went in.
There was a very pleasant male staff member in charge, we ordered starters and mains, we both had the Bibimbap for our main meals which is an authentic korean dish that comes in a sizzling dish and has lot of various ingredients......and an egg yolk, the waiter explained that you add chilli sauce and mix it all up yourself, it was absolutely delicious!

my only slight complaint is that the main meals arrived whilst we were still eating our starters (and we are by no means slow eaters!) but in fairness this my be a bit of a cultural difference and it didn't cause us any problems, (especially for the fact that the Bibimbap came in a red hot dish so retained its heat)

The overall price including some drinks was £43 which i thought very good value for central London.

We will definitely return on our next trip to London.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1942,LaurenceABZ,Lime Orange,5.0,Really good value Korean food,I had never been to a Korean restaurant before and I really enjoyed the experience. Very good main course for a bargain. And just a block away from Victoria station and its theatres.,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1943,ceciliamorrison,Lime Orange,4.0,A good find,"I really enjoyed my Korean experience and I would definitely go again. Take advice from the friendly staff as to what to eat. The dishes served to our table of 7 all were beautifully presented and the flavours of them matched this. Price was ok, and the restaurant is very close to Victoria Station and the theatres near by. It is a small restaurant plain and clean. Service was good. The toilets could have been a little cleaner and the space provided for this facility is very small. But I am not really complaining, just pointing out this fact!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1944,hellovng,Lime Orange,4.0,Surprisingly Good,"The shop looks a little shady. Initially we were not sure about it, but since there was nothing more alluring in the vicinity, we decided to go for it. To our surprise, it was really good. The korean fried rice was really good and spicy enough (for asians who love extra spiciness). Had another dish with 4 types of meat (can't remember what the dish is called) but it was really tasty as well. The meats were well-marinated.

The only thing I really hate about it is the horrible lighting, it was difficult to eat in the extremely orange lights. Aside from that, I'd totally recommend it! :)","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1945,LogiTekk,Lime Orange,5.0,A gem no to miss,"On our second night in London we felt for some asian food. I am in to korean food and my wife love the japanese kitchen. We checked TA and found Lime Orange and decided to try it. Located only 2 min walk from Victoria Station it was very easy to get to. We were there pretty early, about 17:30, and we were seated directly. Service was very nice the whole time. We had one of the set menues and some sake. All courses was perfect and you won't leave Lime Orange hungry 'cos you get big portions. It is in my opinion not pricey, especially not considering the quality of the food. Our bill came out at £55 for 5 dishes and a bottle of sake. I'm pretty sure I've found my favourite place in London here.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1946,KarlSR70,Lime Orange,4.0,Surprising,Bumped into this place and very surprised at the food for a place near Victoria station. The place was empty when we went in as they had just opened but soon filled up. Recommend the bibimbap.,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1948,EnglishroseEngland,Lime Orange,5.0,A great find,Whilst searching for somewhere close to the theatre (Victoria Apollo - Wicked) we found this great restaurant. The food was delicious and the service excellent. I have eaten Korean before but this was the best I have tasted. We had the Korean BBQ and there was plenty to eat for the five of us (3 adults and 2 children). Certainly recommend this if you are in the area.,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

1950,Charlotte2010NC,Lime Orange,4.0,"Loved the food, will be back again!","I went here solo on a Monday night and had the chicken bibimbap, it was wonderful and I ate every bite. Came back on a Tuesday and had the kimchi fried rice. It was good but not as good as the bibimbap. My favorite part about Korean food is the banchan, so on the second visit i ordered the mixed banchan (called something else on the menu) and it came with pickled bean sprouts, radish, cucumber and the green spinach-like vegetable. It was not was I was used to. What I typically love was not done right, so skip this. The cucumber was extremely vinegary and sweet, inedible. The greens and bean sprouts were ok. So my suggestion so far is to stick with the bibimbap. I'll go back again for that!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1951,Emma M,Lime Orange,5.0,Great location for pre theatre meal,"Hadn't tried Korean food before so this was a pleasant surprise. The waitress assisted us with our menu choice and although I can't remember the name of the dish we shared it was a platter of 4 different meats that came with rice and lettuce leaves - it was ideal for us.
We were going to see Wicked and chanced upon this restaurant. It was clean and all staff were polite and friendly.
Will try to make a return visit as the Bibimap looked impressive.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1952,shirleyEastMidlands,Lime Orange,5.0,A new experience,"I did some research before going in to London with my daughter for a service at Westminster Cathedral. We like to try out different cuisines so gave Lime Orange a go based on reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. This restaurant is at the 'unfashionable' end of Vauxhall Bridge Road and looks uninspiring from the outside. Step inside and it looks like a cafe, no scenic views from the window. But, the service is flawless, the food great and If you are new to this, they will advise you. Terrific fresh food, served quickly, great prices. Loved it !!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1953,Mitzi-pie,Lime Orange,5.0,So yummy!,"I visited here on a Saturday afternoon, with three others.

We all chose from the Korean menu items, with two of us having a Bibimap - an iron couldron like bowl arrived with the prepared ingredients (in my case: chicken, rice vegetables and pickled cabbage) neatly arranged, we were given chilli sauce to pour over and then mix everything together. (I really want to find an excuse to visit again so I can have another!)
The Bibimap continues to cook in front of you, so the flavour and texture developed throughout the meal. Each dish was flavoured brilliantly and tasted fresh.

While we went on a Saturday lunchtime, we didnt take advantage of the lunchtime offer as wanted to choose items from the main menu. I thought the food was priced reasonably and I noted that there were some set meals starting from about £15- which included a small gass of house wine.

I definately recommend, a great eat and so conveniently placed right by Victoria Station, The Apollo and Victoria Place Theatres.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1954,Mx247,Lime Orange,5.0,Absolutely loved this place!,"We discovered this place while looking for a place from where we could grab a bite to eat before watching the wonderful musical called 'Wicked'. That's how we discovered Lime Orange. Lovely modern decor inside, really fast wireless Internet, service with a smile and really really great Chicken Katsu Udon. I am a huge fan of Udon noodles and rarely manage to find a place that makes them just so. Needless to say I fell for this place and went right back the next day even though we weren't going to watch a musical afterwards. If you're a fan of noodles or Asian food, do give it a try! :)","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1955,DevaFalc,Lime Orange,5.0,great pre-Wicked show meal,"We got caught in the rain when waiting outside Wicked. We went round the restaurants around the theatre and we asked each one if they would server us in time for the show. The staff at Lime Orange assured us that we could dine in and make it on time to the show, and even helped us choose items on the menu that were both good and quick to make.

The food was very good and the atmosphere was also very welcoming. there were tables all the way out till the entrance door which made them very chilly. Personally I would suggested eating at a table half way or all the way in.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1956,PeterKingBrightwell,Lime Orange,4.0,Good for pre Wicked,"We had an hour before heading across the road to see Wicked.

1957,Mistahlong,Lime Orange,4.0,"Nice little restaurant, great food!","Was invited along for a lunch with colleagues and the food was sumptuous, grilled Salmon and Teriyaki sauce.

We ate here on the Wednesday before Easter and it wasn't very full (it could have something to do with the scaffolding outside I don't know) and had a really enjoyable meal. The waiter explained the menu and made some recommendations on ordering the lettuce to wrap around the meat which was very helpful as this was our first experience of Korean food. The food was excellent, well cooked and tasty although I would have welcomed a gap between our starters and main course, which arrived before we'd finished eating. Prices were reasonable for both the food and the wine and I'd definitely go back.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
1961,AmeliaEB,Lime Orange,5.0,An absolute delight!!,"The food was fabulous and the staff charming and helpful. I'm not familiar with Korean food and we were advised how best to eat it, which sauces to dip in and how to mix the starter.

A bottle of north korean vodka and a couple of beers 200USD. In fact we cam for the show but because of the low season no show until October! The staff was super friendly and nice.

1969,isa_loves,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Interesting food and atmosphere,"This was an interesting experience for me and y husband. We booked a table in advance for dinner. We've been curious for a while about North Korea, and visiting this restaurant seemed like a cheaper and safer option than traveling to Pyongyang. We especially went for the show. However, we were disappointed as there was no show that day. The waitress could barely speak a few words of English, but we understood they're not performing anymore. Such a pity.

About the food, it was actually really good. We ordered kimchi, rice with kimchi, cold noodle soup and some shrimps with vegetables (that turned out to be SUPER spicy, be aware they do like their spicy food there), 1 bottle of water and two beers, all for 78 dollars. Service was fast and apart from the uneatable spicy shrimps, everything was delicious. Waitress are kind of weird, but I felt this is because they can't speak English, you can see they want to interact but they just don't have the language skills.

Overall an interesting experience. Just the idea of meeting someone from North Korea is interesting. In the end, you'll hardly cross one of the street.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1

It was a very enjoyable experience with traditionally dressed waitresses, good food and drinks, unusual but pleasant decor and atmosphere, comfortable seating, attentive table service, polite greetings upon arrival and departure. No singing-dancing show was featured this particular evening and staff lacked sufficient communication skills outside Korean or Chinese. Kim Bap, Bibimbap and Kimchi were of excellent quality and very reasonably priced, however the Korean beer was grossly overpriced (i.e. a single 500 ml bottle costing more than most individual dishes).

We ordered the cold noodles and some other dishes on the menu and it was delicious! The north korea beer is also very nice but slightly more expensive as I don't think you can get it anywhere else.

The waitresses are pretty and talented. They serve food and in between they performed on stage from singing to dancing to even playing musical instruments!

Definitely a must visit if you want to experience north korea cuisine and culture without visiting pyongyang.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1

The food is good- must try the traditional North Korean style cold noodle. The decor is typical old style. The most unique was the concert put up by none other than the waitresses. It was colorful, lively n have a mix of traditional n new items. Watch out for the solo drum performance- my favorite. It was amazing to watch how the waitresses continue to serve whilst in between their costume changes. Pricing is relatively high for Phnom Penh standard but worthwhile for the experience. Note payment is in cash n they politely request no photos of the concert but u can chat n have photos with the waitresses.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1

1976,Yitzhak_Khoo,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,A peek into La La Land.,"I heard and read quite a few reviews about the restaurant, and I finally dropped by with a few friends while in town.

The restaurant was laid out like a typical Chinese restaurant with a stage. The waitresses wore light Hanbok (korean dress) and took orders mostly in slightly accented Mandarin. Our waitress eyed us ratherly suspiciously when we spoke in English. The menu was filled with an amalgamation of Korean and Chinese food, with the odd dog stew (unordered thus unsampled). I would say most items are overpriced in this place, but you probably already guessed it.

Still, the kimchi pancakes and seafood omelette were surprisingly tasty. We had a plate of stir-fried intestines which was delicious but chewier than old tires. Slightly disappointed by the lack of North Korean beer - we had South Korean Soju instead (fancy that).

The main highlight starts around 730-ish after the first few plates were served. The waitresses gave a warm up song and dance, distributed bouquets of plastic flowers to each table (Hell, I thought I was given one for being cute). A chubby girl sat behind the drums and delivered a heart-thumping solo. There were dances in traditional costumes; look out for the thin but dazzlingly beautiful girl who is the designated ""spinner"", her part of the dances include several whirling solo (think of a female whirling dervish you would propose marriage to, in a heartbeat)

Dragging on into the early evening, you would sample 60s karaoke korean songs (imagine very tamely-dressed Korean pop groups), a saxophone solo of ""The moon represents my heart"" by another gorgeous girl, and some more song and dances with electric guitars (we caught one girl finger-syncing to the music) and accordion (the national musical instrument for DPRK).

Overall the night was enjoyable; the food was great and the performance, enjoyable.
And although photography is forbidden during the performance, you can still take a shot with the waitress before you leave.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1

And, tried Pyeongyang style cold sweet potato noodle and fried rice with egg.

Pyeongyang style cold sweet potato noodle ( 평양냉면 ) was really nice taste for me.
And, I would like to recommend it to all who reads my review.

There will be two kind of cold sweet potato noodle.
One is with cool water ( with some sources ) and the other do not have cool water.
I tried cool water style. And, may be without water will be hot and spicy. And, my explanation is just for your reference.

But, fried rice with kimchi and egg was a bit hot and spicy. It was usual taste like in South Korea. It was not my taste. :)

Staffs ( from Pyeongyang ) was beautiful and kind. They served whole time while we finish lunch. And, I tried not to mention about political issues.

1978,travellerL6484AW,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,"More expensive than restaurants around, but still a great value.","I went there because it would be one of very few opportunities to meet a North Korean. While some others have commented that they felt ignored and felt that it might have been because they were from Western countries, I did not feel that way. I felt they were quite friendly, especially considering that the place was full and only a handful of girls had to run the entertainment, change costumes repeatedly, and act as waitresses. The girl who played the yanggeum (Korean dulcimer) and the girl who played the drums were amazing. If you consider that all the girls could speak Korean, Chinese, and at least a little bit of English, and could dance and play instrumetns and wait tables well, it is truly amazing. I was given a bouquet of flowers used during the show at the end by one of the girls (although I wasn't able to take it home). I have spent a lot of time in South Korea and in Asia in general and I can speak Chinese, so maybe I felt less culture shock in general and was able to understand some of what they were saying with other customers. They could speak English also, some more than others, but that was ok, because if one could not understand or respond well, she could get another. The restaurant is connected to the North Korean government from what I have read, the girls might come from elite families, the politics might be distatsteful, but a stand alone review should give it a very high rating. The girls were very remarkably talented and were friendly, the bibimbap was terrific. The hors d'ouevres were not remarkable, but I can't think of any time in my life where I got a show, a meal, and a cultural experience for 15 dollars including a glass of ginseng wine.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1

Even if you aren't into Korean food, the show is great, and the whole experience is so weird and unique it is worth it.

I usually am not a huge fan of Korean food, but there were several things on the menu I was surprised I really liked.

The waitresses are a bit standoffish with westerners, and they seated us in back, but one did come over to chat briefly (and probably see what our deal was).

The prices are higher than in Cambodia, we wound up paying $18 per person (we were six people) but we had a lot of beer and way more food than we could eat. Then again, they don't charge admission, so the price includes the performance.

The performances are delightfully bizarre. Kids would love it.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
1981,charlescolorado85,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,"sad, cheesy slice of north korea","went here for the show and dinner and, in some ways, its quite an experience. by luck we arrived right before the show. food was overpriced but the show was free. the food was standard korean, cold buckweat noodles, sweet and sour pork ribs, etc, and was pretty decent. the show however is the main attraction. its bizzare, like an 80s japanese pop music performance interspersed with random mini acts. the girls sing, play mozart on the violin, do some traditional dances etc, all choreographed to strobe lights and disco balls. they pretend to be happy and laugh the whole time, but you can tell they are not. in fact its known they are basically slaves and going to the restaurant is considered unethical by some, so three stars. im american and went to see north koreans with my bare eyes. one of the servers touched my hand during the meal. interesting.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1

1985,PBNut,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,"Interesting, odd & wonderful entertainment","Our last night in phnom penh and our son who lives in the city took us here for our last evening dinner.

There is a mystery to this place that is hard to figure out. The ladies are dressed beautifully and are quite friendly. We ordered several dishes (stayed away from the meat dishes) - yes they serve dog - it was all very delicious.

We were the only caucasian people there - and it was almost a full audience. Mostly korean men consuming alot of alcohol and smoking. That alone was good entertainment.

Apparently the waitresses/entertainment are from North Korea and live on the premises and are not allowed to leave. It's an odd atmosphere. Entertainment starts at 7.30 and is excellent!

Definately worth seeing; it's not advertised in the city - it's by word of mouth that you come across it or by hearing about it from a local.

Felt very safe there - dinner was 55.00 for 3 of us including 6 beer, however we chose veggie dishes . (Some dishes eg. Eel was 35.00...).

A little pricey but worth it to see the show. No photos are allowed.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1

The menu is extensive but many people make the mistake of ordering Chinese dishes. This mistake will negatively color your experience. My recommendation: order a large bowl of very special cold Pyongyang noodles (one per person as these are not sharable) and the kim chee. You will not be disappointed and you will feel that the meal and entertainment were a tremendous value.

1988,Moonshadower,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,North Korean Fantasy Feast,"If you have a spare evening in Phnom Penh don't miss a visit to North Korea! This unusual restaurant serves Korean favorites followed by a vivid floorshow.

Operated by a department of the North Korean regime, the restaurant provides a source of hard currency, a venue for propaganda and possibly more nefarious activities that benefit the DPRK.

The large banqueting hall is brightly illuminated and decorated in what might be described as ""synthetic wedding party"".

The food, conveniently pictured in a photo menu, was abundant, savory, and featured barnyard, sea and kennel-to-table (yes, dog meat) Korean favorites. Service, provided by attractive young women who also perform, was pleasant and fast, a necessity considering the imminent start of the show.

The fifty minute floorshow featured most of the all-female wait staff singing, dancing and expertly performing on a wide variety of traditional and modern instruments with an ear singeing, over-amped audio output.

Most of the guests in this busy eatery were Korean men, but Westerners and some families were in attendance. Communication with the staff is challenging absent Korean or Khmer, and one needs to accept the presence of smokers, ""minders"" and surveillance.

1991,504RichS,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Interesting experience,"Being a South Korean living in America, I was a bit hesitant to eat here, but my wife insisted. It was my first time meeting North Koreans and it was equally unnerving and exciting at the same time. They don't speak English so we ordered in Korean (they speak much differently than South Koreans, but it's understandable). The cold noodle soup (they call it ""rengmyun"") was really good and made the authentic old-fashioned way without any artificial ingredients liks MSG. They asked us about life in America and once my wife got to talking, they wouldn't leave our tableside. In fact, 2 of them stayed by our table for the entire meal, which gave me a bit of indigestion. They were obviously curious. In the end, it was a unique experience that I couldn't have at home and that was worth the price (which is more typical of what you'd pay in America for this kind of meal).

As we were there for lunch, we did not get to see the live show, but I hear it's pretty good. We did hear a couple of the servers practicing their songs for later that evening and it was awkwardly entertaining.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1

Enjoying a beer while watching a 20 year old North Korean girl rocking out to a manic drum solo is priceless.

A lot of large groups started to arrive, and we got our food before the floor show began.food was nothing special, but the show was quite good.
Seemed to be a lot of business men there leering at the waitresses, and lots of smokers.
Probably wouldn't bother going again, there's plenty of better restaurants to visit in Town.

4,HIKl1rTzrS5Pw-PLoUpvzQ,Genghis Grill,1.0,,"Before I start my review, a matter of full disclosure first: I am the contestant for this Genghis Grill's 2014 Health Kwest, a competition to lose weight over 60 days eating Genghis Grill once a day for each of those days. As part of this competition I do get a free bowl for those 60 days and must complete social media challenges for the possibility to win money at the end of the competition, one of the challenges is to complete a Yelp review. I will try to be as fair handed as possible.

This particular branch of Genghis Grill fell under new ownership a couple of months back and they have done wonderful work to update the look of the restaurant and up the skill of its employees, and it shows. The new bar and dining area are tasteful and the staff is excellent. 

Over the past 48 days, I have become acquainted with a number of the staff who know me by name and are always pleasant. Allen, Andrew, and Mike have always been skilled behind the bar and make sure my stays are pleasant and my glass of water is never empty. Arnell and the grill staff are always hard at work and always make sure my bowls are well taken care of and never burned or under-cooked. David, Martika, Hailey, and Edwin have been some of the best servers, making sure my bowls are brought to the table quickly and always greet myself and any guests with a smile and great attitude.

The food here is what you make of it, quite literally. There is a variety of meats from beef and chicken to turkey and calamari. With plenty of seasonings and loads of vegetables the real struggle is to limit yourself so your flavor combination doesn't overpower itself. This is one area of criticism. While some recipe cards are offered at the line, there could definitely be more, showing how versatile a Mongolian stir fry can be. Given the combinations, you aren't limited to just an Asian inspired meal. You can branch out to an Italian pasta dish with pepperoni and red sauce. You can do some outstanding fajitas or even a manly beef and vegetable with barbeque sauce dish. I just wish they had 1) a salad bar and 2) a buffalo sauce so you could make a buffalo chicken and vegetable dish.

My only criticisms are minor and I really enjoy the establishment. And don't let people tell you these places are grossly unhealthy, if you do your bowl right and pay attention, they can be extremely good for you. Even my vegetarian mom loves this place.",['galbigui'],0

Seating is a bit cramped, but ok. Our waiter (Travis) was fantastic. To our table really soon after getting seated. Asked if we'd ever been there (no) and took our drink order. Happy Hour (which is all day!) well drinks $2, score! 

He then took us over the main area and told us what to do. I ended up with scallops and shrimp, seasoned with salt, pepper & garlic. Water chestnuts, onions, green onions, cilantro, mushrooms. Sauce was the honey soy. All over white rice. 

Food came quickly and perfect cooked! The shrimp was tender and not dried out. The scallops were tasty too. The best part of Mongolian BBQ is that it is so hot when it comes out to you! Excellent flavor all around. My friend had the beef with the citrus sauce and enjoyed hers as well. 

Best thing is they don't make you decide if you want the all you can eat or one bowl till the end. I thought for sure I'd want all I could eat, but I was full after one bowl.

Before introducing myself to the manager, the attitude of the staff was 100% different.  Everyone was polite, attentive and really was concerned about the customer experience.  Hostesses, servers, even the guy at the buffet line were all great.  The food was much improved too!  The building no longer smelled like spoiled chicken (one of our warning signs last time), all the food in the buffet line was fresh, and when we received our food, it was cooked perfectly.  

While eating the manager came up and first thanked us for our review, and explained the standards in place, including how they prepared food (a far cry from the previous manager - who is no longer there).  Our food took a little bit longer to cook, but that's a great thing - we knew that the extra time meant (a few minutes) meant the food was prepared properly.

There was a pretty good sized meat selection, including marinated steak, which I chose. For seasoning, there were some pretty tempting choices, and I went with a couple shakes of black pepper, citrus garlic herb, and crushed red pepper. Peppers, onions, tomatoes, carrots, and surprisingly potatoes went on next, followed by some mongo barbecue, Szechuan, and honey soy sauces, and noodles.

The carrots were maybe a little too thick and crunchy, not quite cooked through, but other than that, everything was all good.

The bowl was a little small (you don't put the noodles on yourself, so you don't need a huge bowl), but I think I managed to get a decent sized meal into it. I probably could have put a little more meat in there, but I'll remember that for next time.

I had chosen a ton of veggies and fish,  well they destroyed it during the cooking process.  It looked awful and it tasted worse. I also spent the later part of my evening in the bathroom!  (not just me, hubby too) Never again will I eat at Genghis Grill...I actually thought about calling my bank and disputing the charge.

The location for this place is really good because it gets alot of foot traffic so you will see this place packed at almost all times.

I like this place better then its competitors in AZ because it caters to the nightlife eaters with Sake bombs and other drink specials.

The selection of meat and vegetables is great and you will find yourself stuck between making several dishes.  I think that if they droped the price of the all you can eat, people would be happier as they would make smaller portions of different things...but right now it feels like everyone crams as much as possible into one bowl.

The prior visit my husbands bowl was served to the table next to us but the gentleman recognized that it wasn't his and sent it away. It was eventually served to my husband although they did offer to let him make a new bowl. Honestly, no one wants to start over when everyone else at the table has their meal. It seems like once they upgraded the decor everything else went downhill. Nothing is quite as clean and tidy as it used to be and the ingredients aren't as fresh.

Probably my favorite Mongolian BBQ in the valley.  Best thing I like is the selection, and it's fresh meat not the frozen shaved stuff.  Along with the meats, they have scallops and shrimp, and that ain't too shabby in my opinion.  Then there's a huge collection of veggies , spices, and sauces.  You can play around with the sauces and create some very delicious combinations.  I love the texture of their noodles, chewy but firm.  

Atmosphere is pretty nice and the crowd that comes there is pretty chill too.  I love their happy hour, can't beat one dollar well drinks.  I also like the fact that they are open till 10 or 11 on most nights, perfect place to eat after catching a flick at the theater nearby.

2) It's hard to gauge how much spices/powders you put into your bowl... so be careful. Sometimes less is more.

Here you are master of your own pallet. You can ask them to use less or no oil to make the meal a little healthier. Choose wisely because the portions are as generous as you want to make of them! The owner is awesome and the cast and crew are ubber friendly. There happy hour specials are excellent if your a well drinker. I recommend making yourself a spicy Mongo beef.

Also, paying tip for someone that just brings you drinks is a little hard to justify. This location is no good! Today my table was numbered incorrectly and there was some confusion on delivering my tables bowls. Secondly, being a rewards member I received two emails offering me a two for $25 deal. The manager would not accept the email for the reason that it was only for their arrowhead location. Uh ok. So am I only a rewards member for one location? This is horrible service.

57,eTZg1PsI3GpFoNimUD_OjQ,Genghis Grill,1.0,,"Usually when I go to one of these Mongolian wok type places, I leave with a box and a half to go. On the other hand, this one was more expensive and I was still hungry by time I left. The bowl was tiny, the sides were limited, and the sauces were pre-made, pasty, 'meh'. In addition to that, the service was terrible. My drink didn't get refilled even once, and my friend's food sat on the line for ten~fifteen minutes before they decided to bring it over to her. And the restaurant was pretty much empty other than our table, and two or three others, so it's not like they were super busy or something. There was a group of waiters standing around the entire time, chatting obnoxiously loud and basically ignoring us, while one other girl did all the work. 

Pro's: Fresh ingredients, large variety of FRESH meats (a lot of these types of places do frozen), decent spice section, high quality ingredients in general, clean/pretty restaurant. 

Con's: Way overpriced. Tiny portion sizes. (The bowl was shockingly small to begin with, when I got it. And then it was obviously designed to have a really thick bottom to make it even shallower, as well as a wide brim - which is cheap on the restaurants part, and kind of tasteless, in my opinion.) Lackluster sauces. Horrible service. Oh, and this is more of a personal preference, but they only had udon noodles and two rice types for what you wanted as your 'side', i.e the thing mixed into your stir-fry. Everything else was atypical stuff like tortilla strips and things of that nature. Not to hate on fusion foods or anything, but if I'm going to get Asian food, I'd like more Asian selections, haha. 

These Mongolian Grill restaurants are always expensive. However, it's because you're paying for the fact that you get to eat a huge amount of food. I mean, it's just stir-fry. It's rice and vegetables for the most part. Yummy? Yes. High cuisine? Not so much. Worth sit-down prices? In this case, definitely not.

There aren't a lot of Mongolian places in AZ, but this one is at the bottom of the totem pole, in my opinion. I suggest heading elsewhere.",['galbigui'],0

Toady we walked in to the smell or spoiled chicken. Against our better judgement we stayed.  The sirloin looked oxidized, brown and as it had been out since yesterday.  And to top it off, they have turned up the grill high so they could cook faster. This lead to burnt food that was either overlooked on one plate and undercooked on another.

basically you pick the ingredients from a buffet style set up, and then they cook it on a huge open range.  Lots of meats, veggies, and spices, and a decent selection for the vegan/vegitarian crowd.

its a little pricy, about 9 bucks for a single bowl and 15 for unlimited trips, but compared to the rest of the mongolian rip offs around town this is the bee's knees.

89,7jw2VAbnGkr0GF6evuvViQ,Genghis Grill,3.0,,"Genghis Grill (in case you haven't already realized) is a mongolian grill.  You get a bowl, go the buffet line, put various meat/veggies/sauces in the bowl.  Then, you give it to the grill person and sit down.  As others have said, you don't wait at the grill - your server will bring you the food after you sit down (unlike the ubiquitous YC grill).  I would say the quality is better than YC.  Probably because the food is fresh rather than frozen.  Variety is also superior to YC - you have the usual fish ad pork, but you can also add various steak options, scallops, fish, and squid!  Awesome.  Lots of veggie options, and you can add egg(s).  The sauces are thick and flavorful.  It's also nice that you can pick from rice in addition to noodles.

My main complaint?  The portions are way small.  You can order all-you-can eat, but it's an extra $4 (maybe even $5? I don't recall exactly)...  I'm sure this is a cost-saving tactic, but jeez, stingy.",['galbigui'],1
90,3uPAF2-YwiTUN5NvVH6pIQ,Genghis Grill,5.0,,"I used to go to YC's all the time but this place has been replacing it. I am not sure why... maybe the $1 sake during happy hour?

Anyway, today there was a special for $6.99 bowls so my friends and I went. There's a variety of ingredients like bacon, sausage, pepperoni, chicken, beef, scallops, calamari, white fish, etc. Then there's the veggies and then the sauces.

The portions are definitely smaller than YC's. I still managed to get a pretty good amount of food into my bowl. At YC's, you have a bigger bowl and it's easier to smash everything into it. Here... not so much. But I found a way around it. Build a wall with broccoli and essentially make your bowl twice as big. It's a work of art and architecture in the end.

Sauces and flavors are good. Variety. Nice place to hang out with friends. :) Just make it work your buck. Pack it in!",['galbigui'],1

Yes, of course I have, I answer as I'm led to a table and I order drinks. Then I take my battered little bucket (you feel like a Unicef kid for a minute) and head to the assembly area, and here is where Genghis Grill outshines their competition.  The quality of the meats, seafood and vegetable is clearly a cut above almost every other Mongolian Grill type establishment.  Since I don't eat meat I put some shrimp and scallops in the bowl, and assemble my favorite mix.  I do not recommend cramming too much meat into your bowl -- a juvenile mistake I see made by kids with bad skin and future cardiac issues.   Take it easy on the sauces since they are laden with sodium and oil.  You will be pleasantly surprised at the volume of food that your bowl + rice/noodle mix will create.   Friendly staff and a decent selection of beers.  As others have noted, it can take time to get your check and get out the door.

Pretty much set up as a chipotle style Mongolian grill. You fill your bowls, don't let that small bowl fool you, you can pack as much as you want into it and when it is cooked, it's served in a bigger bowl. 

You pick out your proteins, veggies, and sauces all buffet style. They even have spoons on the line  to try the many different sauces they provide. 

Basically if you love a good noodle bowl that's freshly made, this place is where you need to be.

After we walked through a tiny walk way to get to the back where the buffet line started it was filled with an atrocious aroma of smoke, and heat.
Grabbing the food items looked so unsanitary. The food itself sat in the juices, like they all came from a can. With everyone in front of you touching the same slimey utensils i almost wanted to walk out. The meat was not refrigerated, and was leaky. I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt - regardless of everything my date and I experienced this far. The sauces were pre mixed, and even though you had a variety to choose from, with more than 1 cup to put it in, I still was not satisfied. They were definitely packed with sugar! 
Everything seems regulated, even down to not allowing for customers to pack their noodles in their bowl, which I personally go HAM on! 
When it came time to eat the food it was sooooo grease filled! Not what I expected at all. 

It's also hard to enjoy your food when the employees are constantly bashing their trays, bowls, and other Instruments on the floor when they're done cooking 1 bowl. 

All in all I would say this is not worth the price, time, and a review of 3 or more stars. The extra star I put on there was because of the nice waiter we had. He never let my cup go empty! On that note...try the peach sweet tea!!! Yum!

In order to get your food your server gives you a card, ours did not. The staff member made us get out of line and go back and get our cards. This seemed quite ridiculous, I suggested that we just fill out new cards.

The food was great! The service was terrible, the response from the owner was surprising as he acted like he could really care less about our experience.

Thoughts:
One, Maybe have more than one POS system for your servers. Could help. 

Two, hey server guy, you got me a water. That's it. The whole meal. A single water. Not a refill, for the one water you brought me, which was empty for ten minutes. However, had you seen it empty it had taken you probably 5-10 minutes to refill it, this being based on how long it took you to fill up the Coke for the table next to us while you sat behind the bar and talked to the rest of the staff. Our food (once again always delicious, mix the 3G with the Thai peanut sauce, it's amazing. Recommended by another server, I think his name was Steve, that guy is probably awesome, I assume he drives like a cool truck and volunteers at some charitable organization) back to our food, you didn't bring us that, another server did. 

So, in a matter of 30 minutes our server came by twice, once to bring me a water and the next to ask, Check? Well, my food is gone, my water cup as dry as the Sahara, and I've resorted now to downloading and playing some iPhone game about breaching a beach. I'm on level 100 because that's how long I've had since you last stopped by to check on me. Yeah....check. 

I try hard to not be mean, but I served for a long time and I know it's not an easy job, but it's not that hard. Especially on a Friday lunch shift. And last, after you ask if I want my check could you not stop by the hostess stand to flirt and just bring me my check? I have to make it to a movie and if I miss the previews and most likely a new Melissa McCarthy movie trailer, so help me god. 

So, after all this, will I stop coming. No, dammit no, because that sauce combo with udon noodles, shredded beef and sausage is just too damn amazing. And I always hold on to the small chance i may see Steve again and get a new recipe recommendation. Long live Steve.",['galbigui'],1

137,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog,Genghis Grill,5.0,,"Being a lifelong YC's patron, my interest was piqued when I saw there was another Mongolian bbq restaurant in Tempe.  To short-cut to the differences between the two, Genghis Grill:

-Has smaller bowls, so smaller portions as a result
-Has more selection, with more expensive types of meat and veggies such as bay scallops, calamari, and snow peas
-Is about $10 for a single bowl
-Has thicker, sweeter tasting sauces that have to be mixed in after the food is cooked (Otherwise they burn due to the sugar content).  With YC's, the sauces can be directly ladled onto your bowl and are cooked with the meat and vegetables.
-Offers alcoholic beverages, and has a cheap happy hour (Which I have yet to try)
-Does not have any free range soup or soft serve with your meal.  Drinks are provided by your server, rather than a free range soda fountain.
-Servers bring your bowl to your table, rather than waiting at the counter
-Does not offer you any waxed paper to push your meat/vegetables into the bowl so you can maximize on bowl space

Since the price is the same no matter what you get, I loaded up on seafood, getting a mix of marinated fish, shrimp, scallops, and calamari.  I got some veggies, 2 spoons of spice mixture, and a mix of szechuan, Khanzu, and ginger-citrus sauce.  While the combination tasted good itself, the thinner cuts of seafood ended up being done faster than the larger cuts.  As a result, the scallops and calamari tasted tough and overcooked while the shrimp was cooked just right.  

Service was friendly and attentive.  While I do like the bigger selection of items to choose from, I like the thinner, less sugary sauces at YC's and the bigger bowls.  It's a tough call, but I would say, if you want more seafood and higher quality meat in general, go with Genghis, but the better deal will be at YC's.",['galbigui'],1

To put that in perspective, my husband and I typically share meals.  Here, he gets regular and I get small.  The wait staff is attentive and friendly enough.  You may wait a little, but nothing terrible.  The buffet bar itself has food everywhere.  Several items that are dropped in the containers of food.  Which is understandable.  But there is no one maintaining it.  There are several men at the grill and the area is filthy.  One guy was pouring a bucket of dirty dishes into another bucket on the floor.  A couple fell out.  One of the cooks stepped away from cooking.  With his gloved hand, picked the bowl up off the floor, tossed it in the bucket that is on the floor and then stepped back to cooking.  It was mentioned to the guy who asked us for sides and he did ask him to change his gloves.  Trying to eat lighter I got the chicken.

Since we didn't have much time, we ordered the Chicken Teriyaki, Mongolian Steak, and Sesame Beef signature bowls. 

It didn't take too long to get our food, but I was a bit surprised by the relatively small size of the bowls. Nonetheless, the Chicken Teriyaki was tasty with a little kick of pineapple. The dish was a tad oily, and my family also commented on the oiliness (is that a word?) of their bowls.

The service is always amazing here and as quick as it gets for a place that's constantly packed. 

The good thing about this place too is you can literally always try something new for exactly the same price. You also don't have anyone but yourself when you're food isn't that great (it's always great though). 

A few of my favorite sauce combos:
If you like it spicy try the Cajun seasoning with dragon sauce 

If you like it garlicky try the garlic sauce with garlic salt 

If you like it spicy and tangy go with the kangpoa 

If you like it sweet to with teriyaki and sweet and sour sauce. 

If you're trying to be healthy instead of rice or noodles go with cabbage (what u always go for). 

There is quiet endless options here. You can never go wrong. My favorite is the Cajun chicken and sausage! I always get those. At dinner time I always throw in some shrimp.

Walked in and they greeted us right away. Got a table right by the grill. Interesting place. They have a bar area and a grill area but nothing about the place stood out to me. 

So I found out that they have little tags at the table that you bring to the grill. So you basically give them you name and your bowl size then get your bowl and fill it with meat and veggies. Fill it as high as possible. So many possibilities. They give you a small cup for your sauce that you pick out too. Then it's off to the grill and since I got a medium bowl you get two choices of your carbs. Noodles, rice, and even tortillas. I just basically got brown rice. Anyways, when it's done they bring your bowl to your table.

We liked that there was quite a variety of meats, vegetables, and toppings that you could use. One quibble that we both had is that it is extremely difficult to reach the sauces in the back row. However both of our meals were quite delicious and cooked to perfection.

She was doing everything from taking orders & payment, food prep, cooking, and waiting. However, the food made the wait absolutely worth it. It took about 40 minutes to be served, but the mackerel kimchi stew, fried mandu (dumplings) and kimchi & pork fried rice were all so delicious. There was a generous portion of mackerel in the stew, the mandu was perfectly crispy, and the fried rice was really yummy and a huge portion. It's honestly better than the Korean food I've had in KTown LA, KTown NYC and Annandale, VA. I was so surprised with it being the middle of nowhere PA.

For my meal I mistakenly ordered just the pork fried rice.  I misunderstood the menu - it normally comes with beef, chicken, and pork but I thought I had to choose.  No matter...it was still excellent.  My wife got the Dak Bo Kum which is essentially chicken with veggies and a side of rice.  It also had a very unique flavor to it that we both loved.

A unique item on the menu that comes highly recommended would also be the Korean Pancake with Kimchi.

On the way home from my meeting, I thought why not stop by The Golden Pig for lunch?  I am so glad I stopped by!

This 10 seat restaurant is presided by the most colorful Korean lady.  I didn't catch her name but wow, was she entertaining!

I got there at 1pm and it was still pretty packed.  And as I was finishing up, there was another couple and a family of 5 trying to get in for a late lunch.

I wanted to order just about everything on the menu.  It's a short menu, but all my Korean favorites.  I finally settled on the Daiji Bulgogi ($7.50) - Thin-sliced marinated pork in a spicy red pepper glaze.  Absolutely delicious and it came with a great assortment of banchan (Korean side dishes - seaweed and chives and kimchi).  The Daiji Bulgogi was just perfectly spicy.  The last time I had this was in Seoul last summer and it totally brought me back there in my first bite.

My bill came to $9.00 pre-tip and I ordered a Diet Coke.  I will have to make the trip to Cecil more often when I get my Korean food craving - which seems to be more often than not these days!  

Why not take the trip off the beaten path and give this place a shot?  I would never have guessed finding exceptional Korean food in a sleepy little town like Cecil.  It was like being back in Seoul - an incredible feat for a one woman show serving the dining room and cooking up classic soul satisfying Korean food at the same time!","['gimbap', 'pajeon', 'kimchibokkeumbap', 'bulgogi', 'japchae', 'kimchijeon', 'mandu', 'ramyeon', 'doenjangjjigaegyeranfry', 'tteokbokki']",1

Doug found it, actually, while looking through Yelp reviews, so we both owe a big thanks to the other Yelpers out there for your guidance.

The first thing I noticed about this place was how clean it is...absolutely spotless, which warms the heart of an ex-restaurant worker such as myself. There are two tables which both seat 3, and four seats along the bar. It was quiet when we arrived, and that was nice, as it gave us an opportunity to chat with the woman who was waiting tables and helping out in the kitchen. She was helpful and friendly, as was Yong Kwon, the owner, who works wonders in that tiny kitchen of hers. We started with the Korean pancake, which we ordered with potato...she asked if we wanted more veggies, and we said yes. This pancake was delicious...crispy and a little brown on the outside and creamy within, with plenty of vegetables inside. This pancake comes with the cole slaw and pickles, kim chee and sweet potatoes that had been marinated in soy, garlic and maple syrup then roasted in the oven. Everything was perfect; I especially appreciate that the sides came to the table room temperature and not straight from the fridge. Things taste so much better when they're the right temp, and the chef knows this. We went for the Daiji Bulgogi, marinated sliced pork that's served in a rich chile sauce that's slightly sweetened and garlicky, and the Buldak, a chicken dish that featured chicken thigh pieces in a very spicy chile sauce. Both dishes were spicy, with the pork dish having a greater variety of flavorings in it that balanced nicely between sweet, spicy and garlicky. The chicken dish was more a one note sauce, and tasted pretty much of straight chiles. I've had sauces like this in Mexico...dried red chiles pureed and mixed with very little else... and I love them. Both dishes were superb. I'll warn you here...you had better like spicy food if you're going to eat here. I understand some dishes here pack less heat than others, and I'm sure I'll discover which ones as I make my way through this menu. Yong runs the kitchen alone, so call ahead if you're in a hurry. My future plans are to go when it's slow and have a leisurely time of it, as we did last night. Yong is very friendly and obviously enjoys her customers, so you really do feel like you're in her home.

The food was quite delicious. My husband and I ordered the Korean pancake with kim chi, spicy pork bulgogi, and the japchae. All amazing.

She's the hostess, waitress, chef, and owner. She puts on the show right in front of you, and often throws a joke here and there for entertainment. This is the most authentic Korean restaurant in Pittsburgh, thank goodness I found this place, or my Korean food cravings would never be put to rest. The food is fresh and extremely flavorful. I highly recommend the kimchi or vegeatable pancake, add some of their hot sauce, and you have heaven in your mouth.  Their Jap Chae is perfectly made, very flavorful. I love food with a lot of flavor, on the salty side, so if you like the lightly flavored foods, you may need to ask the chef to tone down on the salt/soysauce. 

Portions are good, price is fairly cheap for Korean food in Pittsburgh.

Warning: Place is tiny. There're only 3 small tables and a mini bar inside so come early (before 6:30pm) if you want seats. There's a table outside that's good for 5 or 6. But let's face it, with Pittsburgh weather, you really can only dine at the table during summer. It's too cold to eat outside in the winter, fall, and even spring. This place is not good for parties of 4 or more. I recommend you order to go.","['gimbap', 'pajeon', 'kimchibokkeumbap', 'bulgogi', 'japchae', 'kimchijeon', 'mandu', 'ramyeon', 'doenjangjjigaegyeranfry', 'tteokbokki']",1

It would simply be unfair to judge a one-woman's home cooking operation to other large businesses in established Asian communities.  Simply put, she does a decent job in putting out a homey feel with food at reasonable prices.

Their condensed version of ban chan (small side items that accompanies the entree) come combined on one plate.  The handmade kimchi was outstanding and she also packages them in jars for sale.   

Some of the items on the menu I had:

Korean pancake - the texture is consistent with what I expect and the optional hot peppers really add a delayed heat kick that I enjoyed.

Bulgogi- a stir fry of seasoned meat and veggies that comes with steamed rice.  Simple but hits the spot.

Short Rib - comes already deboned and tender.  The marinade on the soft, tender meat is a welcome change.  I would have liked it even more with grilled onions.  

Mackerel tofu soup - large chunks of fish and spicy tofu soup.  The spines of the fish were super soft and can be eaten so no bones to worry about.  

Verdict: best Korean outside the city on the south side of town.","['gimbap', 'pajeon', 'kimchibokkeumbap', 'bulgogi', 'japchae', 'kimchijeon', 'mandu', 'ramyeon', 'doenjangjjigaegyeranfry', 'tteokbokki']",1

First: the food. I got Mandu which is classic Korean dumplings served with rice. Mine had broccoli, carrot, cabbage & tofu in them. There were way too many to ever eat in one sitting. Especially because we started with Kimchi Pancakes and a little kimchi veggie salad. 

Next: the environment. Golden Pig gets a lot of regulars. People kept coming into the store and going behind the counter to grab something to snack on or talk to the owner. Just as I was leaving a big rowdy group of guys came in and basically filled the restaurant. They started to pass around wine to all of us in the restaurant.

276,jXX-G_goCYZZrLSDY8qXdg,Golden Pig,4.0,,"It's really a one-woman show. She is such a sweetie and doesn't take a moment to pause in the kitchen, working away trying to serve everyone as fast as possible while still being friendly to all her guests an apologizing for the wait. Everything is fresh to order. EVERYTHING. I saw her get fresh veggies out of her fridge and chop them fresh for order. The only thing in a box were presoftened chapchae noodles. Imagine your mom making dinner for your family five times in a row in an hour. She is really working miracles there.

That said, the wait got pretty long while we were there, and that's with some of her regulars helping her after they finished eating. Really gives you that mom's kitchen feel. Made me smile.

Judging on the food itself alone, I don't think she's necessarily much better Asian-mom cook than many ordinary moms out there. In that respect it's not very impressive. In comparison, I have had better Mom&Pop shop Korean food in a similar type restaurant (though unfortunately located far away in Houston).

We had mandoo, daeji bulgolgi, chapchae noodles, korean pancakes. Everything tasted good and well-cooked but very ordinarily homey, and while I appreciate this and think it's the definite selling point of this adorable little shop, my parents were not impressed by the flavor and mom thought it's nothing she can't make herself... and she's probably right. 

Personally, I don't feel the need to come back as long as my mom is willing to feed me. But I recommend this as an awesome Asian-mom substitute for those in need of some delicious home-made comfort food. Everything about Golden Pig is just a home-with-your-mom experience. If I had something like this near me, I'd definitely be the top regular. But I know there are students in the 'Burgh away from their moms who would loooove a place like this to get a taste of home - too bad it's located so far away from the city :(","['gimbap', 'pajeon', 'kimchibokkeumbap', 'bulgogi', 'japchae', 'kimchijeon', 'mandu', 'ramyeon', 'doenjangjjigaegyeranfry', 'tteokbokki']",1

The pancake was a great - crispy with lots of veggies. The beef in the fried rice & bulgogi had amazing flavor and the japchae was also super tasty and looked beautiful. 

They also had a giant pineapple cake that appeared to have been just baked and were offering it to all of the customers.

The owner was very warm & welcoming and we were seated at one of 2 tables in the restaurant. There were also 2 other patrons seated at the bar that had 4 stools. It's a tiny operation. We ordered the Korean Pancake with Kimchi to start. My husband ordered the bul dak chicken that was described as fiery hot. I ordered the pork daeji bulgogi. 

Our Korean Pancake arrived with 2 starter plates with some amazing Korean Coleslaw, Kimchi & other assorted veggies. I mixed all the starter goodies with my kimchi pancake & it worked. Without these enhancements the pancake wasn't nearly as exciting. 

Both of our main dishes arrived with what appeared to be a similar sauce - the color of hot cheetos (that's literally off the Post Gazette review that hung above our table & he nailed it!). The sauces were nearly identical & I actually preferred it over my husband's chicken than my pork. Spice on a  1-10 scale was probably a 7 for the chicken & a 5 on the pork. That was about the only difference in the sauces that I could discern. It was definitely a home cooked style & pretty good.

If I lived close enough to frequent Golden Pig, I believe the owner's charming personality could woo me into a 4 star. She's quite fun and really brings her personality into her cooking. Realistically it's a 3.5 rating. Although I 100% get the plethora of 5 star ratings she's getting from regulars who adore her.

Of course I'm comparing the 2 directly and this place was good but not nearly as good as Chongs. I ordered the exact same meal that I normally would: Bulgogi (marinated beef), veggie pancake & Bimbap (seaweed roll). 
The layers of flavors are good and if you've never had Korean food you really should change that.  The thing I missed here were the dipping sauces and different textures between fresh and cooked veggies served along with the Bulgogi that I'm used to. 
They clearly use the same seasonings but different cooking methods, the bulgogi seemed soft & soupy, as if it's prepared in a slow cooker. Flavor was good, just a really tender texture that I didn't expect. 
Golden Pig is a bit pricey in comparison at $54 for lunch where I'd normally pay $28 for the same order at my local joint.  I don't think I'll return, however you should at least try it.

She has about one person serving and it is advisable to call in advance. She cooks everything while you wait so expect to be there for a while. It is a great experience. The food is Korean and mildly spicy. We had some kind of pancake with Kimchi with a dry korean coleslaw as she cooked our entrees. She also served us green tea. I had some kind of teriyaki tofu with veges that was pretty good and my boyfriend had the kimchi shigae. It came in a huge hot pot and he loved. The rice was the most amazing she calls it special rice and IT IS special.

Next, I had the Sae Woo Bo Kum (saut챕ed shrimp). This was my favorite dish and main entree. The flavors were so powerful and enjoyable. The ingredients were all fresh and cooked to perfection!

Finally, I also ordered the spicy ramen! It was full of flavor and the broth was amazing for my head cold. I did not finish the noodles but I did finish all the broth.

331,H7pj7sbXY3N-WSEwa-JfpA,Golden Pig,4.0,,"I kept hearing about the hype about how this was the most authentic and best Korean food in the area (some claim in southwestern PA??) and finally decided to make the drive out here from the city. Unfortunately, this dining experience probably gave me the largest ever deviation between expectation and result.

I'll cut straight to it--the food is not my type. Eat at an acclaimed Korean restaurant on the coasts, or if you're in the suburbs just make the reverse drive that I did into the city and go to a place like Korea Garden or Nak Won Garden. They're not mind-blowing, but I assure you they're much closer to what you'll find in NY or LA than Golden Pig is. We got the ramen to start--okay, we weren't expecting instant ramen, but fine it was $5 and somewhat hearty. As we waited for entrees, we never got our banchan, and no one came by to check on us or at least give us some water (for the record, other customers got the side dishes at the beginning, without asking). 

When the entrees came, we asked the guy (not the couple who owns the place) and he was somewhat apologetic for forgetting. The banchan consisted of a small plate with two pieces of random things like kimchi, potato, and broccoli (??). It wasn't amazing, but the biggest surprise was that each of us got one such plate. Go to any other authentic Korean place, and a table would get one portion of each side separately. Yes, it's the same food in the end, but the implication is entirely different--these sides are meant to be shared among the people dining together, and preparing them on separate plates individualized for each person signifies a huge shift in the dining experience. I understand that they might be trying to accommodate for customers who don't regularly eat this kind of food. At a certain level, both patron and restaurant have to adapt to different customs (and that's a good thing for intercultural mixing), but I felt that the owners went too far in this instance.

For the entrees, we got the daeji bulgogi and buldak, both of which were rather mediocre. They weren't terrible, but I've had better at the aforementioned places in Pittsburgh. The two main issues were that 1) there was too much sauce on both plates, and 2) there were few other seasonings or flavors. For 1), it appears from the Yelp pics for this place that they're not very consistent--some appear drenched in sauce, while others actually look appetizing. We got the former, and that probably led to 2); the only taste was spicy, and while there were some onion and carrot pieces their taste was basically overwhelmed by the sauce. Other than that, the sesame was probably a bit overdone, and some scallion would probably have helped a lot.

Despite all this though, I'm genuinely happy that this couple has made it this far. It's not always easy working such long hours as an immigrant family, but evidently they're making a lot of people happy. They've also put in a lot of work making the restaurant welcome to everyone (try to count how many pigs are inside if you go), so I hope they thrive as long as there are happy customers.","['gimbap', 'pajeon', 'kimchibokkeumbap', 'bulgogi', 'japchae', 'kimchijeon', 'mandu', 'ramyeon', 'doenjangjjigaegyeranfry', 'tteokbokki']",1

You'll also find that a lot of people put in to-go or pick up orders, so even if there aren't many other people dining in, your food could still take a little longer than expected. However, our food still got out to us pretty fast! No complaints. The meal also starts off with a small plate of kimchi, pickled radish, broccoli with some type of sauce, and Korean coleslaw so you can snack on it if your food takes a bit of time! They were all so yummy- I ate half while waiting for my food and half with the appetizers and my entree.

For food we ordered the Fried Potatoes, Egg Soup, and the Korean Pancake with Veggies and Hot Pepper as appetizers. The Potatoes were nothing to shake a stick at. The egg soup was good, but it was better when we added the hot sauce to it. The best part of the soup were the giant chunks of egg in it! The pancake was incredible- would definitely get again, maybe next time with kimchi. 

For our entrees, I got the Saut챕ed Tofu and Veggies. It wasn't overly flavorful, but I did really love how they prepared the tofu (pan fried as opposed to fried in a fryer like most places). It was pretty garlicky which I really liked, and the veggies were bright and perfectly cooked. My mom and sister got the Saut챕ed Shrimp and neither one of them was crazy about it- overall not super flavorful. They preferred mine. My dad got the Kalbi, and while it wasn't what he expected, he thought it was excellent. We also shared a Veggie Fried Rice, which was good but not as amazing as the people in the restaurant told us as they were leaving. It was good paired with our entrees, but I don't think I would've enjoyed it alone.

Overall this restaurant was great! Definitely an experience and some of the best (and maybe only) Korean food you'll find in the area.","['gimbap', 'pajeon', 'kimchibokkeumbap', 'bulgogi', 'japchae', 'kimchijeon', 'mandu', 'ramyeon', 'doenjangjjigaegyeranfry', 'tteokbokki']",1

Who would think the best Korean place in Pittsburgh would be way out in Cecil?  This might be the teeniest place ever but wow is it big on taste! 

We went at 2pm on a Monday so even though it was tiny (only seats about 11 people total) and I'm sure it gets packed, there were only 2 other (very friendly) people in there that were finishing up and leaving.  It seems like they have a lot of regulars.  The owners (?) behind the counter taking our order and cooking were very nice.

Down low on the food:  the Korean pancake was ginormous and so good.  We got the vegetable but added some hot pepper too and then mixed the 2 sauces (chili paste&something else) at the table to dip it in and it added just the right amount of heat and extra flavor.  Also ordered the bulgogi and for some reason on the hottest day of the year my sister wanted the spicy mackerel tofu soup. He warned us when ordering it was fishy (which we expected and it was) but it also was chock full of other goodies like tofu and kimchi and super flavorful.  The banchan they serve with your order was awesome!

This place is so small that it is uncomfortable. Seriously. I have never dined in a public place this tiny and dirty. I assume that because this business is shoehorned in a cinder block bunker there is no place to store cleaning agents but in full sight of customers. I was literally rubbing elbows with some stranger and neither one us was happy about it... Second, don't bother asking for water unless you want to pay for bottled. I needed to take a prescription pill and was lectured about how they don't have glasses for water. Seriously? I stood my ground and was brought room temperature tap water in a styrofoam cup. Nice. Onto the food. I had the kimchi pancakes. They were what one would expect. I then ordered gimbop. It was average. We also shared a vegetable fried rice. It
 was average. I asked for hot sauce and the owner flipped out on me. Informed me that hot sauce will ruin the dish...thanks for the lecture, but I like my food spicy and I'm paying for it...so...give me hot sauce sans lecture. To drive 40 minutes from the city to get jammed into this ugly space to eat average Korean is not my idea of a culinary experience. I suppose if my car breaks down in Cecil I might be back to the Golden Pig. Otherwise, there are better options.","['gimbap', 'pajeon', 'kimchibokkeumbap', 'bulgogi', 'japchae', 'kimchijeon', 'mandu', 'ramyeon', 'doenjangjjigaegyeranfry', 'tteokbokki']",0

After reading all the hype about this place I was really eager to try it out. It's a little restaurant with about 10 tables. 

We were greeted with tea, seaweed, green beans and kimchi. For the main course, being a huge bibimbap fan, I ordered the beef bibimbap along with the beef Cupbap. Bibimbap is a very popular Korean dish served with rice, vegetables and an egg in a hot stone bowl. The beef Cupbap was served with sweet potato noodles & rice and heavily dressed with a sauce. Of the two, the bibimbap was definitely a better choice. Both dishes can have more meat especially the Cupbap which hardly had any meat.

The resto is small seats about 24 at full capacity. The walls are decorated with asian fans and pics of food.  We got a table at the front window and ordered on their scroll menus. Btw, it's a cash and debit place.  We ordered the seafood pancake, a bulgogi beef cup bap and a soup and noodle with beef.  

The seafood pancake had shredded sweet potato, lots of onions, some zucchini and a little hint of chili peppers. It's very light in texture. The taste was great as a veggie pancake but there were only microscopic amounts of seafood. I found a tiny shrimp and a shred of squid. I would've liked more seafood. The bulgogi cup bap was good, reminds me of the vegetarian rice bowls with dressing but with meat.  One thing I noticed was that they don't use Korean styled rice completely. It looks like the rice is a blend of the short grain rice with long grain white.  This changes the flavor a bit. I prefer my short grain rice straight :)  The banchan was delicately flavored with shredded daikon, kimchi and seaweed sheets.  The daikon was really good so I got seconds.

Perhaps it is because people have their heads down or looking straight ahead, trying to get from point a to point b. Sadly, this means that some really quality spots get totally overlooked, and I would have to say Jumak is one of those places. 

This place has been around for roughly 8 months, and it's only really because of Yelp (haaaaay!) that Jumak fell on my radar. And finally, my partner and I had a little free time during lunch (and some errands to run nearby) and decided to give it a try. 

Now I grew up in Koreatown Los Angeles, arguably the most Korean city in North America. So I have moderate expectations. And I have been let down. Thankfully, Jumak did not disappoint. 

The restaurant is a cleanly, simply decorated place that seats about 20 people or so. The server was super nice and helpful. And the food was SOLID. We ordered the seafood soon du bu and bulgogi bibimbap. The soon du bu was perfectly spicy with a nice seafood-y twang. The bibimbap was clean, had a great portion of meat (sometimes places only have a little bit of meat). Both we delicious and hot devoured.

So much things to choose from and it doesn't come in big quantity so you can taste a lot of things without being to full.

Points forts : La quantit챕, la quantit챕, la quantit챕. La c척te de b흹uf marin챕e est excellente. Le concept est relativement unique que l'on ne voit jamais ailleurs dans les restos canadiens.

It is mainly a place to socialize with a group of friends. It gets noisy at times but it's about what you would expect at a BBQ. Also, the restaurant is usually rather full and the waiters might take a while to notice you. The food itself is nothing to rave about, but they offer a nice selection of a bit of everything. For meat lovers, the short ribs and white fish are particularly delicious. The food can burn quickly so it is especially important to change the grill every so often when it starts to stick.

GOOD:
the menu selection is so big!
I love the cook-your-own-meat. 
the sushi isn't bad for an all-you-can-eat

BAD:
the service - they sometimes forget things you ordered, and sometimes ignore your table
the price - $25 AND a charge if you don't finish things 
the portions are pretty small, but I guess you can order more
there's no special treatment, the service will put down your dishes anywhere on the table (so you have to put them in front of whoever ordered them) and walk away immediately

Also, it happened quite a few times that not all the items we ordered came out. The second reason is the most important I believe. Me and my friends asked for chocolate ice cream.

On top of the meats they offer to BBQ yourself, there is also a good selection of delicious sushi, grill-able vegetables and Korean appetizers to choose from.

Turns out Seoul Chako has grills embedded in tables so you are the grill master! 

Sadly that was where the fun ended for us. The vibe is odd: they obviously want to be this cool lounge, but it's essentially a buffet, so expect a loud, continuous flow of employees bussing dirty plates everywhere. The selection is good, but you'll be lucky if you end up with what you ordered! Our pork became pork belly, we got less veggies than advertised on the menu, if we got them at all, and the pineapple order will get you one (1) slice. That's it! Our waitress was super efficient otherwise, so efficient that around 10:00pm she ducked down below our table to turn off our grill.. 15 minutes later she explained the kitchen would be closing.

417,pjyiGFo8GNQ4YvcukxbOug,Seoul Chako,1.0,,"Mmmmm Korean BBQ:) I first discovered it while living in  LA and I took to it instantly!

Ahh the aroma of chargrilled meat, tender, marinated, smoky perfection dipped in spicy, tasty sauces, definitely one of my favorites:)

I fiound Seoul Chako by chance and what a discovery it was!

I was on my way to Grummun 78 to pick up a few tacos and was lucky enough to find parking a block away. As I got out of my car, the heavenly smell of charcoaled meat grabbed my attention, I looked around to see where it was coming from and right infront of my car was Seoul Chako.

They had a little terasse outside which was packed with people grilling their meat so I decided to check out the menu at the front door which mentioned an all you can eat lunch time buffet.

I'm not really a buffet girl, although I love food, I don't eat a ton but the smell and my memories of korean BBQ made me go in.

The host told me that the lunch time buffet ended at 3pm, it was now 2:30, so he said that I would only be able to order once.

I sat down at a table, my centre piece grill was lit and he gave me my little form to fill out my choices

For 13.99$ you get your pick of a variety of cuts of beef, chicken and shrimp is also on the menu.

A few salads, sushi and green tea of mango ice cream for desert.

I have always had eyes bigger then my mouth and suddenly I felt starved. I asked my waiter how much meat was on a plate and he said 4 pieces, which didn;t sound like much. 

I ordered 2 plates of meat, a plate of chicken, 2 bowls of rice, a California roll, a salad and a vegetable plate. 

I paid my bill in advance, I am not  really a patient type of girl, once I'm done eating, I like to run.

I then started reading through the menu again and saw a note at the bottom saying, do not waste food, you will be charged a 1$ for each wasted piece,

hmmmmmm....maybe I was a little greedy and piggish and ordered a little too much? 

Within a few minutes my waiter is back with a scary amount of food!


4 plates of meat, yes 4, not the 2 I ordered, a plate of chicken, 2 rice bowls, sushi and salad and me in a booth....

I started slinking down in my seat, feeling very piggish, how the hell am I going to eat all this??

That thought was quickly cast aside and I started digging

 into my meal....

I arranged some meat, onions and mushrooms on my grill and started on my little salad..

A pretty simple one but fresh, crisp chunks of lettuce with a tasty dressing, nothing special but still good.

The sushi was your typical California roll, I had one piece then pushed it aside,

Back to my meat....In a nuthshell, melt in your mouth goodness, rich, well marinated with just the right amount of marbling to make it delicious!

After finishing one plate of meat and rice, I started feeling nervous, I cannot eat all this and I cannot just leave it all on the table!

There was a group of guys behind me eating, who just asked the waiter for more meat but it was past 3, so no meat for you:)

I popped my head over and asked them, do you guys want my meat? They gave me a weird look but said yes.

My table was still overloaded and I was stuffed, so I cooked the rest and decided to bring it home to my shih tzu.


My stomach was full but I was in the mood for something sweet, so I ordered the mango ice cream, to finish things off:)

It came within a few minutes,  a perfect little portion in a cute little square bowl,

Sweet, fruity, creamy goodness, great finish to all the meat.

All in all, a delicious treat, I will be back, this time with company:)","['galbigui', 'mandu', 'bulgogi']",1

419,KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Seoul Chako,3.0,,"Seoul Chako is one of these places I've been to many times, and liked less and less.
When I came to Montreal, I thought it was great, mainly because I never had Korean BBQ. 
It was a great place to grab dinner with friends, especially if they never really had Korean BBQ either. The food was on average acceptable, but not very authentic (the owners are Chinese). After a visit or two, I already knew to avoid certain meat cuts, and to stick to a few crowd favorites (and also that my clothes would smell of BBQ for days). 

One downside is the lack of vegetables. There's not much except mushrooms, bell pepper and zucchini. Another weakness is the service. They are usually understaffed, and it's difficult to get serviced sometimes. They also tend to bring incomplete orders or, at worst, to forget them altogether. As with other all you can eat places such as Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, it's safer to order everything you want to eat on the first order. Otherwise, I haven't had many bad experiences at Seoul Chako over the years, although I did find a dead ant in my mango jelly once (the staff promptly apologized and brought me a new one).

There are certainly more authentic and better quality Korean BBQ in town (e.g. Chez Hwang). But if you're looking for a loud, cheap-ish, straightforward place to eat a lot of meat, then I guess Seoul Chako is okay.","['galbigui', 'mandu', 'bulgogi']",0

I didn't like any of the sushi specialties,  just the regular cucumber and avocado makis which were nice and refreshing. 

The second time i went, we felt everything was tasteless, and the avocado was a bit browned :(
My friend didn't like the saki, it was very vinagery. I haven't tried a saki I liked yet, so I wouldn't know.  And the side order of spicy mayo wasn't spicy at all, tasted like mayo with food coloring    :(

And the service was very poor in the begining at our 2nd time. I wasn't too happy about just arriving like 20 min before the lunch time they stated, and yet still get charged for dinner, which is the same thing but for 2x$. They should have written it at the right time. Also a waiter told us to pay right after we ordered our first round because he was ending his shift, so we had to split his tip with the next waiter, instead of paying a full tip each, which would have been double for us, my friend was upset about that. Near the end a really good worker began his shift, and he was taking our plates very fast, so my friend decided to give the tip to him.

As for the food, only some of the meats, like the beef and short ribs, are really worth your time and money as they taste the best.

434,Fqe0t4Yg6QJ_p44_wsmPzg,Seoul Chako,4.0,,"Having experienced Korean BBQ before in major US cities and a few times in Toronto. I was really looking forward to see what all-you-can-eat Seoul Chako had to offer my taste buds. 

Lets start by complimenting the trendy atmosphere they have created with an inviting dining area, music playing in the background and lights dimmed just right. Seating area is a mix of tables and booths and all designed with built-in natural gas BBQ grills where the main action takes place. The staff is well coordinated during busy hours, friendly and mostly english speaking. Now for the menu... 

Where most Korean restaurants would require a tour guide to walk you thru the complexity of their menu. This one is kept simple with a few choices of marinated and non marinated slices of meat, shellfish, a limited option on appetizers / side dishes (normally called Banchan) and only one soup option (two if you didn't know miso was Japanese). Everything is served with steamed rice, one spicy sauce (Ssamjang) and a lack of all the common condiments like fresh garlic you would find elsewhere. Also, the popular way of eating Korean BBQ is with lettuce wraps but unfortunately this will cost you an extra $1.50 per order. Sliced lamb is also available on the evening menu over the weekend. Sushi is also on the weekend menu but at this point I would stick with the Korean stuff. If not familiar with Korean BBQ you want to order ALL appetizers / side dishes and mostly stick with beef, short ribs and pork for a great meal.

Although an overall good experience the menu itself could use a little more authentic Korean options. They just recently open so there's room for improvement and get their liquor license issue straightened.

Great...
All-you-can-eat and do it yourself experience. 

No so great...
Lettuce and beverages are extra's. May rush you out on a busy Saturday night. Avoid tables near the front door or really close to a speaker if this is an intimate night out.","['galbigui', 'mandu', 'bulgogi']",0
435,K0FpfBo7N5EIog3Mlh2ZYg,Seoul Chako,4.0,,"Ahhh the disappointment! Anyone who knows Korean BBQ knows that the meat must be served with lettuce in order to make your wrap that consists of meat and rice. It's part of the dish. Seoul Chako likes to charge extra for lettuce! I can't believe it! That's like going to an Italian restaurant and ordering a plate of pasta but getting charged extra for the tomato sauce. I don't understand how they can serve a dish but charge you extra to enjoy it the way it's supposed to be eaten. The quality of the meat isn't the greatest either. The waiters are arrogant and the place in itself is pretty disorganized. I don't think I saw my waiter smile once the entire evening.

437,XK5NeMRDrwqSa9XQIWyskA,Seoul Chako,4.0,,"First off, i want to start by mentionning that i went here for lunch around 2pm ! Apparently its very different from dinner. Nonetheless i somewhat like it, here`s the gist : Fun & classy deco with comfortable dinner type/lounge benches - big wide tables & cool blueish/eclectic lighting .
 
How it works : you sit down, look at the menu & write down on a little note pad available to you on the table with pencils, the number of the item of foods you want & their quantity. Example : Lets say grilled beef is numer 15 on the menu, you write down 15 & next to it 1 or 2 depending on the portion you want !
You can choose a variety of meats, vegetables & entrees such as samosas , spring rolls & sushis . There is also desserts , i had some mango ice cream , it was great ! However i felt like their wasnt enough variety, your typical beef, pork or chicken , some vegetables & a select few entrees...but i was told it was for the lunch menu & that for dinner, it was much more complete with things like sea food & many other vegetables addded. 
All in all the food had great taste & it was fun to grill it yourself while chatting up with a friend, the meats cooked pretty quickly , and i like mine very well cooked not bloody at all.

So i'm defnitely curious to go back for Dinner. Oh also, i went there with a friend but i think it would be much more fun as a group ! 

Only down side was that i felt a little rushed by the waiters & they seemed pretty hyper & in a hurry. But i later found out that it was because the restaurant closes from 3 to 5 i think, to switch from lunch to dinner time. Still it made the experience less enjoyable","['galbigui', 'mandu', 'bulgogi']",0

Short ribs - Delicious, nicely seasoned, good size
Spicy sausage- A winner !!   LOL...
Fish fillet - nice and thick, lean pieces of meat, delicious
Chicken teriyaki - OK, not great
Short rib noodle - Too salty for my taste, not a return item for me
Fried scallops - crispy, delicious, nicely done
Spicy Escolar roll was OK, not the best sushi, but ok
Salmon Nigiri was again, OK, not the greatest
Short Rib fried rice was OK, I rather have the short rib meat and the steamed rice separate.
Mango ice cream, did not agree with my lactose intolerant stomach LOL..

Overall a nice buffet, if you find what you really like and keep eating it.   Prices are higher Friday - Saturday - Sunday.

- Food is terrible. Everything has a taste of burnt plastic. Probably the oil they use on the grill? Rests of soap? I can't even tell. The food itself is almost not seasoned so this plastic taste isn't even hidden by anything.

I've been to an AYCE Korean BBQ place.  I've been to an AYCE sushi place.  But I've never been to an AYCE Korean BBQ and Sushi place.  Unfortunately for me, I wasn't prepared to come otherwise I would've worn some looser fitting clothes.   We wanted to go to a place down the street but our group was too big for them to accommodate.  So we naturally followed the crowd and saw the line at Seoul Chako and decided to eat here instead.  Luckily for us, the place is big and was able to take our group after a short wait.

This place is perfect for a bunch of meat hungry guys.  Hmm, that did't sound right.  Nevertheless, you pick from menu with well over a dozen different kinds of meat and seafood.
Each order comes in a small bowl with a small portion for you to cook yourself on a grill that's built into your table.  There's no limit on the amount that you can order so as long you eat it all other wise you'll be charged extra.  All the meats I tried were good, tender, and well marinated.  Everything on the sushi menu, although limited, was good and above average for a buffet.  

My only gripe was our server.  He was slow with our drinks and food and some of requests were met with a eye roll.  Not sure if he hates his job or was just repulsed by the amount of food that us Americans were throwing down but he did not look like he wanted to be there.  

Regardless, this is one of MANY restaurants along St. Catherine but should be up among the places you should try especially if you're trying to accommodate a big group.","['galbigui', 'mandu', 'bulgogi']",0

470,k2qyzc1yQc6UppJLKDCHCg,Seoul Chako,4.0,,"Where to start! This is definitely a restaurant I have been to several times over the course of 2-3 years. And I can tell you that not once have I walked away from this restaurant feeling down or unsatisfied. 

The customer service is simple. Because it's the customers who are cooking the food (besides sushi and anything fried), it's not a surprise that the customer service isn't as individualized. The staff is expected to just bring the ingredients, fill your water glasses, and take away the empty plates. And what's great is that if you order too many plates, they will warn you of the consequences and see to it that you take only a third or half of those plates. Besides, it's not over if you finish everything and still want more. You're always welcome to send in a new order slip to them. Just leave it on the table and they'll come pick it up. If the metal grill, on which you cook the meat, seafood, and veggies, gets soiled, a waiter will come around to change it. And you don't even have to ask them to sometimes. Same with the refilling of water. I am aware that some reviewers have had problems with reservations, but when it comes to the actual service of food, there are few to no complaints. 

Now onto the exciting part: the meat. For carnivores like me, this is perhaps a restaurant that will have your heart's desires in mind. They serve very juicy and tender meat, that is, if you cook it well enough. They serve a large variety of meat, and you may be able to try all that they offer if you go at dinner time. My favourites are the spare ribs and ox tongue. The chewiness of the latter appeals to me. And spare ribs are very commonly used in Korean BBQ. The only meat I would refrain from is the chicken. It tends to come out very dry and nearly flavourless. Shame, for chicken is one type of food I crave most days. 

All the vegetables come out fresh and can be eaten uncooked, but I would highly recommend cooking the mushrooms at least. In fact, I love the mushrooms so much I order at least 3 plates of them. Anyway, at any restaurant offering Korean BBQ, mushrooms are a popular accompaniment. And of course, if you're not too keen on the veggies, there are soups and salads along with non-BBQ dishes, like dumplings and sushi, to choose from. Heck, they even have french fries and popcorn chicken. Yes, you heard me right. French fries. 

After all's been said and eaten, you can never go wrong with unlimited ice cream. As I always tell my friends when I go to an all-you-can-eat place, I have a second stomach for ice cream. In my most recent visit, I had 4 bowls of ice cream. Each bowl equals one scoop by the way, so I fortunately did not get brain freeze. 

Just be careful of what time you go at and how much they charge you. If you come near the end of the lunch period, you will have to pay the dinner fee, which is higher of course. But at least you'll be offered a larger variety of food. 
And sometimes if you come in large groups, your receipt may indicate a slightly different total price from the other receipts, even in the case when everyone has ordered the same things and nothing requiring extra charges.","['galbigui', 'mandu', 'bulgogi']",1

MANY of our orders were neglected and never came, so we had to reorder a second time only because we were missing most of our items. Price seemed fair considering it's an all-you-can-eat. 

My biggest issue was cleanliness. The table was not cleaned, or not very well at least. As we walked to our table we passed by the bar and lounge area that was a complete mess, with boxes and glass racks stacked against the wall everywhere, which is unexpected from this type of space and restaurant.

This place is almost too good to be true. The wait staff was amazingly friendly and quick. 
We had several orders of the beef and beef ribs. Both were absolutely delicious...and we loved cooking it ourselves. We prefer the beef ribs slightly charred like my boyfriends mom makes at home. 
We also had the pickled veggies and dumpling. I absolutely loved the pickled daikon, cucumbers and carrots. The dumplings were deep fried, and while they were quite good, I think I prefer pan fried dumplings (potstickers or gyoza). 
Also, the lychee martini was amazing, and if it hadn't been so hot out, I'd probably have had a few more. They were some of the cheapest cocktails around. (I think 5.75 cad or something).
The only hiccup was the internet was down so they couldn't take cards or print a bill, but they did have an ATM so we were able to grab cash out right on the spot.

Everything comes compartmentalized in cute black stackable bowls that are easy to pass around for everyone to dig in.

491,FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Seoul Chako,1.0,,"Went for my birthday, again lol

They opened recently, it's an all you can eat korean bbq place. The service is a bit dodgy so expect to wait a bit so don't go if you're in a rush.

When we were there they had some problems with the ventilation, so expect to smell when you leave.

The place looks nice, the tables all have a gas fire pit in the middle, so you can cook your food right at the table, it's closer to the way we see it in other major cities.

Montreal is a bit behind the trend concerning korean food, compared to TO, Vancouver and NYC...  but this place will bring us closer.

Like all Korean bbq places in mtl you get a few side dishes, always kim chi, bean sprouts, stewed potatoes and some sea weed, daicon pickles, fried tofu... that's about 6 sides which is more than usual, i think the average is about 3 usually in mtl, so on that point, that's good.

of the sides, the potatoes are quite good, the rest are just average. There are over 20 sides that I've come to know, so we are far behind. I once was served 14 sides in NYC, just the sides alone filled me up that time...

On to the food, you basically order by the type of meat you want. On this point there is quite a bit to choose from, you have chicken, lamb, beef, beef short rib, pork, shrimp (with head and peel), fish, squid, sausage, veggies. nb: bbq shrimp should be had with head and peel, the flavor is deeper and the shrimp stays moist once cooked. You should at least suck on the head if you don't want to eat it. I eat the whole thing from head to tail, and I like it, it's a bit of an acquired taste, but if you peel the shrimp it will taste quite unsatisfying since it will taste bland like boiled shrimp...

The meat comes in small portions, usually 2-3 pieces. Which is good since you can order a wide variety and reorder what you like after... We tried the beef, beef short rib, squid, shrimp, fish, sausage and some veggies. I strongly recommend the short rib!!! I was quite impressed with it, it was fresh and the cut is quite thick, I'd say about half an inch thick cooked. it was tender and juicy. very nice, i've never had it quite so thick but I like it. (update feb 2012, the thickness is less but still thicker than other places)

We didn't try any chicken or pork because my friend wasn't so keen on it, but i wish we had, I want to try it!!! you can also order rice with your order if you want.

The menu also offers, some starters like miso soup and salads and edamame, and a variety of sushi rolls.

The starters are nice, nothing impressive but they do enhance the experience. The sushi is standard also, however the fish is quite fresh. I'm really impressed with the freshness of the meats and fish in this place, considering it's 21.99 $ per person all you can eat!!! (23.99 friday to sunday)

My one problem is they don't bring out the dipping sauce with the meat, we had to ask them for it. When we got the sauce, it turned out to be gochuchang, which is Korean hot paste. Traditionally, they eat korean bbq with bean paste, this I find strange that they offer gochuchang, but in any case I always eat my bbq with gochuchang so I'm not complaining :)

Also usually proper Korean bbq is accompanied with raw garlic and sliced jalapenos and scallions for you to grill, all 3 are absent here, sadly I didn't bother to ask so no idea if they even have it on demand... Another standard item missing here is lettuce, peculiarly enough, lettuce is available to order for an additional 1.50$ what the? really, you are gonna milk me for lettuce?

The traditional way to eat korean bbq is to wrap it in the lettuce, inside you put the meat, garlic, scallions and whatever other sides you wish to put in like pickled radish and kim chi. So on this point, no this is not a comprehensive Korean bbq service, but then again, none of the places in mtl are... but taste wise it is good, and I like it. 

as a side note, I really wish we get a real Korean bbq joint where they use wood charcoal in the pit instead of gas. You get much better heat distribution and a nicer char on the meat, plus the bbq flavor really comes out. so if you happen to find a place like that anywhere you should try it :)

we ended with some ice cream, nothing special but nice to have something to cleanse your palate with, it's not persimmon tea but hey let's not ask for too much at once...
So on the strength of the meat quality, the price/quality ratio, side dish variety and advancing the Korean bbq scene in mtl, I give it 4 stars (compared to other mtl bbq places) even though my korean friends would curse me lol. I will definitely go back.","['galbigui', 'mandu', 'bulgogi']",1

The concept is great, really. Cooking your own food makes it fun and cuts costs for the restaurant, allowing the prices to be cheaper (in theory). However you would expect the quality of the food you are being served to be far better than what you actually get here. Korean BBQ is wayyyyy better than this. This place was hyped up to me by a couple of friends (whose opinions I will take very lightly in the future). Unfortunately, everything is too salty and lacking actual taste and flavor.

The sushi, likewise, was a major disappointment as well. I did not expect great sushi (it is a Korean restaurant after all) but it was far beyond sub-par. The makis were rolled very loosely, so everything would break about before you could stick the piece in your mouth. The only semi-acceptable roll were the plain avocado... but even then, the avocado tasted old and the seaweed had an odd flavor. Was it stale? We may never know.

The vegetables were probably the best part of the meal. You are better off going to Le Petit Tobeki (formerly known as 5000 ans) on Monkland... but even that has declined in quality.

We came here for dinner a few weeks ago for AYCE Korean BBQ. We got here around 8pm and waited about 15 minutes for a table. The place was pretty busy and there were many groups of people dining. 

We ordered the following:
1) Appetizers: Miso soup, green salad, and kimchi. I recommend all of these appetizers. The serving size is small. We ordered kimchi three times since it was pretty good.
2) Meats: Sliced beef and short ribs. I preferred the sliced beef over the short ribs. Overall, both meats were good.
3) Seafood: Clams, fish fillet, and salmon. The fishes were a bit hard to cook since it would get stuck to the grill. I really like the clams and there are four small clams per order.
4) Vegetables: Onions and oyster mushrooms
5) A bowl of rice for each of us

We didn't order the ramen, fried rice, or sushi rolls since these items would probably make us full quicker. We mainly focused on getting the meat and seafood. We thought the food was pretty decent for the price ($24.99 CAD for Wednesday night, about ~$20 USD per person).

Service was a bit spotty for us. They missed some of appetizer orders in the beginning. It took awhile for the staff to clear out the empty plates from our table.

517,XblC-uuSuABr-woFwtHPmg,Seoul Chako,3.0,,"J'adore les BBQ cor챕ens et depuis quelques temps, j'aper챌ois pleins de petits bouis-bouis qui fleurissent au centre-ville. Tant mieux, voil횪 une belle addition culinaire dans le circuit gourmand montr챕alais.

J'ai essay챕 ce buffet un mercredi midi, avec des amis. Le resto est assez r챕cent. L'ambiance 챕tait calme, peu de clients (il faut dire qu'il a fait 26 degr챕s 횪 l'ext챕rieur...), donc on pouvait bavarder en paix. La d챕coration est sobre. 

Le buffet est un prix fixe (la semaine le midi, c'챕tait 13,99 $ moins 10% de rabais du lundi au jeudi). Il y a un menu et on commande ce que l'on veut manger 횪 la serveuse. 

Le service 챕tait un peu mal organis챕 au d챕but, ce n'챕tait pas clair 횪 qui il fallait commander, car plusieurs employ챕s arrivaient avec les diff챕rents plats. Bon, pour nous, ce n'챕tait pas tr챔s grave, car on avait le temps. Mais je conseille de vous armer d'un peu de patience et de temps disponible si vous mangez l횪!


Petit b챕mol: primo, la laitue iceberg est 1,50$ en extra (pourquoi???) et les boissons (y compris le th챕 vert) ne sont pas incluses dans le prix du buffet. Secondo, il n'y a pas de shoju, un alcool pourtant typiquement cor챕en (????)

Petit plus: le prix qui est doux pour le porte-feuille et le fait que c'est un buffet 횪 volont챕. Parfait pour vos carnivores affam챕s pr챕f챕r챕s!

Est-ce que j'y retournerai? Probablement pas, car il y a tellement de restos dans ce coin-l횪 et que j'aimerais essayer. J'ai mang챕 dans de meilleurs restos cor챕ens ailleurs.","['galbigui', 'mandu', 'bulgogi']",0

520,KSv5EPhZr5s_5jjva7o-qw,Seoul Chako,3.0,,"I went to Seoul Chako yesterday with my girlfriend during lunch hour. Normally 13.99, we had student discounts that reduced the price to 10 dollars. 

There were very few people in the restaurant while we were there, I'd say 3-4 other patrons at the most (keep in mind this is a hot Thursday noon).  

AMBIANCE:
Top-notch. This is a very new restaurant, and the interior design and amnesties show that. Each table has their own grill, and it's a very high-tech one at that. They have their own inbuilt ventilation system that takes away the messiness and teary eyes usually associated with grilling your own food. 

SERVICE:
Quick and professional, though i wasn't particularly used to the way we ordered the food. Unlike similar asian buffet restaurants such as Tokyo/Kanda/Crescent sushi,  you don't write your order down on a piece of paper; instead the waiter comes around every so often to take your order. As a result we had to order food 3 times, a needless stress really. 

FOOD:
Here is where Seoul Chako falls a bit short. In one word, food is SALTY. Everything from the meat, to the soups, to the sushi. I had to down 2 glasses of water during the meal. Beef is definitely the highlight on the menu, it is tender and tasty. Short ribs were hard to cook, and overly fatty. The chicken and octopus were way too salty for my liking. 

Sushi is also served here, though they aren't as good as Tokyo Sushi across the street. 

All in all, I would highly recommend this to any students who can get their hands on coupons (and man are they plentiful). Worth it for 10 bucks, not sure whether or not the normal priced lunch/dinner would be as good as a deal.","['galbigui', 'mandu', 'bulgogi']",0

It's an all-you-can-eat BBQ

You cook your own food

You can pick between a bunch of different meats and seafood

But, it doesn't stop there!

There's sushi....there are salads....there's edemame....there are raw veggies.....there are fries....and there's ice cream! How can you go wrong?!

The waiters are always happy

The food is super duper fresh

And did I mention that it's an all-you-can-eat BBQ????

In all seriousness though, the food really is quite good here.. Well marinated and well cut. The only thing I'm really not a fan of here is the chicken.. But that's just because of the marinade. Other than that, my mouth is totally watering and I wish it wasn't close to midnight so I could run over there and devour everything on that menu right now!

1. My friend found a piece of plastic in her soup. She told our server about it, the server showed that soup to the manager. We didn't receive any apology or explanation from the manager. Then the server scooped another bowl of soup from the same pot instead of making her a new one.

2. We receive a plate of sushi with the order ticket on top of it. Then our server put his hand on our food to take away the order ticket.

3. We brought bubble tea to the place. They told us that we are not allowed to take our drink with us and took it away. But when we finished our dish and ask for our tea, he told us that someone closed the fridge door too hard so our tea was spilled. We didn't even have a chance to take a sip before he took it away. He apologized, pulled out his wallet and gave us cash for the tea. But my point here is not about the money. We would like to drink our tea instead of getting the reimbursement.

A restaurant that can not keep their food clean, cannot keep the customers stuff, does not deserve five stars. 

I give one star because the food is average and there is only one server that was patient and nice when I explained to him that I'm not a cheap tipper in general. The reason that I only gave 10% tip is that the service and the cleaning standard need to be improved. 

I've been to almost all if the restaurant in Montreal but this one is the worst. Don't waste your 40$ with tax and tips included in this place. Go to Miso or park to have some proper barbecue or sushi.","['galbigui', 'mandu', 'bulgogi']",0

After 10 minutes we were served a single bowl of edamame, allthewhile the table beside us recieved everything they ordered.
Another 20 minutes passed and we received bits of our order - a tray or two of meat here and there - but nothing close to our original order. We then flagged our server down and asked what was taking the food so long. He told us to reorder, which we though was weird, but we did anyway.

We were still waiting on things as simple as miso soup and rice after hitting the 45 minute mark. Then our server brought us a large lump of rice on a single plate for all five of us to share. Never have I ever been to a Korean BBQ restaurant where one plate of rice was given for multiple people to share instead of given individual bowls.

After over an hour of waiting, reordering, and still not getting all of our food we asked to speak to a manager. The manager came over and insisted he would get us our missing items within 30 seconds - this was not the case. We had to wait an additional five minutes to receive our miso soup, which contained NO tofu whatsoever!

After all of this inconvenience we finally received everything we ordered. Overall the food tasted great, but the service was absolutely horrible and I will not be returning.

To me the service wasn't the greatest. I understand that it can get pretty hectic when it is busy. But I've been to places that were just as busy or even busier. Our waiter did not even ask to see if this was our first time or to see if we knew how things worked. I've been to a Korean BBQ before but did not have to order by writing on a piece of paper. If I had not asked, we would have been sitting there for forever without anything. 
We both felt that the cleanliness wasn't the greatest. They could definitely improve on that. 
There was a lot of selections on the menu. Personally, the sushi was not good to me. Well the California roll was decent *shrugs*. The quality of meat was not the best to me. My bf thought the short rib was good, but I have had better. The pork belly was ok. I did like the spicy sausage and my bf liked the regular sausage.

Uses Bacon for Samgyupsarl

Marinated Meat does not taste anything Korean

No Lettuce for wrapping

No Samjang - Most important sauce for Korean BBQ

No Garlic or kimchi for side grilling. Instead they have some weird grilled Onion options which Koreans never do.

No dish, I mean '0' dishes in the menu thats Korean at all. Instead they have sushi options. 

They dont change the grill when it gets filthy with soot until you are finished. Average Korean bbq places would at least change it 2-3 times for one meal sitting. 

They even had the oddity of having their signage in Chinese but no Korean even if its a 'Korean' restaurant.

And the kimchi, well...I'm no kimchi expert, but it didn't taste very appetizing. It was not sour enough for my liking. Service was inconsistent. I was served by 6 or 7 different people. Dinner cost was overpriced. $21.99 for all you can eat. Plus was, meat seemed fresh, came in nice small portions. Service was also generally pleasant.

My sister made reservations at 5h45  she got there with her daughter and other sister 5 minutes before. But the manager wodnt let her ger seated unt at least there were 5 people and if no one came in 5 minutes they were gonna give the table to someone else.We were stuck in traffic and since no place to park, I dropped my mom, daughter and aunt and went looking for parking. After 20 minutes turning in circles I find a paying parking lot. I finally arrive and there is no room for me. I had to go get my own chair to sit because the manager gave one of our tables away. My brother had dropped his wife and kids and was looking for parking. I had been sitting for 15 minutes and no one had yet come and got me a plate or glass of water. 6 out of the 11 had already started eating. The tables are not proportionate whether it was a small or big  ne, there was only one bbq in the middle. Not practical.for those on the corners.Then the waitresses just came and shoved plates around in front of me not knowing who ordered them.  I tell one of them I just came and if they can get me a plate and menu. They don't say anything. Then the manager comes and  starts serving wine. I tell him what is this setting. How are we going to be able to eat properly? The tables are not proportionate. Not like the bbq on our bigger table is any bigger. He says yeah, it's true and keeps pourring the wine. 10 minutes later, still no plate or menu. I tell him will not be eating there so not to bill me and that their service is shit. He says ok and leaves. I couldnt beleive it. He didn't even apologize and offer any thing for the bad service. So I get up and leave. Since my daughter had already ordered and started eating,  she stayed with the resr of the family. I went back simply to pay for my daughter's bill and they had the audacity to add tips automatically. I refused to pay the tips. Then he says sorry but you know it's Saturday and it gets very hectic. I  tell him it is not my problem or responsibility. This restaurant had no respect for their clients and to top it all off it's too pricey for what you get.

After, we ordered some side dishes and specially we ordered Takoyaki 3 times but they brought us these dishes after we finished our dinner :) It's ridiculous lol
The waiter who served us in the last minute was rude when we reordered the Takoyaki. We ended up having 2 small pieces although we ordered 3 times so it supposed to be 6 pieces.

Sushi at a Korean place? Never a good sign. Turns out the owners are Chinese so don't come here expecting the real deal. 

That being said, we were a group of four on a Thursday evening. Can't believe how busy it was. There was already a line at 6:30pm. One family I saw (also a party of four) didn't get sat for at least an hour. Yikes. Reserve (only can on weekdays). They almost messed up our reservation (took my friend's name down completely wrong) but everything was good in the end. 

There's three different menu prices. It depends on the time that you come and if it's weekday vs. weekend. 

- Lunch: Monday to Thursday (11:30am to 3:00pm): $15.99 vs. Friday to Sunday (12:00pm to 3:00pm): $16.99
- Dinner: Monday to Thursday (3:00pm to 10:30pm): $24.99 vs. Friday to Sunday: $26.99
- Late dinner: Friday to Saturday (11:00pm to 2:30am): $14.99

We tried most of the things on the dinner menu except for the fillers (aka. rice, deep fried and sushi). 
- Good: seaweed salad, kimchi radish, tofu skin sushi, sliced beef, short rib, ox tongue, salmon, clams (its spelt calms on the menu), corn, pineapple (wish they sliced these flat instead of bite sized) and fried scallop. 
- Decent: kimchi, salmon sushi (this is nigiri: okay but rice is bland), spicy salmon roll, spicy sausage, onion, zucchini and mushroom. 
- Bad: edamame (dry), green beans (frozen and tasteless) and all the desserts (vanilla, mango, green tea and strawberry yoghurt ice cream were generic and pretty unsatisfactory). Also tried the lychee jello (tastes like those lychee suction cup candies) and mango pudding (good but too sweet). Desserts were disappointing. 

Food was decent but service was pretty brutal. It was painful trying to flag down our waiter to get him to change our BBQ. We'd flag down other waiters and they'd say no problem but no one would come back.

It wasn't busy at all (probably 2 other tables), which is to be expected for a newer restaurant. I got there around 6 PM. The server was very quick to greet and seat us, which is a big plus. 

I opted for their most popular item, the Mo Ramyun! This is the perfect choice if you're looking to get ramen with a little bit of everything. I believe it came with pork belly, chicken, egg and some veggies. The server warned me that this may be a bit too spicy when I ordered it but the spice was very tolerable. Tbh it probably could've used some more spice... I guess it really depends on your spice tolerance.  

Now IT WAS GOOD, not gonna lie. But... I really don't think its worth the $15.95 price tag, hence the 3 stars. $12 maybe - but $15.95 is pushing it for literally a bowl of instant noodles with added meats and veggies that you can make yourself at home. 

We also ordered the ramyun chicken wings to share. It's super breaded, which I love! Its not the best chicken wings I've ever had but its still very tasty and a great appetizer to share with friends. 

Regardless of the price, I'd still recommend Mo' Ramyun to friends if they're really craving instant noodles and are too lazy to make their own ..and wouldn't mind spending. I'd probably still return, but I will try out other things on their menu.

Let me start by saying how excited I am that Vaughan FINALLY has a Korean restaurant (even if its ramen). I also don't understand why so many reviews complain about the price. The average ramen bowl at any given restaurant goes for $12-13 and Mo' Ramyun serves ramen in GIANT bowls, hence the price tag. 

We came here on a Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty empty. Although it looks deceivingly small from the outside, there is a large dining room and even a patio (which will hopefully open in the summer). The menu is also fairly large (contrary to some complaints), there are Ramyun bowls and Dry Ramyun plates (noodles with no broth). The menu also has some appetizers worthy of checking out, like the fried tofu. 

We ordered the Mo' Ramyun ($15.99) which came with BBQ pork, grilled pork belly, and a lot of vegetables. The broth itself had a nice smokiness to it, which makes the dish really addicting. The only complain I have is that whoever cut the vegetables needs to improve their knife skills. The pieces were chunky and very uneven. We also ordered the Jajang Ramyun ($9.99 for a small) and the Jajang (black bean sauce) was not thick enough. The Age Tofu ($6.99) was great, although there was nothing aged about it. 

The service was fast & kind. The only issue I had was that the waiters stared at the patrons as they were eating. Not sure how the others felt, but it made me slightly uncomfortable. 

Overall, a decent restaurant with adorable decor and good dishes. Not a typical Korean restaurant (no banchan), but the portions make up for that. I think there is a lot of room for improvement, but given that it is a new restaurant, I hope that the owners take all the reviews into account.","['bulgogi', 'friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap', 'bulgogi', 'tteokbokki']",0

The rice in the bibimbap really needs more salt or or a spicier sauce...there were dull parts of it. I know you'd say we should mix the food a bit more, but even the components weren't as on point as they should be. Nothing really stood out.

Next was the soon tofu soup. They chopped up the tofu and it felt like they reduced the amount that was put in normally. They did however add seafood and lots of shrimp, which I thought was nice considering it's higher price point.

To be fair the food was ok. A bit expensive and not traditional but it wasn't bad. And NO I won't be returning. Drive a few streets east and have yourself a real Korean meal.

The gam ja tang broth isn't quite as rich as at some other Korean restaurants, but it's still pretty good. The ramen broth that we tried was very good. Unfortunately, the bibimbap doesn't have that lovely, crunchy rice on the bottom of the bowl which is our only criticism of that dish.

The washrooms are very clean and they even provide mouthwash and hand cream, which we thought was a nice touch. 

All in all, this is a solid Korean option in Vaughan and we'll definitely be back.","['bulgogi', 'friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap', 'bulgogi', 'tteokbokki']",1

We live in walking distance to the restaurant and pass it all the time.  I was under the impression that Korean BBQ meant you had to cook your own food at your table as I did long ago when i lived in L.A.  This is not the case.  

The atmosphere is modern and quality.  We ordered Soon Tofu Soup (seafood) and Dolsot Bipimbap.  Both were excellent and very fresh tasting.  

Las Vegans are often (always) in a rush, so i understand the slow service comments.  However, this place has the feel of a family restaurant.  A place where i want to take my time eating and enjoy the food.

My wife order the Maru Punch adult drink and she commented on how much larger it was compared to anywhere else.  On the strip, the drink would be a quadruple.  Have someone else drive you home if your order one.

The staff were very friendly and the place was spotless.  The hostess was super nice too.  She intruduced herself to all of the guests.",['galbigui'],1

They have a beautiful full bar and a good selection of cocktails and beers. No sushi, which is a shame since the sushi bar looks really nice. 
I come for the Soon Tofu stew, which is always really good, but very mild. Ask them to make it extra spicy to get a more flavorful stew. 
The banchan is pretty good too. I haven't tried the barbeque, but I've seen others ordering it, and they look like huge portions.

Since I wasn't paying I was able to order pretty much anything I wanted, which was absolutely fantastic. I would highly recommend going to dinner when you're not paying!!! But I was there with about 100 other people. It must have been a doozy.

I alone ordered 2 orders of unmarinated dung-shim (certified angus beef steaks), 6 orders of marinated galbi bbq short ribs, 2 sashimi platters, 2 orders of uni, a sushi platter, and muhl naeng myun (cold buckwheat noodles soup). Ok, I didn't eat this all by myself. I was sharing with 4 other people. We also did have a bunch of alcohol too. 

The dung-shim was very good. The steaks were nicely marbled so they came out oh so tender. The galbi's marinated was pretty good (not too sweet or too salty and also tender). All of the fish came out very fresh, even the uni. Do NOT I repeat do NOT EVER EVER EVER order the muhl naeng myun. Horrible. WAY TOO SWEET. I heard the bibim naeng myun was pretty good. They brought out around 12 side dishes (banchan) which all were very, for lack of a better word, yummy. After this FEAST, I was VERY thankful I wasn't paying. I was estimating the bill came out to around $7000($50/person + alcohol).

Service was good considering they got slammed with 100 people all at once on top of their normal dinner crowd. The price was not so good. Looking at the menu brought fear to my wallet.  The owner did spend a pretty penny on this restaurant. Considering the neighborhood, she had to in order to make it fit the area, I mean she even put til on the stall walls!

I love trendy settings, but I also love tasty food served in less than fashionable surroundings. If I had to choose, I would take food over fashion any day of the week and twice on Sunday.

I went to Maru for a loner lunch and ordered vegetable sundubu. The ingredients are fresh, and the banchan kept me happy. However, the sundubu was mild and, sadly, bland. I hate sad sundubu days.

From reading the other reviews, perhaps the real star at Maru is the BBQ or bibimbap. Maybe they are so excited about meat that they forget about the timid tofu. I give them an A+ for interior. 

Right after my meal, I thought I would be giving Maru 2-stars, and solely for sundbu it may be 2-stars, despite the super fresh ingredients. Now, I am giving them a little bump for maintaining a clean, attractive restaurant that can serve as a gateway for adventurous eats.

621,RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,Maru Korean BBQ & Sushi,2.0,,"Yesterday afternoon we dined at Maru, a Korean and Japanese restaurant located off Town Center in Summerlin. I must say Korean food is not one of my favorite cuisines, perhaps because Koreans are very adept at food preservation and I've never been a huge fan of anything fermented, with the exception of alcohol. Something about the little fizz attached to fermented foods makes me a little squeamish. Kimchi is a great example, although it can also be prepared fresh, which I prefer. In any case, I like to expose myself to all cuisines so I still eat Korean food occasionally.

The Korean dish I like the most is bibimbap, which is not only fun to say, but also fun to eat. It is an authentic dish that is accessible to the American pallet, best served in a hot stone pot. It consists of white rice topped with a pretty display of meat, a variety of vegetables, and a raw egg, along with a sweet and spicy sauce. The first time my husband and I had this dish we got it without the egg and started eating the toppings first, dipping them in the sauce. We were corrected by the waitress who came over and poured the sauce over the toppings, then used a long metal spoon to mix all the contents of the pot together into a tasty hodge-podge. After she did so the dish made more sense, and the next time I didn't omit the raw egg since the heat of the rice and the pot cooks it to a state I much prefer. Bibimbap is served at almost all Korean restaurants and usually one pot is enough for two average eaters, so it is as affordable as it is yummy (at Maru it is$9.99).

Korean food is always accompanied by banchan, or little side dishes, so I find this is a good way to try Korean specialties without having to make a whole meal out of them. The side dishes can range from seaweed and fishcakes to cold mashed potatoes and kimchi, and generally you are served about five of them. The banchan at Maru are very good, and I appreciate that they always change so you have a bit different experience each time.

Ian ordered the spicy pork lunch special which wasn't as good as the bibimbap. The flavor was fine but the pork was very oily and it was hard to find the good cuts of meat in the pile. It came with mediocre tempura, an average salad, rice, and a delicious cup of miso soup (one of the better I've had). We agreed we probably wouldn't order it again.

Maru, which has a lovely modern dining room complete with mini atrium, also has a sushi bar. I ordered sashimi here once and thought it was incredibly fresh, though the rolls on the menu aren't as interesting as say, Sushi Fever. It's nice that the restaurant offers two cuisines so you can please all the pallets in your party, but really the bibimbap is the only reason I see to come here.",['galbigui'],1

I came here for lunch with a $30 Groupon. The first thing I noticed was the modern and trendy ambiance. All of the walls seemed to be made out of glass, the tables and booths were made out of a dark wood that went well with all the bamboo lined up in the center of the dining area, and there was a colorful bar area in the other half of the restaurant near the restrooms. Since we came at 11am, there were only a few other parties, so it made for a very chill environment. 

After perusing the menu, we decided upon the Dolsot Bibimbap, Yokgajang, Jogi Gui, and chicken wings. The Jogi Gui was a lunch special so it came with rice, tempura, salad, and gyoza. We got our chicken wings first. They were pretty mediocre with nothing standing out about them besides the vibrant color. The Yokgajang came out in a giant bowl and it was more than enough for the both of us. I'm not a fan of anything spicy, but I actually enjoyed this (as much as my taste buds could handle). It was very flavorful and the spice definitely added a nice kick. The bibimbap came in a very large stone pot that took up almost the entire space in front of me. I've been craving bibimbap, so I dug in right away. It was hearty and delicious! I was so distracted by it that I just stopped eating anything else that we ordered and gave the bibimbap all of my attention. My favorite part was the crunchy bits of rice and egg that got stuck on the bottom of the pot. The dish went perfectly with all the banchan they gave us. If I didn't live so far, I'd probably come here twice a week just for the bibimbap. 

Overall, the presentation of all the food was perfect, the ambiance was very relaxing, and the food was tasty. I'd probably save this place for a nice lunch or dinner date though because you're definitely paying for the ambiance and I'm sure you'd want to enjoy it with someone ;)",['galbigui'],1

I have only been to a few Korean BBQ places but I am really starting to get in to it.  I am not an expert at Korean food, but this place was excellent.  I have been to 3 other Korean joints in town and this was by far the nicest one.",['galbigui'],1

Maru is a good spot for Korean if you just can't make it to Chinatown.   I've enjoyed their dolsot bibimbap several times and it's one of my favorites in town.  It's a big portion, so, come hungry.  Maru also brings out a decent selection of banchan and they are happy to refill, and refill, and refill....

Their seafood sundubu, however, is another story. It's watery and relatively flavorless.  Especially gross was that all the shrimp in my soup were not de-veined. Sick. The other seafood in the wasn't much better - mostly rubbery and overcooked.

Service can be spotty here, so, if you're looking for attention, steer clear.",['galbigui'],0

We started with the seafood pancake, which was quite large and chalk full of seafood. I had the bipimbop (sp?), which is typically a rice, veggie, egg and meat sampler in a stone bowl served with optional spicy sauce. I asked them to leave off the meat (as I am a pescatarian), and the chef added some delicious tofu. Yum! The best part is the rice on the bottom of the bowl that gets crispy and delicious - it did not disappoint. My husband had the bulgagi (Korean BBQ). It was a very large plate of shaved meat that he absolutely gorged on. 

In all, we loved our meal. The restaurant was, sadly, quite empty. I hope more people try it soon.

644,tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,Maru Korean BBQ & Sushi,5.0,,"What was fresh about this place?  The waitresses' bad attitude and poor service.  3 of us did the AYCE for $26, and 1 person ordered a korean dish.  

First off, when we got seated, the waitress took 3 out of the 4 drink orders, and then walked away. We had to shout the 4th drink order.  After we ordered our AYCE sushi items (limited to one order of sea urchin (uni) and 1 order of sweet shrimp, we waited... and waited... for our food. The appetizers like the tempura and gyoza were fine, although I had to ask for tempura sauce.  What place does not bring tempura sauce with tempura? This should have been a red flag, as I had to ask for it. The rest of the sushi came out very very slow, especially for being nearly empty on a friday night at 7pm.  
Finally the first sushi order (tuna) came out.  It's one thing if the sushi looks like it got rolled over by a car and died 2 weeks ago, but it actually tasted like it died 2 weeks ago and got rolled over by a car, and then sliced and put on top a very hefty wad of mushy rice.  It was tasteless.  The lack of flavor was attempted to be hidden by the sushi chef adding a clump of wasabi underneath.  
The rice quality was nothing that great either. It was a step above the quality of rice found at the supermarket.  
Everything else that came out had no flavor and there was a lack of excitement about the food.  
We had to wait 90 minutes before we finally got fed up, and said, where is our uni?!  The manager in charge said he would go check.  He came back a couple minutes later saying it would be out in a couple minutes as they just opened up a new box.  (Really?  they couldn't have opened up the new box when we ordered the food?)  The uni was fine, nothing horrible, but nothing that great either.  
The last sushi order they brought out was the white tuna which I usually like, but it was just horrible.  It was warm, melted in your mouth (not because it was good quality, but because it was just so waterlogged), and it had a weird almost alcoholic flavor to it. I spit it out and sent it back via the waitress who plainly ignored me until another waitress came by.  They were also very slow at servicing our table as we would stack our own plates to make room.  We also had to constantly ask for tea, but at least they kept my friend's soda cup full.  
My korean friend told me that her korean dish was awful as well. She only ate half of it.  
Overall, this restaurant is horrible.  The korean food is not good, and neither is the sushi.  1 star was given because that's the bare minimum that must be given and inside the restaurant looked very nice and modern.   This place does not deserve to serve sushi.",['galbigui'],0
645,slI4wdRXGdhd8AeCEaMdoQ,Maru Korean BBQ & Sushi,2.0,,"Maru was all in all a very pleasant and rewarding dinner location for me and my girlfriend.

First impression: Incredible curb appeal, very upscale, hip and classy decor and presentation.  In a good neighborhood.  Other Korean Restaurants in Vegas are in the part of town where you're concerned about leaving your belongings in your car... NOT MARU!  Its tucked away in a business section of Summerlin with plenty of parking.  There is plenty of room for waiting though we didn't have to.

Main Points: The restaurant is an authentic, Korean BBQ.  It is one of the few places in vegas you can get genuine Korean food prepared on a stove at your table or in a hot pot, served raw, etc.  Those reviewers criticizing the AYCE Sushi menu should bear in mind that this is not the primary focus of the establishment, but rather another offering to appeal to a wider audience, as Korean food tends to be extremely esoteric.  Service gripes seem to frequent some of the other reviews, but I have none.  Our hostess, waitress, and busser were all pleasant, helpful, and happy.

Food: I ordered four of the traditional, served raw Korean entrees and cooked them at the table for the full experience.  I was not displeased.  The quality of the ingredients was top-notch, and the facilities and atmosphere as well as the assistance from the wait staff was very helpful.

The AYCE sushi was ordered by another in our party.  If there is a scale for measuring Sushi quality, it would have grocery store sushi as a 1, and high quality a'la carte as a 10.  This sushi would have to be considered around a 4.  It was definitely good quality fish, and some of the specialty rolls are incredibly good, with interesting flavor combinations.  Some of the nagiri sushi, however, was a bit disappointing when compared with some other AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas.  I am readily prepared to forgive this though, for the reason mentioned earlier in the review.  The Korean food was superb.

Bottom Line: If looking for a night out at a classy Asian food restaurant with friends in Vegas, and you're off the strip, this is a very satisfying location.    Summerlin community, give them a try!",['galbigui'],1
646,P8zNvht_iXkpkv74yrNUEA,Maru Korean BBQ & Sushi,4.0,,"The first time I went to Maru, I went with a large group as a guest of a family member of the owners.  So we got personal service and never ending Bulgogi and Sushi.  It was my first Korean BBQ experience and I was hooked! 
The salad is addicting and sushi is good (not huge like many places, but nice manageable pieces) and Bulgogi is heavenly.  The decor is so nice and you feel like you should be on The Strip and not in a business park. 

Since then I have been to Korean Gardens, but decided to give Maru a shot with my own wallet (Ok, my Boyfriends) because we didn't want to go down to China-Town.  I might say that Korean Garden might be a bit better, but I would never turn down a dinner at Maru. I prefer that Salad at Maru over KG! hah.

I really want to give this place 1 star but I'm pretty much ranting on the AYCE sushi aspect of this restaurant.  I only came here because it was the closest sushi place from my buddies house and to be honest, I was PUMPED to come here since I was starving for AYCE sushi and wanted to try some new stuff.

The building is aesthetically pleasing and it does have a warm/cozy feel to it.  But the service was lacking (mainly since the waitress seemed to forget that I existed). 

Anyways, I look at all the stuff on the menu then come to find out every single thing I planned on ordering from the AYCE sushi was not on the AYCE sushi menu.

Comes with all the typical accrutements... kimchi, dried fish, white radish, pickled cucumbers, dried squid, etc. The stew was also great with lots of fresh seafood. We usually get Korean food in San Diego and this place is on par with the best places in San Diego.  It's nice to find a good Korean restaurant so close to home!  We didn't try the sushi, but we will try it next time and I will do an update.  

I also strongly recommend the martinis.  I had the pomegranate martini and it was terrific!  The service was impeccable and everyone was really nice and attentive.  The decor is really nice, too.  A lot of glass with bamboo trees in the middle.

It was served with raw yolk (which cooked with the other ingredients when it came in contact with the hot stone bowl) and a delicious assortment of veggies.

Two days later and I still can't get over just how good it was...I love tendon and compared to pho, which has sparse amounts of meat with a lot of noodles, sul lung tang is the exact opposite (at LEAST 15 pieces). Dip that in their sauce that has a hint of horseradish (soooo good) and I was in heaven. The only thing I didn't really care for was the small amount of noodles in my sul lung tang - they were way too soft.

My friend's Korean boyfriend highly recommended this place for their sul lung tang as the best thing for hangovers, saying it was better than the places in LA which has an actual K-town. I've never had sul lung tang before, but I'm taking his word for it. The milky bone broth comes plain and you add salt, pepper, red pepper paste, and green onions to your liking. Not oily at all like how pho broth can be - definitely a healthy comfort food.

The ban chan here consists simply of two large clay pots of homemade radish and cabbage kimchi that you cut yourself, and a plate of fresh shishito peppers that you can dip in ssamjang. At first I was disappointed with the small variety, but oh my god that radish kimchi was BOMB. Pretty much finished that pot single-handedly, and radish kimchi is usually my least favorite type of kimchi. Their kimchi has a stronger anchovy taste which I personally really liked.

This mom and pop shop has won a special place in my heart.

After reading his review several times decided to try this place. Love it. 

First is the green onions and chili paste for your soup. Peppers and dipping sauce that thankfully is not too hot and then bowls of kimchee the cabbage and radish. Love how you also have a plate to put the kimchee on and scissors to cut them. You can keep adding more kimchee as you eat them from the bowl.   The Kim Chee was absolutely awesome. 

We had the oxtail and the combo. They both come out very hot and you can add as much chili paste and green onions to your liking.

The oxtail was tasty and tender. I love to gnaw on the bones. The only thing I would say is a bit of veggies and bigger chunks of oxtail would make this an ideal meal for me. This was the first time I had oxtail soup instead if stew at a restaurant. I enjoyed this or at least the bits I could steal from the wife. 

The combo had brisket, tendon, tripe, and was tasty yet a bit sparse in terms of meat. I did not get any bones so next time I am trying the beef knee bone soup. Again I really enjoy more veggies in a soup as I make my own with pork bones , mushroom and cabbage. It adds to the overall consistency. Here I would say tasty yet anemic. Tasty though. 

I would like to give the 4.5 and will be back. I will try the 24.99 assorted boiled beef with some folks as I am sure you share this.

So over the years I have driven past this unassuming restaurant that practically blends in with the other random businesses on this stretch of E Sahara, and never really given it a second thought.  So I am glad that we the typical question about where to get dinner ultimately lead us to E-Jo Korean Restaurant.

Their menu is pleasantly simple. Just 2 pages worth, and almost all of it is dedicated to the various traditional Korean soups not found at other Korean restaurants. These soups are the final product of hours of slow simmering to extract the flavors from the beef bones used in its preparation.  You can order the soup according to the meats and other ingredients that you want served in it.  If you are a beginner, then go with item #1 (Brisket Beef Soup for $9.99). If you are adventurous, then order item #8 (Their Combination Beef Soup with all the ingredients listed in items 1-7).

The soups themselves are what many would considered bland, but that is completely intentional. And sea salt is available on the table for diners to adjust their soup to their individual taste (very good for individuals with high blood pressure or are on a low sodium diet, since it is easy to add salt but impossible to get it out).  Besides that, there are Korean spicy chili paste and another soybean paste and garlic mixture for flavoring the soup or as a dip for the cucumber chili (most were not spicy, but there were a few that did packed some heat, so be careful if you don't like it too spicy).

In the end I opted for item #3 (Beef Knee Bone Soup with Tendon, $13.99).  If you like soft tendons, there are a lot of it in here, but no other pieces of beef.  Overall, this alone was just okay for me even with all of the tinkering that went into fine tuning my soup.

The surprised highlight of the meal for me and probably everyone I ate with (Michael K and Roger T) is the restaurant's house made kimchi (2 varieties: radish and cabbage).  As far as banchans are concerned relative to other Korean restaurants, the selection is minimal.  However, what the E-Jo lack in kimchi selections is more than make up by the quality and flavors that they packed.  I will be happy with a few servings of rice and their kimchi, and maybe just a small bowl of soup or side order of Stir Fried Ribeye or Spicy Pork.  The kimchis are that mind blowningly good!  Forget the other K-Restaurant's commercially sourced industrial kimchis.  I want E-Jo's artisanal kimchi goodness!

Service was friendly and efficient. The food came out with nominal wait time.  You can help yourself to as much kimchi as you want.  However, be polite and considerate and get the kimchi out of the jar with the provided tongs and put it on the serving plate first (no ones wants your cootie crossed contaminated double dipped leftover kimchi, not even your GF or BF).

In the mood to drink responsibly?  They offer, you guessed it, Soju!  Plus Korean beers and rice wines and soda for me.

For entertainment, besides staring at your iPhone or Android devices and neglecting your dining companions (okay if you are Yelping, but only because I am Yelping too), catch up on Korean programming of the variety show category on their TV (at least that was what was on at the time of my visit).  

Afraid of ordering wrong because you are not Korean, can't speak Korean, but you still want to madly impressed your Korean GF or just being  culinaryly (I am making up words because of their kimchi) adventurous minus the requisite language skill, have no fear! pictures of menu items are on the wall for easy visual reference.  Or just ask the restaurant staff taking your order, silly.

(Getting the frantic hand signals to wrap it up)

E-Jo, a good Korean soup restaurant to visit, especially as the thermometer starts dipping towards your feet.  Lastly, awesome kimchi!

4 stars! **** out of *****

Trivial observation: Their soups all look the same to me here.  But I can assure you I am not a soup racist. I have had soups from many culinary traditions in the past. Just the other day I thoroughly enjoyed a miso soup, and before that an Italian Wedding Soup, and a very invigorating cold Borscht from Russia (or was it or Ukrainian origin) just over the summer. My point is I am not a soup racist.","['galbitang', 'bibimbap', 'doenjangjjigae', 'kimchijjigae']",1

674,4ARwcluRdI346WJhMB5eBw,E-Jo Korean Restaurant,5.0,,"Summary:
All the soups are delicious and are a great treat when the temperature is cold outside. Often go up to 3 times a week dependent on the fact of if I have a hangover from drinking or not, or if I want something not as salty and heart warming. It is more or less like chicken noodle soup for Asians.

Decor:
Very cute and Korean inside, I love the Korean TV playing in the background. The chopsticks, pots, bowls, and even how kimchi is presented is very cute.

Service: 
Great service and since the server found out that our party was not Korean so she explained in how to eat the soup properly (adding salt and onion, meat dipping sauce, cold dish peppers, etc). 

Price:
Ox tail soup comes at a pleasant not too expensive 15.99 while the best bang for the buck my favorite would be #2 which include all sorts of meat and intestine (12.99). The basic Brisket Beef Soup is 11.99. All the soups are very well priced, not too high but no steal for sure.

Final Thoughts:
Delicious and good for cold days. Or if you have been drinking or is sick, the soup is to die for.","['galbitang', 'bibimbap', 'doenjangjjigae', 'kimchijjigae']",1

When we first got there we didn't get a word in before she started pointing at the menu items and recommending the common safe dishes like bulgogi. Since we weren't Korean she probably assumed we wouldn't like the soups(which is basically what they are known for). It doesn't make sense to recommend something that isn't a house specialty. Then after we ordered two of their soups she asked us if we wanted kimchi. What do you mean, would we like some? It's a Korean restaurant, of course we want kimchi. It's always a provided staple. Again, just because we were foreigners and she didn't expect us to be knowledge or appreciative of her cuisine. She never refilled our drinks even though the restaurant was small and we were one of two customers. The worst part was at the end of the meal. I left a cash tip on the table and my boyfriend went to go pay with card. After he signs the receipt and starts walking away she yells after him telling him he didn't leave a tip. He felt embarrassed, especially since she yelled in front of her other customers.

680,52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,E-Jo Korean Restaurant,4.0,,"So unfortunately the best Korean restaurant in town is on the east side, far far away from my house...  This place across the street from Commercial Center is, in my opinion, the best traditional Korean restaurant in Vegas, by a mile.  Most Korean restaurants are bbq places, and even those are just mediocre.  The only other specialty Korean seems to be tofu joints, except for this place which specializes in gomtang, a soup that is similar to sullungtang and cooked in bone marrow.  

They have parking in the back, but you have to walk around to the front to enter.  It is your typical Korean restaurant decor, which is to say it's not much to speak of.  Service is friendly and speedy.  The menu consists of a various type of gomtang (different main ingredient) and several other popular Korean dishes.  Although oxtail gomtang is one of my favorite dish, we opt for a combination gomtang and a naengmyun.  I'm guessing the gomtang is already made, but perhaps because of naengmyun preparation both dishes take about 10 minutes to come out.

The naengmyun is quite good, with nicely flavored and cold soup.  Wish there was a tad more brisket slices in it though, but otherwise very satisfying.  The gomtang soup tasted great also, and the accompanying kimchi and radish kimchi (kkakdugi) were outstanding.  The kimchi is quite sweet, but I actually liked it.  I am definitely getting the oxtail gomtang next time.

I've probably tried 90% of Korean restaurants in Vegas, and it's not an impressive lot overall except Soyo which is very good, K-bop which is satisfying, and couple in Commercial Center that have a handful of good dishes.  So this one is a keeper, with great service and food on par with typically good places in L.A.  It's a solid 4 stars.

Don't ask me the authentic names, I don't know them, but the pancake, beef with veggies, and the assorted beef soup were all incredible. I tried beef tongue and tendon for the first time, and thoroughly enjoyed both. The tendon is a bit gelatinous, and the tongue tastes just like any other cut of beef. We got two cold buckwheat noodle dishes, and I definitely prefered the broth preparation to the chili paste preparation. I WILL warn you however, that these noodles were EXTREMELY difficult to bite through. I took a big bite thinking that I could just bite them off, but I couldn't, and kind of wound up choking a little. The super kind server came rushing over to see if I was okay, or if the food was too spicy. And I was embarrassed. White chicks eating Korean food wrong. Boo.

711,XopP_70iyfC3iCPAY-sz4Q,E-Jo Korean Restaurant,5.0,,"It has been sometime since I've come here. Not because this place isn't great but it's because its super far from me! I rarely am on this side of town.

In 2014, this place was first introduced to me by my friend. She has since moved back to her country but E-Jo will give me fond memories of her.

I came after class. It was a little busier than I remember it. But this is like a mom and pop store. They don't typically sell the tofu soup or the typical Korean BBQ dishes. So if you're looking for BBQ or Tofu soup, this place probably isn't it. 

I've tried the oxtail soup, the hangover soup, and the beef tongue soup. ALL WERE AMAZING! When you're feeling cold or need something to warm up the belly, this is the spot.

The oxtail soup was clear and full of flavor. Now, please keep in mind it's not seasoned. They give you sea salt on the side and some red sauce you can put in it or other things you can use to season it. I'd suggest 2.5 spoons of salt and some of that red pepper paste, not the dipping one! 

The hangover soup is probably my favorite dish. This one needs the least amount of seasoning because the soup itself has a lot of flavor. If you love a load of veggies, that is THE soup to go for. However, if you're not a brave soul and can't eat that pigs blood, don't do it. But I LOVE pigs blood.

The beef tongue was really great! I was hesitant in ordering this because through my experience, the beef tongue is usually very chewy if its cooked in soup. Well, I'm glad I picked this soup! Once again, adding 2.5 spoons of salt (lightly, not loaded spoon) and that red pepper paste it was full of flavor and delicious. The beef tongue was the softest beef tongue I've ever eaten! It was great! It also had a dipping sauce that my SO hogged so I didn't get much of it, but whatever I  had to dip it with was great!

I forgot about that bonchon, its pretty simple, but I LOVE their kimchi! Kimchi, raddish kimchi, and korean chili peppers. This place is the only one that does the korean chili peppers but i find myself craving these every so often and dipping it into that seasoned red pepper paste.

The server was super friendly and tried to accommodate our large group. She even held an empty table for us because we said more of our group was coming. Although the service was great, the food was disappointing. I had Mul Naengmyun, one of my favorite Korean dishes and something you would think is perfect for the Las Vegas heat. The noodles were not cold enough and they just didn't seem to be the best quality. The broth left something to be desired.

I also took a few bites of his spicy BBQ chicken. I'd recommend you pass on that dish as well. In a city with so many great restaurants, there's no reason to subject yourself to the low quality and high priced food at E-Jo.

The dimly lit restaurant made my sister initially curse, because she thought it was closed. 

Once we sat down, the waitress brought two cups of the iced barley tea. No chilled metal cups, but the tall plastic ones will do. 

The food is similar price to other Korean restaurants in Vegas, but that is the only similarity they share. The thing about E-Jo is that they do not serve the most common Korean soups, so you will not find kimchijjigae (kimchi soup) or soondubujjigae (spicy soft tofu soup). Instead they had a beef brisket (9.99), tripe, tongue, and an all of the above soup (13.99). My sister and I split the beef brisket and the cold buckwheat noodles in a chilled soup (9.99). The former was steaming hot with generous amounts of meat and noodles. It comes with a bowl of rice, a huge pot of cabbage and radish kimchi, and lots of green onions to sprinkle in. The best way to eat it is to throw your rice into the broth and add gochujang (the red chili paste). A dash of salt goes a long way too. Like seullongtang, you need to season it to your liking, otherwise it might be too bland. Another way I learned to eat it, in Korea, was to add a little bit of the juice from the radish kimchi. It might sound odd, but the taste is amazing. 

The naengmyeon is a true summer dish. The tangy vinegar beef broth is chilled with the addition of ice cubes. It comes with half a hard boiled egg, two pieces of brisket, pickled radish, cucumbers, and a horseradish mustard on the side. My sister has been complaining about how unbearable this heat was and she was relieved to devour this dish. The banchan are minimal, but what they do give is top notch. I almost inhaled both pots of kimchi and they do not skimp on the portion. There were also some cucumber peppers that are served with ssamjang (a mixture of garlic, red pepper and soybean paste). They are not spicy and perfect for summer.","['galbitang', 'bibimbap', 'doenjangjjigae', 'kimchijjigae']",1

In hindsight, I should've just driven but I was too lazy to get my car out of the parking structure. It cost $11 cab fare to get there. Then I paid $5 tip. I know. Dumb. It was actually worse on the way back. The owner of the restaurant called us a Korean cab to get back to the hotel. He charged us $20!!! What a ripoff!! Anyway, I digress. So, the moral of the story is if you decide to check out this place, and you have a car, just drive there. 

So, I got the oxtail soup, my mom got the Kalgooksoo, and my Aunt got the soup with the greens in it. I thought my oxtail soup was  good! Broth was flavorful. My meat was a little tough...I mean I was fighting with it to get off the bone. But still pretty good. The cabbage Kimchee and the radish Kimchee both were really good! They also gave us peppers with daenjang. The peppers with fresh and crunchy! Really good! 

My mom and aunt said their food was just ok. They said it was bland. Lol. But they live in LA, so they always compare Korean food to the restaurants in Ktown.

I didn't realize that it was pretty much soups only, but I dove right in and ordered the 'everything' soup, and my friend had the #1. The server brought out interesting tasting tea (I realize now that its iced barley, but I enjoyed it) as well as kimchi. I asked her about the white chunky kimchi, because I've had the cabbage kind before. It is radish kimchi; they both were very tasty. 
When our soups came out, they tasted bland, so I put alot of salt, green onions, and chili into it, and it was delicious. I loved the oxtail as well as the broth- it was very substantial. All of the meat in the soup was good, and dipping it into the sauce provided helped the flavor of the more blander cuts.

The place is not big but also not tiny, I have had to wait a little bit during lunch time. Nice service, the ladies don't speak much English but enough to get you what you want, they are always nice and polite, drinks are always refilled. 

Among the many things I like about this place I love their homemade kimchi and radish! Unlike other Korean places they do not offer a variety of side dishes, they offer their homemade kimchi and radishes and raw pepper with dipping sauce. Kimchi and radishes are served in clay pot, served in big chunks they will cut half for you and leave the rest for you to cut if you want more! These are delicious!! A little saucy and sweet with a little kick! Love that they are served in big chunks!

I always get the combination soup, white broth with brisket, ox tail, tendon, honeycomb, and intestine! Such a good soup, plenty of meat and noodles, you can add more scallion if you want and add salt yourself. Soup always served boiling hot and tastes amazing! Their hangover soup is also really good! I prefer the combination for the variety of meats. 

It's about $16 for a soup which can be a little expensive, but it does come with rice and homemade veggies, and for the taste I do not mind the price.

1. The food is extremely expensive. Gomtang at LA usually goes for about 7$ and here it's $10. 
2. Customer service is horrible. We ordered a korean pancake and they said they ran out when we came here for breakfast. And they didn't provide anything to make up for it. 
3. We have a little baby in the family and asked if we could just have a small bowl of soup for her because she wasn't hungry to eat a lot. They said they can't give it for free and it costs half price of the adult bowl. At LA they always give a little to babies just for service. And when they gave it, it came with no meat. Just soup for like 5 bucks. 
4. The gontang soup tastes just okay. The soup is a little clear and it's because they use a lot of water and I can taste the msg in it. I'm gonna be super thirsty later. 
5. The one star only goes for the kkak doo gee (Korean kimchi radish) and the kimchee but I would not come again. 
Even after the horrible service, they still charged us for the little soup. 

This just shows that they want money and don't care about their customers because they have no competition. They're the only Korean restaurant around.

818,1a60tzkZy_9iruwRZl9nyQ,E-Jo Korean Restaurant,4.0,,"3 1/2 stars.

We came here because my gf's, and myself included were pretty hungover. Especially the birthday girl (mission completed)! hahaha.. She mentioned she came here last time and that it was pretty good. I wanted Earl of Sandwich instead but b-day girl gets what she wanted and she really needed it. 

There is a parking lot in the back. The inside is pretty big, spacious and clean. The menu is pretty simple but good selections of different dishes to choose from. They have soups/Broths, noodles, pan grilled meat dishes and a few other dishes. 

_Boiled Beef ($24.99 medium) This is an appetizer but also can be eaten as extra meat when you order your Brisket Beef soup as the meat is similar. The boiled beef comes in very thin slices. Pretty lean and oil free, which is why I liked this. A bit bland is taste so they give a sweet sauce on the side to dip it. I recommend getting this to share when waiting for your food.
_Brisket Beef Soup ($10.99) This is a staple dish here and seems to be pretty popular.. Seolleongtang is a Korean broth made from ox bones, briskets and other cuts. The seasoning is usually made at the table as it comes very bland. You add your own amount of salt and pepper and chopped spring onions. As everyone as their own level of saltiness and spice. It can be made very clean and clear or milky and a slight thick white cloud color. I've had many great ones in Koreatown in LA. so can't say this is the best or close to it but for Vegas it is pretty good. The beef was good, wish they added a bit more, and I liked the noodles. The broth was clean, not too salty or heavy. Always comes with a bowl of rice, some like to add it all in the soup, I like to eat it on the side so I can control how much rice I eat. 

The sides they serve are Kimchi and Kkakdugi (a variety of kimchi in Korean cuisine. Usually, it has all the ingredients of kimchi, but the baechu (Napa cabbage) used for kimchi is replaced with Korean daikon). When a restaurant is known for mainly soups you don't get much side dishes because all you really need is kimchi. They also serve gochu (Korean green chili pepper) and a side of red chili paste. The gochu is not spicy so do not worry. It was a bit mild yet crisp and refreshing. 

The food was good, the only reason I did not give 4 stars and gave it 3 (but round up to 3 1/2 stars) was the service. Our waitress was not polite and was pretty stand off ish. You can tell she did not want to be there and I get it, I been there done that, but you are still working and in the field of customer service. It's not like we were being rude or difficult. The inside was pretty empty and it took us about 30 min to get our food! She did not come by to give us a heads up or even give our appetizer which we asked for, and she said it was coming soon but it never did. Even the customers who came after us got their meals 12 min in or so. I don't know if it's because we were real hungry but when I checked yelp on my check in time, yup it was 30 minutes.

Not much in menu selection or banchan side dishes, but what they do have is very good and authentic Korean.  Lots of Korean patrons, a fair indication of how good and authentic the Korean food is.  Decent parking.  Usually crowded when we come either on the weekdays or weekends.  Wish LA had this type of kimchee.  If they sold it, I would buy some.and bring back to LA.

With that said, I have never been here. The Korean restaurants im used to are the cook it yourself all you can eat table top grill kinds. So I was curious as to how this place works.

From looking at the menu it looks simple enough. Everything has a number and is in Korean and English. Since I didn't really want to be that adventurous, I chose the #1 Beef Brisket Soup. It's your basic soup with Beef Brisket and Noodles. 

Now this is where I learned something new. You season the soup yourself meaning they don't put any spices whatsoever in it. On every table there are containers of salt with a mini spoon. For those that are looking for a low to no sodium meal, this is your soup to get! What I ended up doing was grabbing the meat from my soup and eating it with the steamed rice they give you. I would also mix in a little bit of the hot sauce and curry sauce that was provided as well as mild green peppers. 

What actually stole the show was the Kimchi. I have had it before but when I had some of theirs, it tasted really fresh. What I find out was that they make it themselves from scratch. That explains why it was so good. Definitely not from a jar you would be able to buy at Seafood City or Ranch Market.

Service was good. We had a sweet old lady that looked like she would not be able to understand us or speak English well. I was pleasantly surprised when she spoke perfectly good English to us. She was very helpful in answering any questions we threw at her.

As for the place and overall location, I gotta admit, I drive by this place all the time and never really noticed it. Shame on me. But then again, it is in a weird part of the east side of Sahara when most of the food places are on the west side. When you go inside, there are plenty of tables and chairs I would say for about 20 people.

So next time, based on the pics, the Spicy Pork and Spicy Chicken looks really promising.","['galbitang', 'bibimbap', 'doenjangjjigae', 'kimchijjigae']",1

3. Rib-Eye, 15

- The best Kim Chi and Raddish in Las Vegas. Hands Down. Bold Statement. The last time I had Banchan like this was when we ate at Yong SuSan where we basically paid $100 for banchan. HAHA. 
- I knew right away that this was comparable to SoCal Korean food when we entered the restaurant with the waitress welcoming us in her native tongue and they had a Korean TV show on! Perfect! :)
- Friendly service. We got our food fast. Was served both hot and cold tea. She even small talked with the little English she knew. 
- Brisket beef soup was a bit bland for my liking, but was filled with a lot of brisket. I added most of the chili paste in the soup and always dunked my beef in the sauce! Sauce was good. Had a wasabi-like taste. Yum!
- Spicy chicken and rib-eye was exceptional! If I had to chose, I thought the spicy chicken was a bit better. Great flavoring. Lots of grilled onions.

I've heard about E-Jo through friends and fellow yelpers and decided to go last night with a coworker. We both got sizzling hot soups (Gomtang - brisket for me, oxtail for my coworker) and we split spicy buckwheat noodles (Bibimnaengmyun - cold noodles topped with spicy sauce, veggies, and boiled egg)

When I first got the soup, it looked fantastic and I had to dig in. I tasted it and my reaction showed how bland it was. My coworker pointed out the small bowl of salt crystals right in front of us (silly me for missing) that is supposed to be used to add salt to taste. That made a lot more sense to me and I added a small spoonful along with a sprinkle of pepper... My soup was DELISH!

The Kimchi and Kkakdugi (radish) were both very tasty and servers were quick to replenish. A large portion came in small ceramic bowls and you serve and cut them yourself - just like how they do it in soup restaurants in South Korea. We also had spicy Korean peppers to dip in Doenjang (miso paste) which is one of my favorite simple Korean sides.

The Bibimnaengmyun wasn't my favorite. The sauce tasted sweet to me which is extremely strange as this cold noodle dish is supposed to be spicy, not sweet (?) My coworker added more spicy paste to it and finished it off as I only cared for one bite.

For the price, quality, and portions of food, I would absolutely recommend E-Jo. Maybe not for their Bibimnaengmyun... But it's definitely a great place for authentic Korean soup!","['galbitang', 'bibimbap', 'doenjangjjigae', 'kimchijjigae']",1

Korean barbeque and tofu stew joints are aplenty in Spring Mountain, but E-Jo is one of those niche restaurants that specializes in slow cooked beef soups which  one rarely comes across unless you're in a city with a full-fledged Koreatown.
  
Don't be fooled by their limited menu offerings and the simplicity of their banchan since the old saying goes that it is far better to do a few things well than to do many things poorly.  They offer a variety of beef-based broths containing a variety of cuts ranging from brisket, oxtail, and tongue to a variety of other tender bits such as tripe, tendon, and intestine.  The broth has a milky white complexion that can only be achieved from boiling down beef bones for several hours under a low simmer achieving a rich and nourishing soup perfect for a cold winter day or when one is under the weather or post-hangover.   
Sea salt and pepper are provided at the table to adjust the broth to optimum taste and along with the choice of meat, some silky threads of somyeon (wheat flour) noodles and fresh green onion complete the dish.  

Accompaniments include a refreshing glass of barley tea, a few raw green peppers (not spicy, although they look like banana peppers, presumably as a palate cleanser?), and two artisan jars containing perhaps the best made-in-house kimchi in town in the form of radish and napa cabbage cut down table side to bite-size portions by one of the staff.  For the final fine-tuning of flavors, some ground red chili paste and additional green onion are provided for the broth and a spicy soybean paste and horseradish/wasabi based soy sauce for dipping the meats.  Other options include a few choices of grilled meats, nyangmyeon, and a soup with homemade dumplings/rice cakes which have also been well-received in other reviews.

They offer a simple menu but during the winter don't have the cold noodle soup which I had my heart set on. I ordered the number 11: cabbage soup with beef and sponge. The sponge is pork blood I believe. It IS super spongy and not the usually silky texture that I'm used to in Vietnamese dishes. I think the soup was a bit bland but nothing a little salt couldn't fix. They gave us peppers, Kim chi and radish as sides. THE BEST KIM CHI EVER. I wish they sold that stuff separately because I'd buy it by the jug but I don't think they do.... (they should!).

The ambiance of the restaurant is certainly a nice ol school Korean eatery feel and the food and service get my seal of approval for good spots for Korean food here in Las Vegas.  Soups, boiled meats, noodles, meat entree aka Korean BBQ and side drinks.

We came here three times (forgot to check in on one of the nights..) during our stay in Vegas and recommend them highly. Parking is available in the rear and their kimchi and gockdoogi comes in bowls uncut which is definitely a traditional Korean thing. Love it.  Affordable and fills you up real good and all while feeling healthy and guilt free after.


Note for non Koreans, don't be intimidated by the Korean environment, they are nice, speak English, and the menu items are described  in American (specifically North American) as well. 

Finally for those that need some help. I recommend the Korean stew.  #1 off the menu.

Don't forget to season your stew to your liking.  To help the clueless, I do about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt, pepper, 1.5 tablespoon of scallions (green onion looking things), and a 1/2 teaspoon of that red paste and it was the bomb.com

The older lady that always serves us is so sweet.

Here's the run down. The menu is pretty pure and simple. For the banchan, it's kimchee and spicy radishes. But this is seriously the best kimchee ever! It's made in house and they cut it up right in front of you. They also give you peppers to snack on which aren't spicy at all. And the main reason we come here is for their beef brisket or oxtail soup. So a lot of reviews say that the broth is bland. And for lack of a better word, yes it's bland. It's made that way to enhance the flavor of the beef. There is salt, chili paste and green onions to flavor the broth to your liking. We also love the kalbi ribs. They a good amount of meat and fat. They are fall off the bone tender and so full of flavor. All dishes are served with rice so you aren't just eating straight meat.

For the beef brisket soup, I actually felt bad for it not reaching my expectations after all the hype in all the other reviews about it. Everything else was tasty and the staff were friendly, so I just felt bad for thinking it tasted bland. I was probably doing something extremely wrong though, because I read a few more reviews and apparently we should be adding things to the soup.... my bad. I guess I just need to figure out the combination of additional things to add. With all our food items, we had green chili peppers, a sauce that tasted like soy sauce mixed with wasabi, soy bean paste, and chili paste. There's also pepper and flaky looking salt (presumably MSG, at least that's what it tasted like).

Although very friendly like I said, the staff wasn't too quick about giving us our check until we asked, which was okay for us, but may annoy some people.

That sounds pretty boring, but trust me it's not! I literally wanted to walk out after seeing the menu but I'm glad I stayed. Soup? That's literally half of their menu. The other half consists of five typical Korean BBQ dishes.

They have a basic beef broth soup and a hangover soup that's spicy. You choose which meats you want in the soup and this gets served with a couple sides and rice. You add your own salt and spice. I read this while waiting to order and rolled my eyes, but I ended up loving this.

They also have a meat platter you can order in small or large that has the boiled meats on them.

Lastly they have a handful of KBBQ dishes like short ribs, chicken, or bulgogi.

This place has two sides: cabbage kimchi and radish kimchi. These two items are amazing. Best kimchi in Vegas. Super flavorful-basically perfect. They also serve these mild chili's with samjeon(sp).

I never thought I'd have Korean food at 8:30am, but E-Jo changed that for me. I came to E-Jo based on their yelp reviews alone. I didn't expect a restaurant to be filled with business men at 8:30am but they actually had a waiting list on the door! At 8:30am

I do give a shout out to the staff: two servers who were just on top of things. They did everything before I could think of it. Extra napkins, always full cups, always more rice, always checking. They cut up the kimchi for us and also explained how to eat the dishes we ordered. 

E-Jo is a simple place that does a handful of things very well. Their short ribs were $24.99 and served with rice and ban Chan. Sounds steep compared to an AYCE joint but this was definitely worth the price for it's quality. The food is served very quickly and service is very prompt. The place has very limited parking and is what I would consider a whole in the wall-no frills.

Showed up around 10:30 AM on Dec. 18th, right after we picked up our rental car & picked up a few items at the CVS Store a few blocks down The Strip.

We ordered our usuals, the mixed seul long tang soup, and I decided to head over to the bathroom with my baby's bottle, which I'd just bought from CVS since I forgot her bottle back home.  Yup!  Being a new mom all over again after 14 years does some weird stuff to your brain!

When one of the waitresses saw me walking over towards the back, she asked me if I needed help and I told her I needed to find the bathroom to wash the baby's bottle and she told me she could take it to wash in the kitchen.  That was so sweet of her!

The food was still as delicious as I remembered from our first trip here back in 2014.  As much as I try to make my way over on every Vegas trip, it's hard when you travel with other people who don't share the same taste in food.

Most of the people buying work in the building so there are only two small tables.  I don't, but I was curious to see what was in there and saw a Korean fast food place which intrigued me.  They had bimibap, bento boxes, noodle bowls and sushi.  The sushi looked expensive (about $10 per roll), but everything else seemed reasonably priced.  I had a bento box, where you can get to choose your protein, get a side of rice and veggies and then get to choose two sides (sweet potato noodles, fruits, rolls, etc) and it was $10 before tax.  I think everything else was close to that as well. 

As for the quality of food, well the ingredients were definitely fresh and very well laid out.  The service was very friendly too.  However, overall taste was average, but if I worked in the building, I would go again. Actually, since I only live a 2 minute walk away and I'm feeling too lazy to cook and I'm working from home, I'd go.

It's set up in the same style as a Subway or Chipotle where you build your meal with the ingredients you want from meat to veggies to rice (white, brown or purple) and top it with the sauces of your choice.

I went with a purple rice, bulgogi beef bibimbap topped with everything including a fresh egg. It was super heavy in my hands but light on the stomach in the end (as well as the wallet - $8.50+tax). 

Best of all when you purchase 9 bibimbap's you get your 10th free! Really enjoyed this and it's definitely a great fresh healthy alternative to nearby food courts at SquareOne Mall.

I was disappointed with the service when we last went. We were the only ones in the restaurant and it took the waitress a solid 10 min before she even asked us for our drink orders. Then we were given the wrong order. Staff gave us extra food to make up for the error which was kind. Unsure why the service was so off when we were the only ones in store.

Beverage order taken immediately and almost as quickly wanted a food order...we weren't ready, wanted to catch up a bit first and browse the menu (many choices, things we didn't understand fully; thankful there were pictures and descriptions with most dishes). After we were given enough time we got our order taken...food came out in a very nice time frame. I ordered onion rings as the appetizer (would prefer smaller rings, but so crunchy and the spicy ketchup was great). I had the wrap, it was good...not spectacular, I should've ordered something more authentic. My co-worker order the seafood bibimbap...she ate all the goodies out of it and was taking home the rice for dinner =) it was so colorful and fresh looking!

Food: Outstanding! I ordered the chicken tenders. Half spicy and half Asian garlic (I think). The spicy is no joke. Different from a buffalo type spicy, this is like eating sweet fire. It burns but it burns so good. The garlic was the perfect remedy for the spicy. I would absolutely get this again! My wife got the bulgogi and loved it. Hefty portions and delicious tender meat. I will mention she grew up (until she was 9 years old) in Korea so the fact she loved her dish is saying something! Lastly, the potstickers as an appetizer were perfectly cooked and not soggy like some places. 

Service: This is what put it over the top for me. Dining with a newborn can be tricky but they were more than accommodating. Our waiter was fantastic. I'm not too critical of service but it's rare when I'm this surprised how well the service was! 

To be honest I debated on rating it 4 stars only because it was a little pricey but the exceptional service made up for it. Will return for sure!","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1

My whole family loves them and it's great how you can order a 10, 20, or 30 piece strip box to go.  Cook some rice and a vegetables at home and dinner is served.

For the price and convenient location, we'll go here over the best place for pork tacos (Seoul imo) all the time for a quick and casual dinner.  

This would be a perfect place to eat family style and try a little bit of everything.

I will return and try more dishes! Can't wait to try the wings!

Cons: the 2 person high tops are too close together. It makes me very uncomfortable being so close to another table. There is no privacy.

Chairs need to have sliders on the bottom as they are currently very loud when you move a chair.

I will order those again. The beef Korean tacos were delicious, but a little messy, so make sure you're not wearing your favorite dry clean only shirt. Edamame was perfectly steamed...

We came for lunch on a weekday, and only a few tables were filled. Service was average throughout. We decided to split the 10 piece wings (half spicy and half soy garlic) and the bibimbap with bulgogi (other choices are tofu and spicy chicken) amongst 2 people. The food came out pretty quickly. The fried chicken was very crispy, though more sauce/flavoring would help it out more. We were also given 4 drumsticks even though we ordered all wings. The bibimbap was a letdown, especially at almost $14. Maybe my expectations were too high but it was just a lot of white rice in a hot stone bowl topped with veggies that weren't especially outstanding. Not a large portion of meat either. So next time I'd stick with the fried chicken. I also wish the meal came with kimchi instead of requiring us to order it as a side item. The fried chicken does come with pickled radishes, which balance out the salty greasiness of the chicken nicely.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",0

I went for lunch and got the half and half combo. Half spicy/half soy garlic and half wings/drums. Chicken was crispy and juicy. It's a different kind of coating than you might expect. Almost cracker like and I'm thinking it was panko. 
That works well for me, but if you're expecting traditional coating you will be surprised and hopefully in a good way. Had no issues with service. My soda was refilled before it was empty and the food was brought out quickly and when hot. My side was kimchi and it was a good blend between crisp, spicy and refreshing. Next time I'll try the pickled radish and there will definitely be a next time!","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1
994,m-2KR6qlnAwsPiK9l2C6kw,Bonchon - Pineville,3.0,,"Came here a few days ago. Just to check this place out and compare to the Woodlawn location.  

1. The decor is a lot nicer than the one in Woodlawn. 4 stars

2. The food is not as good as the Woodlawn location. 3 stars. I ate the fried chicken. And tasted like it was deep fried too long. Very very crispy batter. Although the meat and nice and juicy. 

If I'm going for the food. I rather go to the Woodlawn location more in my opinion.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1
995,snnMolSauNKOzgZugorMLQ,Bonchon - Pineville,5.0,,I ordered food at 2:15 for delivery at 4:00 and was told that it would be 10 minutes late due to them not being able to find a driver. I called again at 4:03 and they said that the driver was on the way. I called the restaurant back and they had no updates on the delivery and explained that grub hub was responsible. I got an email from the driver at 4:23 and I called her and asked her where she was. She proceeded to lie and said that she called me and had already left my location. I was standing outside since 4:07 and did not see her or receive a phone call. I never received my food and I won't be ordering from them again. They need to fix their wonky partnership with grub hub for deliveries because it's obviously not working.,"['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",0

We had a great server who was very attentive.  We tried the spicy chicken wings, Kimchi, Korean tacos, and Bonchon wrap with soy garlic chicken.  Had plenty to bring home for left overs.  Everything we tried was excellent.  We will be back.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1

I cannot wait to go back here and eat that chicken again. The atmosphere was fine too. Cute place. That chicken though.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1
998,PUEsCiERrPn7rlqUzGgzgw,Bonchon - Pineville,2.0,,"Best chicken ever! I had been dying to try this chicken since I've lived in Illinois. So many people mukbang this place and it always appealed to me. I ordered the food through yelp and it came right on time. The food was hot and so flavorful. BF got the soy garlic & I tried the 1/2 Spicy & soy garlic. If you're sensitive to hear, please don't order the spicy.  It's banging! The radish is a must for the palette. Onion rings are huge and you get A LOT. So happy to have finally got a chance to try this place. I honestly think this is going to be my fave place to eat","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1
999,JgFqF4i6r-MvNWHHccKYbQ,Bonchon - Pineville,2.0,,"Server was attentive, food came out promptly. Spicy was decently apocy, put a tingle in my mouth. Did strips, fries and pot stickers.  Not as crispy as I would have expected for Korean fried chicken but not bad. Would come back.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1
