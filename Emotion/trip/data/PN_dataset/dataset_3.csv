0,"So people just go nuts for this place and I'm not entirely sure why. We tried this location out last night for a quick and easy Friday night dinner while we were out and about running errands. We got there before the crowd, and our overall impression was that the location is nice, but a little hidden, but that is no fault of the restaurant. 

All things considered, the food was pretty decent. We did not get the wings, as we are trying to be a little bit more healthy. We split the salmon stuffed avocado and it was actually pretty delicious. We also split an order of the Korean tacos. Here is where they lost stars. 

The service was horrible. They had one girl sitting at the front door on her phone pretty much the whole time. Two other ladies were servers, and seemed to hit every table but ours. Even as the restaurant filled up we still expected someone to come refill our water, ask us if we wanted another beer, or at least come take our plates away when we were done and ready for our check. When we ordered the avocado, we asked for cucumbers asked for them on the side and the waitress said that wasn't able- which may be able but she could have also just asked quickly. We ordered anyway and my husband just picked out the cucumbers and put them on my plate. When the tacos out, I waved the waitress for an extra of a spicy mayo and it took her over 5 min to bring it over. Again, we were able to look over that, but we had to have another waitress take away our plates after 10 minutes with no service. We when she did come clear the plates we asked for our check and she said sure I'll take it care for you. And then proceed to completely forget she had any recollection she spoke with us. Meanwhile our original waitress never came to check in on us despite now having nothing left on our table. My husband finally gave up and went to the bar and just asked for a check. 

I hate writing poor reviews, and I really do like Bonchon's food. But the service definitely tempered our experience given that we spent more time at the table after we ate than it took to get actually eat. I hope they start getting it right!",0
1,Always part of our itinerary whenever in KR. tip: always get additional cheese for a truly unforgettable experience,1
2,Very disappointed. Went there on a Saturday night. They said the were down 2 chefs. It took 20 mins to get thru the food line then 35 mins for our food to come out. The food was hot so that's why I gave a 1 star. I'll never visit this place again. I'd rather go to YCs,0
3,I just had a horrible experience at Genghis Grill I was there with a friend she ordered a burger with bacon on it it came out the bacon with majorly undercooked they said they would bring her some crispy bacon when the bacon arrived it was still undercooked. I'm saying is if they're under cooking their food someone could get sick. I ordered pot stickers that were cold when they came out an undercooked too.:(:(:( We did make the management aware but this situation still ended up unresolved . I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.,0
4,"Absolutely great place for a good pint and a really good burger, especially for western flight crews overnighting in ICN.

The best part is that if you're the lucky one who enters the place and happens to be airline employee #100, your bill is free. You just won't know it until it's time to pay the bill.",1
5,Korean food seems to becoming more and more fashionable these days. I especially like how there are so many vegetarian/vegan options on offer at this restaurant and it was very clean and comfortable. The toilets are fun - a cat meows whenever you open the door! This type of quirkiness is what makes South East Asia so fascinating. My tofu was fantastic and just spicy enough. Staff were so cute and smiley too. We were the only white people in there which is a testament to how authentic this place is. We would definitely return the next time we are in Birmingham especially as the Hippodrome theatre is down the road.,1
6,"We had dinner here on a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was not busy - 4 other tables occupied. It took 10  minutes to get a menu, another 10 minutes to finally get a hold of someone to take our order and another 20 minutes to get our food. 

What you need to know: 
-Do NOT order the dumplings - they tasted of freezer burn and were plated on stale cabbage. Pretty sure they have been sitting in the freezer for months.
-The restaurant was dirty. There were so many flies & fruitflies landing in our food. 
-If you do decide to try this place out, sit near the back of the restaurant where you will receive more attention from the staff and can avoid all the bugs flying into the restaurant (they leave the front door open). 

I will definitely not be returning to this location.",0

We went to miss Korea in Birmingham, for the first time to see what Korean food was really like. We ordered a range of starters and main courses which included bbq beef marinaded in beer which you was have to grill yourself. Also thier was raw beef bin bargan which tasted lovely. The selection of starters and mains were excellent. The service was good. Food came to moderate timings, the drinks were lovely and light, I went for Korean crushed pear drink which tasted excellent and fizzy. The atmosphere was comfortable.",1
8,"We came for dinner on New Year's Eve - around 6 pm. Easily found a table. We ordered 2 of the chicken fried rice. I didn't want anything spicy and this wasn't. Each person has to order 1 order so we ordered 2 orders of this for 6,000 won each.

Someone cooks the food for you and you can get some pickles, kimchi and salad yourself.

The staff isn't overly friendly but for the price, we didn't expect too much. Food was hot and good. It's more like korean fast food.",1
9,"I was excited to try this place for the Korean BBQ having wandered past a few weeks before. The welcome we received should have given some warning signs of the experience we’d receive - on arrival it took five minutes for the staff to acknowledge us. At which point we were asked to wait for a table. This was fine - however we then sat for 30 minutes before being shown to a table which was vacant when we had arrived half an hour prior.

We’d browsed the menu whilst waiting so were ready to order, but had to wait another 20 minutes to place our order - successive staff members telling us there was only one member of staff ‘who could take orders’. Whilst ordering we were then informed that the restaurant was cash only, so I had to wander to the local Tesco to get enough cash to cover the meal. A 20 minute wait at a busy cashpoint was not ideal but made little difference as our food took a good 45 minutes to arrive anyway.

I love a seafood pajeon (pancake) - this was the first of our order served, the Miss Korea version was unusually heavy and relatively tasteless. A disappointing start. Our bbq options then arrived - this was better, a good portion of pork belly which we struggled to finish. The experience however was affected again by the service. A surly member of staff repeatedly messing with the temperature controls without explanation and removing all food on the bbq to a plate again without explanation (it turns out to replace the grease proof paper on the grill). We also had to ask at least five times to have a glass of tap water delivered to the table - it eventually arriving at the end of the meal.

Overall a very disappointing experience, I don’t think we’ll be back - the food a pale imitation of decent Korean cuisine and some of the worst service I’ve received for a while.",0
10,It was not the best Korean food I had but I would go back. Place was busy. People without reservations were turned away. I got lucky because I was dining alone. Service was good.,1
11,Worth a visit..not amazing but good for sure. We came by for a late lunch and the place was empty. Service is not bad but you'd think with 4 people in the whole place it'd be superb. We ordered a combination of the sweet and the soy garlic and both were crispy and tasty. We also order bulgogi which was not great...very bland and at best just ok. Go for the fried chicken.,0
12,"In a nutshell:

Food and soups were all plain and bland.
Staff were not the friendliest.
Restaurant suits couples and large groups, I would encourage a family dining here.
Ventilation is a major issue in that place.
Price is not relative to the food quality nor dining experience.

Very disappointed and will probably stick to Topokki, that's just round the corner on Hurst St (check out my review on them too).

Wouldn't recommend at all.",0
13,"The contributors got it right with this place. Humble, cozy, friendly, ABSOLUTELY worth the visit. Don't expect a menu, it is tasty finger food. Excellent, creative drinks. We took a taxi there and the taxi driver spoke to the owner for directions. I never expected the Irish Owner to speak perfect Korean, but apparently he does. And then, get this, he waited outside for our taxi to arrive. Could he be nicer? NO. Could he have made a more inviting place for visitors to grab a drink and have a chat? No. Warren, you are a rock star and your bar is deserving of every 5 star review it gets. Like we told you that night -- we want to franchise you!",1
14,"Staff are really helpful, large selection of dishes, food was good but not excellent in my opinion. I enjoyed side dishes and accompaniments better than main ones",0
15,"Since this is Montreal, I didn't have high expectations for Korean bbq, but I wanted to give this place a try cus my friends here were so curious about it. The marinade was definitely not Korean....more like Chinese diluted to adhere to the typical sweetness of western food. It tasted cheap. I advise people to get drunk so you can forget about the bland taste and just keep eating. As I looked around, I felt bad for the people who are eating this, thinking this is actually Korean. I gave it one more star only because the price is relatively cheap: but remember that you get what you pay for.",0
16,"Great pub atmosphere. Warren is very friendly and really appreciates his customers. Thanks for the Rugby lesson. Nice relaxing time away from a hotel and the fish and chips were excellent. Really enjoyed the ""Cinder sauce"". Will be back.",1
17,Real korean food and from start to end great experience. Love it. Absolutely 5 star. For 30 pounds we had loads of food and a great experience!,1
18,"Something different from the usual UK style restaurants. Was an excellent visit. Meat was very delicious, my compliments to the chef..Me. sauces for dipping were tasty. Prices were reasonable. Would visit again. Side note, while the restaurant is wheelchair accessible the toilets are not.",1
19,"Perfect Atmosphere, Food, and Exceptional Customer Service! Terrific bar menu, beer selection, cocktails etc. Great Place!",1
20,"I went there with my friend on friday night. Not busy much that time. No greeting at the entrance. But i can accept that. As soon as we sat down, the waitress came and lay out the cutlery. My phone was on the table & she just pushed the phone away to put the napkin on the table. I was really surprised by her attitude and she noticed that too. But NO APOLOGY. Not at all !!
(Hint: dont know her name. But there's only one girl with the band hair in front, wearing gold necklace)",0
21,"The place is so small and they only accepted people with reservation in advance for dinner. This is our second time in this restaurant and we have noticed they getting busy or more hectic. Many people come and refused as they not making reservation even only 1-2 person. The food was the same, the Fish soup with red chili broth was great and tasty. The kimchi soup with Tuna also very delicious but the Bibimbap a little-bit boring, too dry and no have a good taste of sesame paste as in Seoul or any city in Korea. The free appetizers is always generous portions like in many Korean style restaurant. The high light was the Cinnamon drink, a little bit too sweet for western tongue but compliment the spiciness of Korean chili paste on the dish. The staff is friendly and seem so busy as she is alone serving so many guests.",0
22,Go for the food.  If you expect good ambience you will be disappointed.  It's a small restaurant and can get crowded so get there early or you will probably wait outside in line.  Food is good but don't expect it to be great like the ones in OC (CA) or LA.,0
23,"Si j'avais 횪 r챕sumer le Seoul Chako en un seul mot, je choisirais celui-l횪 : Gargantuesque. 
 
L'endroit est un BBQ cor챕en avec service 횪 volont챕. Ce qui veut dire qu'on fait cuire les aliments soi-m챗me sur un gril install챕 au centre de la table. Le tout est aliment챕 par un flot pratiquement ininterrompu de b흹uf, de saumon, de calmar, de porc marin챕 et/ou de crevette servis (d챕vers챕?) 횪 votre table selon la quantit챕 demand챕e. Voici donc l'endroit de pr챕dilection dans le centre-ville pour les gros app챕tits.

Dans l'ensemble, les aliments sont offerts dans une assez grande diversit챕 et dans une fraicheur tr챔s correcte. Certaines aliments sont marin챕es, d'autres, tel que le saumon ou le calmar, sont servis tel quel. Pour ma part, j'aimerais voir au menu beaucoup plus de type de marinade. Apr챔s tout, il s'agit de l'une des forces de la cuisine Cor챕enne, non ? 

Points forts : La quantit챕, la quantit챕, la quantit챕. La c척te de b흹uf marin챕e est excellente. Le concept est relativement unique que l'on ne voit jamais ailleurs dans les restos canadiens. 

Les points n챕gatifs : Le service est parfois d챕sorganis챕. Les soirs de fin de semaine, attendez 횪 faire la file. La prise de r챕servation semble relativement chaotique car j'ai souvent vu des clients argument챕 avec le placier les soirs de grande affluence. Le choix de viande marin챕e est assez limit챕. Pas de Soju disponible (c'est un resto Cor챕en, non???). L'ambiance rappel un peu les restos fast-food. Surtout, on 챕vite la pour un rendez-vous romantique. 

Somme-toute, c'est une assez bonne exp챕rience culinaire ax챕 sur la quantit챕, voir sur les exc챔s de table. On vient surtout ici avec son groupe d'ami affam챕 par une froide soir챕e d'hiver pour se goinfrer, s'empiffrer et prendre quelques livres.",0
24,"My wife and I used to come here and loved it. But over time, it's had a steady decline. While they have improved the decor, the food is not what it used to be. The past three times we have gone, the meat seemed to be substandard, looking pale, old or outright spoiled. Toady we walked in to the smell or spoiled chicken. Against our better judgement we stayed.  The sirloin looked oxidized, brown and as it had been out since yesterday.  And to top it off, they have turned up the grill high so they could cook faster. This lead to burnt food that was either overlooked on one plate and undercooked on another.

We're disappoint because we used to love this place. Not so much anymore. We probably won't be back and can't recommend it.",0
25,"This was one of the highly recommended food in many blog, but after trying various other types of Korean food, this one pale compared in terms of authenticity and taste to me. If you run out of ideals and this is near by, can consider for eat-to-live.

What I didn’t like about such restaurant is that you have to order the same kind of food for 2 persons because they cannot fry different meal/flavor on the same hot top.",1
26,I went here a couple days ago and I was excited because I was told it's amazing. I ordered bibimbap and the clear noodles (forgot what it's called but that was all I enjoyed). The bibimbap was extremely disappointing. I've eaten Korean dishes since I was a child and I've eaten bibimbap in South Korea as well. You are supposed to have either Korean rice or Japanese rice but they used the cheap Chinese long grain rice. It killed the entire meal. I wanted to impress my mother and take her out to eat but she didn't even enjoy it so it wasn't even worth it. And one of their employees were very rude and service was extremely slow. Maybe they're specialty is wings but if you're going to be a Korean restaurant and have other menu options. Make sure the other menu options are good as well.,0
27,"Not everything mix with Korean spicy sauce is Bibimbap, rice, meat mix with raw vegetables (salad).

I wonder if the owner or the chef ever tried or seen Korean Bibimbap or not... Lol

Okay, restaurant environment was nice, service okay, at least already better than other restaurants, can't expect much of Prague service.",0
28,"Before leaving NZ to live in Songdo, South Korea, I checked out the important things to me squash, golf and a good bar. Squash is virtually non existent, golf is too expensive, but the Cinder Bar , oh the Cinder Bar. From the first moment I entered the doors of this small bar, I realised it had a huge heart. The guy who runs it tirelessly is Warren, a guy who remembers everyone’s names. The beer selection is amazing ... 12 on tap and at least 12 different bottled ales. The food is simple , but wholesome and tasty. Do not visit Songdo, without checking the Cinder Bar out.",1
29,"The staff were wonderful, helping us to be comfortable with our first Korean BBQ experience. The food was excellent, fresh, tasty and awesomely different. Really a great place.",1
30,"The good reviews brought me to this place but I didn't get it. The table top experience was interesting, they place a pile of raw food in a pan on a cooker and come by occasionally to stir it for you. Why not just cook it in the kitchen? 

The taste of the food was at least 3 stars, it loses a star because of the small portions (no one should leave a restaurant hungry), and because I literally had to wash all my clothes the next day to get rid of the heavy onion smell (likely from all the cooking around you).",0
31,Kanpunygi(spicy chicken) was awful. The sauce was fine but the meat was very low quality. Staff were very friendly so I'm giving 1 star.,0
32,"Pros: Delicious foods for reasonable prices.

We order the pork tacos, pork slider and avocado salmon ball. All met our expectations. 

My favorite dish was the avocado salmon ball. It's a little small so you may want an appetizer to go with it. The taste was spot-on. 

For the price and convenient location, we'll go here over the best place for pork tacos (Seoul imo) all the time for a quick and casual dinner.  

This would be a perfect place to eat family style and try a little bit of everything.

I will return and try more dishes! Can't wait to try the wings!

Cons: the 2 person high tops are too close together. It makes me very uncomfortable being so close to another table. There is no privacy.

Chairs need to have sliders on the bottom as they are currently very loud when you move a chair.

The tv screens really don't add anything to the decor... but if you want to watch the game, they have lots of tvs. Personally, I think they cheapen the atmosphere.",0
33,"The owner is incredibly sweet and caring. You can see it in how he talks to his guests and how he cares deeply about his business and the community of Songdo. I was studying abroad in Songdo for about a year, and I can easily say that going to The Cinder Bar made me feel right at home and also very welcomed in a country/place that I was new to. Warren is not only kind, but also innovative. The food is delicious. I can't get enough of the fry dip! And he always had a new drink recommendation for me and my friends that we always loved! He is always reaching higher and making The Cinder Bar a fun, exciting, and comfortable place to meet up with friends and enjoy the night. Highly Recommend! Definitely swing by!",1
34,"This bar came highly recommended from a workmate of mine so all my workmates were keen to see if it lived up to it's expectations .I can say without a shadow of a doubt it is a fantastic little place . The owner Warren is the consummate host, he delights in serving some fine local and imported craft beers and makes wicked cocktails ( thanks for the hangover )
Looking forward to popping back to Cinders in Songdo to catch up with Warren not looking forward to the hangover .. 5 stars ..",1
35,"The place is very warm and welcoming, and also the staff tried their best to make us feel at home. They answered our questions regarding the food perfectly to help us decide, and the food ended up being quite affordable and very tasty! We had some Feuerfleisch, which apparently it's the national dish in South Korea, and some pork and squid, all of them incredible!

Pro tip: don't miss out on the sake, it was cheap and exceptional!",1
36,"I went with a group of friends and I ordered the pork belly ramen and it was not very good. The portion was extremely small and there was basically no pork belly in my bowl. The broth had no flavour and was under seasoned which was a big let down as it was $12.95. My friend ordered the simple ramen with an egg, and got shin ramen. The broth and noodles was exactly alike to the instant noodle brand shin ramen. Also service was not very good as we had to ask for the bill 4 times before receiving it on a tame night. Would not recommend.",0
37,"Lots of options in the area, interesting place, where you can cook your own meat under the barbeque section. I tried the beef which comes raw in a hot pot, you stir it and the more you do the more the beef gets cooked in the heat. Something different to what I've had anywhere before, the food was decent, I tried the eel also which was tasty.",1
38,We arrived early but still had to wait about 20 mins for a table since it's quite a small restaurant. The food was slightly too salty but the bibimbap was tasty as a whole.,0
39,"There's something magical about their beef brisket soup. It's so plain and simple, basically just meat and noodles in broth, but always hits the spot once you add in the flake salt and chili paste! I also include a generous heap of green onion with mine. You get this little dish of vinegar sauce to dip your meat in, which adds to the taste as well. And with most Korean food, it comes with a bowl of rice.

The banchan includes only three items: green peppers with bean paste, radish kimchi, and cabbage kimchi. Just forget everything but the cabbage kimchi because it is literally the best kimchi I have ever had in Las Vegas. The flavor is so on point! It's never over-fermented either, which I hate. 

The price is a little steep (~$15) considering it's a very simple soup and you have to do some work yourself, so I don't come here too often. But when the craving hits, it hits hard! E-Jo will always have a special place in my heart...Err, stomach.

The place could be a little cleaner...",0
40,Frequent this unique place... tasty north korean food accompanied by the performance of waitresses... a musical dinner.. a must to visit...,1
41,"I took my family last Friday evening for my anniversary meal - something different I thought because we always go to Cafe Soya which I must say is excellent. All started off well, waitress was friendly & explained the different meals. We ordered & then we waited 35 minutes for drinks & then our meals came 1 after the other - my wife's first after 50 minutes them mine 10 minutes later & my children then waited a further 10 minutes for their meals. It's not as if we ordered anything out of the ordinary. It's was very annoying knowing my children were hungry & me & my wife had our meals eventually but they still hadn't had theirs. The waitress said there was a mix up with the order which I couldn't understand because everything was from their menu & numbered. How easy could it be - the place wasn't busy so there was no excuse at all & the apologising during our meal got very irritating - too cap it off the waitress apologised again & then said they wouldn't charge the 10 % service charge. We couldn't wait too get out of there & would never return - the food is okay, the portions are mediocre & the prices are expensive for what it is but I will emphasise I will keep to what I know & stick ' Cafe Soya' in the future",0
42,"The service is one of the worse. I even questioned myself what had I done to make the waitress treat my table with so much hatred, but I guess she did that to every customer. She didnot say a word or understand anything we asked. She gave us cold stares. The food is no where compare to Toppoki, the other korean restaurant. I think because the chefs are not koreans. My friends live near the restaurant, its the only reason we came there so often. The size was small, pricey and not authentic. The best dish is bibimbap, that is the only compliment I can give",0
43,A friend recommended this place. We came here and ordered a few classic and popular Korean items but all are mediocre. Kind of disappointed. Especially considering the location and price.,0
44,"Reception was okay and they were very helpful. Not sure if this was because it was a Sunday but I am old and experienced enough to know my good was heated and not cooked fresh. My husband had a bibimbap which looked fresh and maybe should have ordered that.
Was recommended miss Korea by a colleague and this place is nothing to write home about. Sorry!",0
45,"Loved the experience of the Korean BBQ, loved the food and vibe, staff were very helpful and bill was very reasonable. Top marks!!",1
46,Food is decent and fun to cook on the bbq. Really good value and service was great. Not blown away by the food but would definitely return,1
47,"I was at a conference in Korea earlier this month and I was invited to this bar because one of the guys playing in the band was also at our conference. With other people from the conference, we went there and I had a great time. The music was great, the drinks were great and the vibe there was very chill and positive. Warren, who I think is the owner, was talking to us and making conversations with us and made us feel like we had been there before. If I ever go back to Korea, I'd definitely go there again.",1
48,"We heard that this would be a good place to eat because of the food but we sorely regretted coming here because of the horrible service. After we sat down, our waitress was rude and had attitude with us, likely because she did not speak much English. She even gave us looks while we were ordering because she had a difficult time understanding. Because she had a difficult time understanding, she placed the wrong order without even checking with us and then telling us that we can't change it because it has already been placed. After that, she did not try to check in with us and another server had to help us with the food. We never saw the waitress again during our meal. The table next to us were also tourists and we could tell they had some confusion with what they ordered and their waiter was impatient with them and rudely asked a server to deal with them. I would think because this location is in a tourist district that they would cater to tourists but they really fail with that. It seems to be always busy despite the poor service, probably because of its prime location. Will not be visiting again or recommending it to others. The food was okay despite not what we wanted to order.",0
49,Delicious food and even better service! I sat at Jesse's bar and had an amazing experience. Thank you genghis grill!!!!,0
50,"Caveat: I haven't ordered any of the two-person dishes, like the dak galbi. Those could very well be amazing.

Other than that, this place is solid but not notable in any way. The location is very convenient, the banchan are pretty good (love the radish and potato salad here), and the food is served hot and quickly. Everything is good, but it's pretty standard and I wouldn't say anything warrants more than a 3-star review. I think there are better places in the area (Huh Ga Ne, Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu) but this is not a bad option at all.

Cash and debit only.",0
51,"This Korean BBQ restaurant has excellent food, and attentive servers. Very busy so reservations might be a good idea.",1
52,"Very disappointing.
We arrived Sunday late afternoon, the staff could not have been more disinterested. Despite only a few tables occupied the waitress was more interested in talking to other staff members than take our order.
The restaurant was physically cold. A couple at the next table had to put on their outdoor coats after ordering.
The (electric) grill took an age to warm up, and when the food arrived (full meat platter) half of it was still frozen, obviously previously band saw freezer cut -- no marinade. For a restaurant that claims to be a barbaque, the meat was given shockingly no thought, oddly butchered cuts that could not be cooked without undercooking one half or overcooking the other.

Service continued to be at best minimal. The grill was occasionally manned by a member of staff (taking away the one gimmick the style of cuisine has) who left without any word. When we took to cooking our own cuts of meat, we were sternly told on how to operate the grill as we obviously missed the 12 week preparatory course for dining.

We left with most of the meal uneaten- the waitress did not ask why or if the meal was saitisfactory. I'd like to personally apologise for interrupting her 8 hour paid social club.

If the idea of being exposed to cooking yourself is some kind of wild evening entertainment and you don't mind that there are far better places to actually eat, I'd highly recommend ""Korean BBQ"".",1
53,"If you are homesick as an ex pat then this is the bar for you meet up your buddies or even Korean friends. It’s lively friendly and good priced with great selection of local
Microbrews as well as international
Favorites.",1
54,"No lunch buffet and the sushi bar is closed. Limited lunch menu but good prices. Place had a slightly odd smell. Practically empty for lunch. Menu could use some more English to explain what each item is.

Ordered a lunch bento. Food was bland and salad was just plain lettuce, no dressing. Won't be back.",0
55,"Wasn’t quite sure what to expect when I was walking in. However, the food was amazing. If I dad a friend that was Korean, and they took me to their mums house. I would expect it might be like this. Pure comfort food.",0
56,"I went here with my daughter and two of her friends from University In California. Anna who is from South Korea did the honours and ordered for all of us.

Great ribeye, short rib and marinated fillet. Accompanying pickled veg was excellent. Lots of soft fluffy rice. The chilli paste was very tasty as well.

If you like Korean and you love BBQ beef then give it a go. Value for money for four people.",1
57,Just such nice people even let us stay a bit long but just the nicest people and the nicest place! Don't rush your meal enjoy the place and the people! Even taught us how to cook the food to perfection! Deffo go again!,1

59,Worst service ever. Took long for servers to take orders. Waiters were not attentive. Glasses were empty. No one even paid attention. And difficult to flag anyone down to get a refill. Waiter used his hands to fill glass with ice and when an ice cube fell on the counter he picked it right back up and placed it in a cup. Many items that were ordered weren't brought to the table. They even ran out of food. How do you even run out of chicken?? You're a restaurant that is all you can eat. Beware they tacked on a 15% service charge for their LACK of service. And we were not a group.,0
60,"I used to love this place but I've had two bad visits in a row so I'm done. Yesterday 2 out of the 4 people at my table got the wrong starch, one had a very long delay because they'd somehow lost his bowl, another had totally raw egg in their bowl and we all had trouble getting drinks refilled. The prior visit my husbands bowl was served to the table next to us but the gentleman recognized that it wasn't his and sent it away. It was eventually served to my husband although they did offer to let him make a new bowl. Honestly, no one wants to start over when everyone else at the table has their meal. It seems like once they upgraded the decor everything else went downhill. Nothing is quite as clean and tidy as it used to be and the ingredients aren't as fresh. I also was bothered to see the busser wiping chairs and tables with the same towel but I see that at a lot of places...yuck!",0
61,"Amazing Korean food, I am addicted to the Pork Bulgogi. But all the food is very fresh and very authentic.",1
62,"I was craving Korean food and didn't want to travel far so my friends and I decided to give this place a try. 
The menu is pretty limited. The couple next to us ordered bibimbap and it looked really good so we decided to try it as well. The food came out sizzling and there was a side of soup included with the order. 
The food was pretty good and portions are big but I still feel it's on the pricier side. This place also didn't provide side dishes like how other Korean restaurants would. 
Overall, if I was craving Korean food and couldn't travel far, then I would come here again. Otherwise it wouldn't be my first choice.",0
63,"PSA, they will only acknowledge you if you are Korean!!! We came here on a rather slow Monday afternoon. There were only 3 small parties already seated in the restaurant prior to us getting there. One lady saw us standing  near the door and told us to sit anywhere. And that was the last time anyone made eye contact with us.

A waitress kept serving the table right next to us and never welcomed us, nor gave us a menu or waters. Mind you we waited patiently for 30 minutes for some type of acknowledgement. She even started cleaning off a table as she continued to ignore us. Needless to say we will never return to this restaurant.",0
64,went on a saturday night with some friends. Comfortable interior. Owner was very friendly and chatted with us how he came to make his beer selections. He has a very nice selection of beers. The best I have seen in Korea up to this point. The food we had was very good. I will return.,1
65,"Not good, Terrible experience. No Help from a stupid waitresses for complex menu! Need to send them back for training for a a good customer service.
Not Again!!! Its a waste of time and Money!",0
66,"Enjoyed our first Korean barbecue experience in this good value restaurant. It was quiet on a Tuesday night with only a couple of other tables occupied. Found the menu a bit confusing as a first-timer and should have chosen more salads/veg to go with the huge plate of meat we ordered to cook at the table, but the staff were reasonably attentive, refilling our glasses and swapping out the cooking plates regularly. A fun experience in a cosy local restaurant.",1
67,"With only one review for this restaurant (and a bad one at that), I didn't have high hopes. But, my wife really wanted to have some Korean food before a concert (Symphony Hall, a 10min drive away). So, this is the only Korean restaurant we could find in Birmingham.

It has a car park directly opposite. The restaurant is on the edge of China Town, and looks ok from the outside. On entry, its clean and tidy, nothing glamourous but pleasant. The menu is very Korean I think, although I think some of the staff were Chinese (not surprising in China Town). The menu had a heavy BBQ component, with the option to have BBQ bucket on your table to cook the food, or pre cooked by the chef. We opted for the later, as had limited time.

There were also the famous spicy cabbage dishes and soups. A good idea was to have option of jugs for juice/drinks, at reduced cost, which is good especially if your driving...plenty of juices to chose from too.

The food was fresh, plentiful, good value and really tasty. Lamb skewers went down a treat, as did the beef in beer and sliced pork dishes.

The only thing I could fault was no hand drier in the small gents toilet. Waitress was friendly, polite and attentive.

Would go again, its a really good addition to the cuisine availble in Birmingham China Town.",1
68,"KGH is a good place to eat if: 1) Authenticity is not a concern 2) You want great prices 3) You want AYCE BBQ. 

First of all, it's Chinese owned. If you have Korean friends, they can quickly point out all the ways that the food and style is not authentic. But who cares, it's BBQ meat! It's always good! They are Chinese so as expected, service isn't that good. 

Second of all, I come here for the value. It's cheaper than AYCE sushi. Every once in a while, you just want to stuff yourself with meat. This is one of the best places to do it because you can hang out with your friends or family while cooking together. 

Thirdly, a lot of Korean places don't do AYCE. Some do, but they usually have restrictions like you only have 1 type of meat. KGH gives you several choices of meat/seafood. 

I'd say the quality of meat you get is generally worse than what you get at Korean places. But that's more than made up with quantity. The seasoning is slightly off. Also, the side dishes are definitely way off the mark. But you didn't come here for the side dishes. You came here for mountains of meat. Get ready to feel meat sweats after eating here. And make sure you don't wear nice clothes. You'll smell like BBQ after and want a shower.",0
69,"Recommended to try for Korean taste. Good place, nice food, clean environment and friendly staff.. Worth to try,",1
70,"The person who love with alcohol ... this Is the place for foreigners in Incheon. Quite reliable on quality and brands, somehow manageable pricing, no language barrier .... all bartenders can communicate and speak well in English. Interested one, shall try it.",1
71,"Loved this bar served by his owner. Ex-pat hang out with good music, good finger food, and a variety of beers and whiskey. Good vibes all over.",1
72,"First to start off, I got myself a Yelp account just to leave my opinion on this place. 

I've been coming to this location for almost 20 years and have always love it. The food WAS great, and the staff were friendly. 

Lately, within the last 3 months, their food has been overly salty. First,  their signature sweet soy sauce (the ones they have in the bottles on the tables) went from great to concentrated salt water. No sweetness left...

Then their meat marinate started to get salty as well. I told one of the owners about it and they said they were aware and was gonna to fix it soon. 

Ok... Nothing improved for 2 months. 

Today,  my parents wanted to go their for lunch.  I ordered my usual. BBQ beef lunch box. SALTY,  EVERYTHING.  

SALTY BEEF, SALTY TOFU, SALTY RADISH, SALTY BEAN SPROUTS,  even the rice was SALTY. Everything tasted like a salt lick!  Yuck! 

I'm not returning to any of their locations till they get better cooks with proper tongues, or get rid of 3/4 of their salt use. 

Good bye Korean Grill House, so disappointed...",0
73,"This new restaurant provides to my mind authentic Korean flavours and dining experiences. I am no expert but have a little knowledge of Korean food having visited the country about 20 times. I was told that the chef is Korean and this was borne out in the flavours I enjoyed in my lunchtime Bulgogi Bibimpap a few days ago.

The melon juice was typical of the kinds of accompaniment one enjoys with Korean food, and the kimchee (pickled spicy cabbage) really did take me back to a country I have enjoyed visiting over many years.

The restaurant was very quiet when we viisted but this was just before the start of the university terms in Nottingham. Nottingham's 60,000 new and returning students (or at any rate some of them) no doubt will give the place a bit of atmosphere shortly.

There was only one (non-Korean) waitress serving when we visited, but this no doubt reflects the fact that we were there at lunchtime, at a quiet time of the week. I would say however that the confident manner in which Korean waiters and waitresses serve and talk about the food it is their job to bring to you is another very nice aspect of restaurants in Korea. If this place can manage it it should hire some Korean waiting staff it would provide even more genuineness in the dining experience.

The only thing I really quibble however with is the name of the restaurant. Viewed either as referring to a yearning for visiting Korea or to a beauty pageant, it is slightly cheesy. Something that speaks to you of Korea's ancient culture in my view would be more appropriate. This is a small reservation about a generally good restaurant that I intend to visit again.",1
74,"Tourist trap. Rude staff, they just want you to eat and get out of their way. Food is just ok, no big deal. Very smoky, your clothes and hair will come out smelling like BBQ for days. And the smell of chilli is so strong that I couldn't stop coughing because of it.",0
75,Absolutely majestic experience - the staff were lovely and the food was equally outstanding. The cook-it-yourself factor significantly spiced up our dining experience and added a touch of fun to the table. Great place. 10/10 would recommend.,1
76,"This is a smaller restaurant a bit hidden by metal barriers. The food and service are great. We had Korean bbq, kimchi stew, and ramen. All were great and made me feel like I was back in Korea.",1
77,"Visited with fiancé, one of my friends recommended me this restaurant. I wanted to eat something authentic, and this place was indeed authentic. The restaurant itself is not too big, but looks cozy. We tried 2 different kind of ramens, some kimchi, and korean green tea latte. The drink was amazing, the food even better! Their tempura is so tasty, I keep telling my man to go back to get more.
I would definitely recommend!",1
78,"In a smaller street if Myeongdong, a restaurant on two floors soecialised in chicken grilled on the table",1
79,"This place serves the BEST fried rice ever!

Don't be fooled by the menu, just get the 2nd best at 6500Won per head (min 4) PLUS 4 servings mozzarella cheese.

You will thank me for this :)",1
80,"We ate in here for the 1st time on a Monday night. The restaurant was very busy and has a great ambiance. The servers were all friendly and the food is excellent. to start with we had the chicken Kangpopi, which was larger enough to have been a main course. The sauce was very good, not too spicy, but had enough flavour. For my main course, I had the Chicken katsu. Again this was very good, the chicken was well cooked and the curry sauce was great, the sticky rice was also brilliant. My wife had a beef dish. Which she enjoyed and was well cooked. This was my first visit to Miss Korea and will not be my last.
For a starter, 2 mains a soft drink and 1 glass of wine, the total was £34, which is excellent value.",1
81,Very uneven. Concept is interesting and BBQ is good. Sushi are tasteless at best as they have been made several hours before. Service is horrendous as most waiters seem not to care about customers.,0
82,"Small restaurant with close tables.
Menu ok but food disappointing.
Starter was ok. It the main course lukewarm and somewhat lacking.
Staff not that friendly.
Ice cream pretty good though.
Difficult to give a positive recommendation.",0
83,"AVOID IT!
We just randomly walked in, seeing many people there so we really thought this should be a good place for food. However, the food there made us soooo disappointed. We ordered four dishes and none of them tasted okay. The BBQ source was so weird and the beef was not fresh at all! As for the beef soup, I would say they destroyed every thing. It was so slight and there was not enough ingredients inside. All in all, I don’t recommend it. This restaurant is unqualified.",0
84,"Had an excellent BBQ here. The place is spacious and clean. It had a good buzzing atmosphere and service was excellent which makes such a difference. Staff were friendly, helpful explaining how the BBQ worked and they all looked like they wanted to be there. BBQ was excellent and very reasonably priced. You can get just pork or beef or a mixed one. We got the mixture of pork, beef, chicken and came with 2 beers for £38. The experience and the meat itself was fantastic especially the sauces and the pickled vegetables- the marinated chicken and beef bulgogi were devine. If you're on the Atkins diet no danger here as the meats and vegetables are plentiful with no carbs in sight

Would highly recommend",1
85,"Looked disappointing on arrival but inside was better.
Busy and a lovely atmosphere.
The food was lovely and very good service.",1
86,"Our first dakgalbi and we were not disappointed. It had the right amount of spice and the marinated chicken and octopus were yummy. We ordered fried rice and it was added in together with the chicken and octopus. Would have loved to add the cheese but I think it would have been too filling.

Best to eat with more people. I went with my 71 year old mom so we wanted to order just for one to share but that wasn’t allowed. In the end we almost managed to finish our food.

You could get as much from the salad bar.

If you can’t tolerate spice you might not enjoy this. Be warned though, after your food, your hair and clothes will smell of bbq.",1
87,"Went around 6pm with plenty of seating.  Service was great at first, server was attentive, brought us drinks and the meats fast.  Then died off later on when the restaurant got busy since there was 2 guys serving.  You get 2 sheets to fill out, i guess you can only order 2 times or something.

First time there, not a fan of korean bbq.  We had pork, pork sausage, beef ribs, chicken, salmon, fish fillet.  Basically we just grilled them and ate them.  Not much flavor but burnt bbq.

After about 1 hour and a half, server left us for dead, asked for tea, ice tea, multiple times, and never received it, guess they wanted us out.  When i asked for the bill, he was quick...

Overall I wouldn't return.  Sure it was a nice experience cooking your own food on a grill.  But there wasn't much flavor, and everything tasted burnt after a lot of meat.  There just wasn't any contrast or difference in flavors compared to other buffets.",0
88,"Yoogane was discussed in several blogs so I tried to give it a go. Personally, it was very smokey inside. My eyes can't handle any smoke, so I was eating with red eye and crying for the whole lunch because of it.
The food itself not bad. The cheese and noodle toppings will enhance your appetite.
The service was quite rude. This is what I actually experience in some places in korean. They tend to ignore you when they can't speak english. But hey, this is a restaurant and I'm sorry, I can't tolerate if you leave me when I am speaking and giving my food order to you, especially when you do it because you want to serve other table. My friends in fact need to calm me down so that I won't leave right in the middle of our lunch.

Perhaps I was too hungry so I easily got mad, but hate the service and that uncomfortable smokey place did not help. Will not come again, especially when the taste did not make up for the bad experience.",0
89,"Not impressed. Name of restaurant does not live up to what they serve.I don't think it's even Korean bbq .They marinate the meat in some simple way, a bit tasteless actually,  that is not typically Korean I find. Korean bbq marinated meat.... It's usually a bit sweet and packs a lot more flavor. The fried dumplings were actually quite terrible, the filling was mushy inside and had a bad texture. And the kimchi, well...I'm no kimchi expert, but it didn't taste very appetizing. It was not sour enough for my liking. Service was inconsistent. I was served by 6 or 7 different people. Dinner cost was overpriced. $21.99 for all you can eat. Plus was, meat seemed fresh, came in nice small portions. Service was also generally pleasant. Atmosphere was close to high-end, the walls changed colors....reminded me a bit of a club, Anyway I would not pay 21.99$ for this kind of food. I'd prefer to pay the lunch price which is 13.99$.",0
90,My husband and I lived in Korea for 3 years and crave good Korean food often. Korea House Restaurant did NOT disappoint! It was very authentic! We will go back as often as we can!,1
91,"me and my friends visited this restaurant last Friday , all of the dishes just taste like putting the spicy bean paste on it . would not recommend if you are really craving for 'real korean food' .",0
92,"This place is a gem in Boulder, that few know about. This place has amazing food. I love their Mandoo soup. I always get that or their spicy beef soup. The kimchi is fantastic and the rice cooked to perfection. It is a family owned place (one of the few remaining in Boulder) where the husband serves the food and his wife cooks. He is the most pleasant person you will ever meet. He pulls out your chair for you when seating and always is attentive, and comes quickly if you need something. The restaurant is very cute and I admire the way he decorates. It is a random assortment of stuff from all over the world. The restaurant is always clean as if he just opened. The food smells delicious from the back. I have become a regular because of his food and the family’s kindness. I was having a rough day once and he brought a mochi dessert, on the house. If you are looking for quality Korean food at a reasonable price, this is the place to come. He is always so grateful to all who come to eat at his restaurant. This place, is by far my favorite place to eat in Boulder and I was born and raised here. He will go to any length to make sure you enjoy your meal. You can also do take out, but I highly recommend you stay and enjoy his hospitality. He has Korean and other Asian beers as well as sake of different types. This restaurant is sadly, tucked away behind a gas station so it is not visible from 28th street. But once you know where it is. It is very convenient with tons of parking available. Great place to eat alone, with family or friends. I always walk out with a smile on my face and a warmth in my belly due to his wife’s amazing cooking. To the customer who said that he charged them 20% tip without them knowing, then he did not read his receipt or the menu. So please disregard that review as, the owner is the farthest thing from a con man. As noted with the dessert he so generously gave to me. I have a feeling the customer leaving the one star review, had a party of six or more and it is common practice at restaurants, to place a 20% gratuity charge on this many at one table. So next time you want a really good place to eat with great service stop in here. It is well worth it. I guarantee you won’t be disappointed.",1
93,We really enjoyed Miss Korea. The food was outstanding and I would recommend you to try this restaurant,1
94,"We visited at 11am for lunch on a weekday and we were seated right away. Waiter spoke some English, we ordered 2 of their ""best"" galbi dish without cheese ( we had to do 2 orders as per the waiter, we couldn't just order 1). It was very good, and cooked well by staff. I would recommend trying their food.",1
95,"Utterly unimpressed.
Although the price is cheap (6.75 for an entree), the content and quantity is abysmally small. I got the Spicy Pork stir fry with rice, and I ate all of it in 5 minutes and was dying for more food.  My friends' bibimbop and tofu pot had no beef, which was kinda ridiculous since the beef is supposed to be there. Perhaps if we had gotten the tabletop cooking the experience would have been different?

They are also stingy with their appetizer side dishes. Refuses to serve them until you get your meal and are reluctant to give you seconds.

Taste-wise they are definitely authentically Korean, just like the owners, who are super polite. 

I probably won't be back, since there are so many places around the area that are so much better.",0
96,"Called in here on a Monday night (5pm) when the doors open, we where in only 5mins and the place was full, so maybe book in advance, nice clean restaurant, had the house bbq that’s comes with a Korean beer included, good selection of meats and side plates",1
97,"If you don't mind propping up the North Korean regime then take a visit to Pyongyand, probably the closest to North Korea you will ever get. In line with other reviewers very bizarre to see the waitresses suddenly performing rousing songs on stage. Also had to chuckle when we saw stewed dog on the menu - no we did not order it!",1
98,"The contributors got it right with this place. Humble, cozy, friendly, ABSOLUTELY worth the visit. Don't expect a menu, it is tasty finger food. Excellent, creative drinks. We took a taxi there and the taxi driver spoke to the owner for directions. I never expected the Irish Owner to speak perfect Korean, but apparently he does. And then, get this, he waited outside for our taxi to arrive. Could he be nicer? NO. Could he have made a more inviting place for visitors to grab a drink and have a chat? No. Warren, you are a rock star and your bar is deserving of every 5 star review it gets. Like we told you that night -- we want to franchise you!",1
99,"Being a vegetarian, I was a bit sceptical about going to this place.And along with this I had never been to a Korean restaurant before. As soon as you enter, it smells so so good. Unfortunately very few vegetarian options and the 2 courses that I ordered were very ok for the price they were at. A special mention to the staff. They were so good. Great service, made us feel so comfortable and were always keeping a check in case we weren't sure about the BBQ. The chef had also come out once to check the bbq. My friend loved the food. But my food was ok and hence the 3 stars. Wish I could give more.",1
100,"This bar is newly opened and is an offshoot of another bar of the same name in Incheon City.
Very much nicer than all of the sterile airport hotel bars around this area. A lively welcome from Warren Kidd, the owner, who asks your name and introduces you to everyone in the bar. Makes for easy conversation and a friendly atmosphere.
The bar staff keep the party and conversation going by joining in - with a focus on encouraging the buying of rounds of drinks (""ring the bell and buy everyone in the bar a drink""!). Great for the profits, but also great for the atmosphere created. Genuinely enjoyable and a fun atmosphere.
I didn't have any of the food, but it looked like decent bar food (burgers etc).
A highly entertaining evening, marred slightly by the feeling that everyone was being pushed into drinking more. One of the best bars that I have visited.",1
101,"The Cinder Bar is a fantastic place to stop and make some new friends. Warren is the owner. Chances are he will personally greet you and make you feel like a long lost friend. The patrons are a great mix of local and westerners, very friendly. He has all the liquid refreshments you could hope for and a satisfying menu. I had a shrimp platter that was delicious. Aircrew are always welcome. Give it a try.",1
102,But the place dis not meet our expectations. The service was very slow and rather rude. They accept only cash. It was so cold inside the restaurant so we had to wear our jackets.,0
103,"I have been here four times. Twice for dine in and twice for carry out. I am not a Asian food aficionado, but the dishes I have had here have been very good. Even when I wasn't sure what I was ordering. I would definitely recommend the Kimchee Soup! It's great.",1
104,"Cinder Bar is one of the most hospitable bar/foreign bar I know in Incheon. It is located in the out skirt of Dream City, Incheon, near the bridge. Warren, the owner is kind, generous, respectful, and so are the rest of his crew. This is the first and only review I have written on my own for any travel site, and I will say this bar is a great place to make new and promising friends. You will get to meet some great people, many of whom are regulars there like myself... not saying I drink to often, but that I enjoyed hanging out with people from the bar. Not only is this bar a great meet up for old friends or new friends, but even other bar owners or restaurant come here to have a great time.",1
105,"Dreadful chinese. General tso was slimy, rice was underseasoned. Have renamed as Korean Wings.",0
106,Korean bbq is one of my favorite foods and while I don't live near Korea House this is where I go when I'm craving it. The wait staff is excellent and if you run out of sides they're more than happy to bring you more.,1
107,"it's a dalkalbi chained restaurant. You can find easily in some part of seoul.
Yummy food! the taste is the best.
Tips: save a bit of your chicken and order fried rice at the end. they will mix up the rice with the chicken and the leftover sauce. it is more delicious than the chicken itself!!
A must try",1
108,"Reservation man reject us because we have kids... what terrible services !!!... we angry and he keep reject us !!! He said no food for kids, find another restaurant...",0
109,"I am so glad i found it finally...after so long of searching for this korean resto. It is very authentic and brings you back to Seoul for their great dishes. It will not be called Amazing Chicken if you will not be amazed with the taste of their chicken dishes---the Yang Nyeom and Gan Jang or you can order it together! Superbly delicious!!! I cannot say more...you get to experience it and truly enjoy it. They offer you variety of complimentary appetizers and all the authentic korean dishes are there from the favorite japchae noodles to its bulgogi. Variety of soups such as kimchi, denjang and YukGaeJang will wake yourself up.

Highly Recommended for your dining experience.

110,This place destroyed my fondness for Korean food.,0
111,"It's 14.49 for a regular bowl the small bowl at 12.49 is too tiny for most 
 people,you pick out what you want in meat,veggies  and seasoning ,they fry it up,it's sort of a buffet line.It is okay but certainly not an inexpensive meal ,tasted okay but I see no reason to go back.They give you a choice of pasta or rice ,it will fill you up.Not for a tastes but it is worth giving it a try.",0
112,"Korean Grill House's night owl special (10PM to closing) gets you AYCE beef, pork, chicken, fish fillet, and squid along with unlimited refills of side dishes, steamed rice, and beef broth soup. The slices of beef and pork looked as if they were cut haphazardly as slices were either huge or miniscule. Everything was edible though I suggest you skip the soup. 

We were a group of five and arrived to an almost empty restaurant. The waiter brought us to the left side, where pillars sectioned tables into 4 persons per grill, and seated us so that we would have to share one grill. Our request to move to where 5 people could use two grills without anything hindering us was denied because they hadn't cleaned any of the tables or grills on the right side. It was odd but we weren't planning on making a big deal out of it. 

Last call was at around 1130PM. For the entirety of our time there, all the work staff were just gathered together and chit-chatting. That all changed once it hit midnight. Suddenly they were scurrying around, cleaning grills, clearing tables, moving carts to and fro. It felt like they were doing their best to pressure us to leave and the other two parties besides us looked as confused as we were. Closing time was at 1AM as listed on their website and on their door so why were they rushing us? Update your closing time or train your staff please.",0
113,"Excellent gin, kraken and cocktails. Good bar food too. I recommend the cinder shrimp. Wonderful company too. Warren and the team are great.",1
114,"Came here with a group on Friday night, and it was packed! Make sure you wear layers, because the place is hot + the food is hot. My friend and I shared the chicken and seafood dak gal bee with the Joon's original sauce and cheese. It was okay (I forgot to add in the rice cakes!). There's a minimum of two orders for that dish. Just a warning though: the prices do stack up because of the add-ons to the dak gal bee. But without some toppings, the plate can get bland. Other than that, all was good. Service was prompt. The restaurant has wooden tables, chairs, and booths. Noise level was very energetic.",0
115,"Writing this as the dakgalbi is cooking. Poor first impression, lousy service, forced ordering already gave a bad taste even before i bite into my first piece of chicken.

You'd rather go to a less popular dakgalbi restaurant than give your $ to a restaurant that thinks its too popular to forget about service quality and overall customer experience.",0
116,"From a Korean's perspective, I didn't find food at Miss Korea at all authentic or tasty. I could have made a better Bibimbap myself; Yuk-Kae-Jang tasted like mild beef stock; Kimchi-Jeon too sweet; Sam-Gyup-Sal tasted like cardboard.

I was surprised how Kimchi-Jeon and Hae-Mul-Pajeon were on desserts menu.... Just because the English translation is ""Kimchi pancakes"" and ""Seafood pancakes"" doesn't mean they are dessert material - far from it! The waiter who served me wasn't familiar with the menu, which made me having to point out the dishes one by one with my finger.

I was also appalled by how they refuse to serve tap water. Yes, bad for their profit - but shouldn't they still serve it if the customer wants it?",0
117,"This isn't the first time I ate at Joons, but it would definitely be my last. The only reason I still eat there despite its horrible service and selection of appetizer is because of their table cooking. I'll admit, I like their table cooking selections (I personally go for the chicken one) and along with that I always add a few side dishes to add to it. My typical selection is cheese, noodles x2 since we have two people and sweet potato. As usual, I ordered this except this time the waiter told me in half-understandable English that I can only order one noodle, even if I want to pay extra for it. Okay? So you don't want my money? And what kind of policy is it to not let customer order what they like? Fine, I got over that since it's not such a big deal. As usual, the appetizers did not come until nearly 20 minutes later. And no, asking them for it would not make it any faster. Infact, they had it on the counter all along but still didn't want to give it to you. I can confidently say this is their way of doing things because all four times I went, things never improved. The appetizers consist of: two pieces of broccoli, half a scoop of potato, some kimchi and a few beans. Every time I see it it just makes me not want to go back. Onto the horrendous main course that used to be good: Table Cooking. We decided to try something new today: Tofu Table Cooking. Everything seemed normal until we took a bite at the tofu, it was incredibly sour, not what a NON-EXPIRED tofu should taste like. YUCK! There is a saying that restaurants that are afraid of letting customers eat would not stay open for long, as they oppose the fundamentals of even opening a restaurant. DEFINITELY not recommended!",0
118,"Good food, with a menu of both japanese and korean dishes. The location is a little bit out of the way, but worth the trek for some quality bibimap!",1
119,"Friendly staff, good beer, wine and cocktail menu. Sport shown on the big telly (owned by a kiwi so good for rugby). Didn't eat so not sure about food,",1
120,"The best thing about this restaurant is the bbq at the table, it is worth a visit just for that reason as is unusually, food we orderd from the menu was ok lacked flavour certainly the soup. we felt other foods was slightly over priced for the lacking quality in the menu food, however the staff were friendly and the area was clean and tidy, not sure we would visit again.",1
121,"Horrible Soup
Just terribly Horrifying food
Their soup is Hot water with Rice... no taste

Tres tres sale, le plancher, les tables, douteux sur la vaisselle, les toilettes horrible et pour finir l'un des serveur passait la mope pendant que nous etions encore en train de manger...sans compter l'odeur de la mope. Cher pour ce que c'est. Bruyant a souhait mais dommage car le concept est sympa.",0
123,"I'll be honest. The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the waiter was nice and was trying his best.  The manager is really nice and gave us free things to make up for the service. Music was loud as was the group of teenagers next to us who were screaming and banging on the table. The meat was served extremely slow. We got our menus after being seated for 25 minutes, got our food after 40 minutes. Portion sizes are small, pork belly is cheap quality, marinated meats are okay. You have to pay an extra $3 per order for the classics and best cuts like galbi and ribeye. The small dishes are small and good for literally one bite. Not to mention the grills are not covered underneath and I actually got burnt multiple times because my legs are long. Would not come here again for at least a few months. Manna is your place to go. Meat is better, service better, and everything is served faster. I've never been so hungry at an ayce",0
124,"Fake korean restaurant running by Chinese. 
Kimchi stew was terrible. And every dish i had taste like chinese herb. If you expect authentic Korean food please aware this place.",0
125,Love Korean food and thus place is great. Small but good. Service sometimes changes and varies in quality but the food has always been good to great. Green tea ice cream a must!,1
126,The restaurant is nice and cozy. The food is delicious so far I liked everything that I have ordered. The staff are very polite and helpfull,1
127,"The beer is reasonably priced including a few New Zeeland made beers you can't get anywhere else in Songdo. If you are feeling hungry they offer a couple options including some killer wings that come with a their own unique 'Cinder Sauce'. The real highlight of Cinder Bar is the service, the owner Warren is there every night and he is by far the best bartender in Incheon, he is warm friendly, and never let's an empty glass sit. Despite being born in New Zeeland he has lived in Korea long enough to speak fluent Korean. Because of this the atmosphere is unique it's not just a 'foreigner bar', every member of the Cinder crew can speak English and Korean so both locals and foreigner mingle in roughly equal proportions.",1
128,"So let me put this out here first - I've eaten at a Bon Chon located near Park Road. It was great. That's why they get a star. This location however has garbage customer service and completely unprofessional. I walk in and the lady assumes I'm picking up an order. Guess cause I'm alone?? When I say I want to be seated she seemed overwhelmed.  I guess she was cause then sits me down and doesn't come back. Period. Meanwhile a young man come in, sit down ,  get asked for their drink order,  and have it. I can tell the waitresses are not on the same page while the ghost waitress gives appetizers to other waitress table. It's disorganized. You can feel the tension. When ANOTHER waitress finally makes it to me I'm over it. I told her no one has waited on me and asked is there a staff shortage. She proceeds to insult the other waitress Asian race and say there's a shortage  of brains.  I ask is it taking awhile for food to come out and she says yes. I then proceed to exit. No one even tried to apologize or anything.",0
129,"Not known by many due to its hidden location in Summerlin, this restaurant has a great Japanese chef that was recruited from Osaka and a Korean chef that was recruited from Shilla hotel in Korea. 
The Korean chef cuts the meat everyday only when ordered to be fresh, the Japanese chef cut a sashimi that was literally melting in the mouth. 
The interior design was done by a Korean architecture firm out of San Francisco and they have extremely unique vents and tables that were flown from Korea. 
Definitely try a Friday night since the last time I was there I saw Andre Agassi who is a huge fan of hers.",0
130,We queued for about 20 minutes or so. The meal was so so to me. I wouldn't bother to line up for this. There are much better options in Myeondong.,0
131,"Went to try this restaurant the very first time but they successfully made us not to return. The Cash Only restaurant which you will be told when you sit down and of course again and again afterward. It was quick when order the food but long waiting time after that - you need to be patience and not too hungry so keep chatting or bring a book. Food was a bit disappointed. Frozen meat was served for BBQ - maybe it is ok??

Vegetables were not fresh. Food portion is small. We ordered a Kimchi fire rice as we love kimchi but it was so hard to dig out some kimchi and can hardly see the pork. Service was awful - all waitresses may had a super hard day. One of them turned off our BBQ cooker suddenly without even said a word when we still have meats on there.

Not a good experience, very disappointed.",0
132,"First time here and it was okay. I ordered the half&half lunch wing combo special or so I thought. I was given a mix of wings and drummettes. Go figure?  The spicy flavor trumped soy& garlic, plus preferred the wing meat.  For my side I enjoyed the thick skinned French fries.  Lunch was good going down, but felt slightly ill afterwards.  Could have been all the spices or related to the strange smell of the place. Glad to see this was observed by another reviewer, plus does not help matters as it is  located next to a pet salon.... Toss up if I repeat visit.",0
133,"Good option of bar for the expat crowd. Nothing special, pleasing mostly foreigners. All kinds of drinks, expensive and very small place, but apparently the only option in town if you don't speak Korean.",1
134,"We really enjoyed our dinner here, The hostess/owner was great, we ordered the platter for two that included two beers, My wife does not drink beer, so it was a win win. The food was flavorful and fresh, and we had fun cooking it. Our server refilled the vegetable sides as needed . Well worth the money",1
135,"It was my second visit last night and was really impressed with the food taste, presentation and service. Being a native Asian, I am very picky when it comes to Asian food and in this part of the globe, it's very difficult to find an authentic Asian food. Taste of Korea - Amazing Chicken is one of the few authentic Asian cuisine restaurant in Muscat. Food was presented with attention to detail and the taste was really tempting that I over ate again. Will definitely come back to try other listing service in the menu.",1
136,I cannot speak to the food since we did not eat there but clearly they have a lots of problems with the operation of the restaurant. Long waits with tons of empty tables. We were told that we could sit at a table at the bar upstairs to drink but we had to wait for 45 minutes to eat when we were told it was 1st come 1st serve. Disorganized. Even the manager gave us the run around. We will not be returning.,0
137,"How the hell can you claim to have all you can eat sushi when you damn selection is only the 10 basic rolls you can get an any other sushi restaurant for nearly the same cost as buying them individually?

I really want to give this place 1 star but I'm pretty much ranting on the AYCE sushi aspect of this restaurant.  I only came here because it was the closest sushi place from my buddies house and to be honest, I was PUMPED to come here since I was starving for AYCE sushi and wanted to try some new stuff.

The building is aesthetically pleasing and it does have a warm/cozy feel to it.  But the service was lacking (mainly since the waitress seemed to forget that I existed). 

Anyways, I look at all the stuff on the menu then come to find out every single thing I planned on ordering from the AYCE sushi was not on the AYCE sushi menu.

Fuck.That.Noise

I have never been so tilted after eating sushi, it fucking defies the laws of physics.

138,"My friend visited from the USA, where there are many Korean BBQ places. She took me here to experience it and we were very happy. Food is good, very filling, and the staff are friendly. When we arrived we were told the small restaurant was full, but instead of just turning us away the staff took my contact number and called us when a table became free. A very nice idea, meaning we could explore a bit more!",1
139,"The food tastes terrible, the portion is super tiny, and the price is unreasonable. More importantly, the owner charged us 20% tips without our permission.",0
140,"Ignore the haters (lot of them their first review - seems a bit fishy to me...). After discovering Miss Korea on a whim with a friend last November we have been twice more. Everytime we have had no problem getting tap water, though usually alongside other drinks. The BBQ stuff is awesome, the beef with ginger and soy is great. The service is quiet and efficent, which is the way I personally like it. Miss Korea is one of my favourite spots to eat currently, don't see that changing anytime soon...",1
141,"Went here with a friend. My tab was $18 hers was $29.

So, we split the tab and he has me rung up as $18. And then when I hand him my card he quickly adds to it to make it $29 and then changes my friend's to $18, so quickly you wouldn't even know it, without saying a word.

These people are rude, if not criminal.

I let it go as a 'mistake' but it's grown on me I felt the need to put in a negative review it's upset me so much.

It's old Korean man who works there at the register. I should have refused but it's only $10 but the more I think about it the more angry I become because he did it so purposely and so blatantly and then, of course, doesn't understand english.

I do not recommend, this was practically criminal. The food was okay, the younger woman is nice. There's some old lady, probably the man's wife, who came up without saying a word and just flung the food down on the table.

** DO NOT RECOMMEND **
Do not come here and pay with credit card, this sleezeball will quickly pull a bait and switch and pass it off as not being able to understand english.

Scum.",0
142,"The Cider Bar is one of my favorite bars in Songdo. The bar is always lively and has a friendly staff. They have a game night one night a month which is always a nice ice breaker to meet people.

The Cider Bar has the Largest Burger in Songdo. In fact I've never left the Cider Bar hungry when I ate there. The Premium Long Island Ice Tea is a must try!",1

145,Me and my friends went for lunch and it was a great day. The staffs are wonderful very friendly and attentive particularly the Filipino lady who served us.The food was delicious and we had a wonderful experience.,1
146,Visited after going to the passport office nearby. We arrived at 12.00 and £48 later we left at 12.35. The menu had all the Korean favourites. We began with rice cakes and fish cakes in a sauce and squid which were nice but nothing special. We followed these with a pork and beef bibimbap. The highlight was the cucumber kimchee with pear. The cabbage kimchee was rather lacklustre. All in all probably good for the office workers nearby but not particularly relaxing. We drank a hite beer and a rice drink,0
147,"So unfortunately the best Korean restaurant in town is on the east side, far far away from my house...  This place across the street from Commercial Center is, in my opinion, the best traditional Korean restaurant in Vegas, by a mile.  Most Korean restaurants are bbq places, and even those are just mediocre.  The only other specialty Korean seems to be tofu joints, except for this place which specializes in gomtang, a soup that is similar to sullungtang and cooked in bone marrow.  

They have parking in the back, but you have to walk around to the front to enter.  It is your typical Korean restaurant decor, which is to say it's not much to speak of.  Service is friendly and speedy.  The menu consists of a various type of gomtang (different main ingredient) and several other popular Korean dishes.  Although oxtail gomtang is one of my favorite dish, we opt for a combination gomtang and a naengmyun.  I'm guessing the gomtang is already made, but perhaps because of naengmyun preparation both dishes take about 10 minutes to come out.

The naengmyun is quite good, with nicely flavored and cold soup.  Wish there was a tad more brisket slices in it though, but otherwise very satisfying.  The gomtang soup tasted great also, and the accompanying kimchi and radish kimchi (kkakdugi) were outstanding.  The kimchi is quite sweet, but I actually liked it.  I am definitely getting the oxtail gomtang next time.

I've probably tried 90% of Korean restaurants in Vegas, and it's not an impressive lot overall except Soyo which is very good, K-bop which is satisfying, and couple in Commercial Center that have a handful of good dishes.  So this one is a keeper, with great service and food on par with typically good places in L.A.  It's a solid 4 stars.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Most places like this are just fine for eating alone.",0
148,"Delicious food, great atmosphere and caring service. What more can you ask for after a long flight. The Cinder Bar has an amazing beer selection from all over the World -- quite impressive. During my visit a patron 'rang the bell' and bought a round for the bar - so much fun!",1
149,"Went there since it was near the hotel we were staying and the reviews were okish. The food didn't blow my mind off, but offered a pleasant change/brake from M. Eastern cuisine.
The spicy dishes were nice (soup and rice cake with vegetables).

This we cooked on a BBQ plate in the middle of the table or we could have cooked in the kitchen.. Who knows any chef who would let you cook in their kitchen..!!! There are several dipping sauces that complimented the meat well..
We experienced and tasted new flavours..Great fun for all the family..
Cost for 3 people £55 including drinks.",1

This place is absolutely dull!
Walls are white and empty, light is very cold in whole restaurant and because of that u feel like in hospital.
They haven't got cloths hanger, that's little bit uncomfortable.

We took Ramen and Bibimbap (a) with set of suchi

Ramen was big and very very hot, noodles in it were very simple and without any special taste (looked like the cheapest fast food noodles), BUT it was spicy, thanks for that!

Bibimbap wasn't tasty at all....we both didn't like it.
Sushi were without any meet or fish, just vegetable sushi, but that were big and tasty.Very simple

Many of the dishes are indeed authentic so people who say otherwise don't on trip adviser don't really know what they are talking about! Nice friendly restaurant with BBQ facility in the center of each table allowing you to cook your own meal if you so desire. Its not a 5* restaurant so don't walk in there with high expectations of glitz and glamour, or outstanding Ritz table service. The prices are reasonable and the service is absolutely fine. I cannot understand such negative reviews from others? God knows what these other people expect? Anyway you cant please everyone but this restaurant certainly pleases me each time I go. Looking forward to my next trip there. Angelo, Sutton Coldfield.",1

155,"I've gone here twice and I'm surprised that both times I've never been served warm or hot food. I feel like the food is taken out from a freezer and placed under a hot lamp to thaw and then covered with sauce. Nothing seems to be cooked. Unfortunately, regardless of whether or not the chicken is at a good serving temperature, it's also not crispy nor tasty. I'm disappointed that this place cannot make a decent plate of the one thing they sell--chicken.

Food: 1/5",0
156,"We've been going to this restaurant since it was located in Karlín. We are always touched to see the amazing job the owners have done during the past years. Their restaurant is growing, and it's not only because of the excellent food - it's the welcoming atmosphere. There is one disadvantage for us - we can't go there for dinner whenever we want anymore - reservations have become needed. I am sure the owners will keep the good job for a very long time and we are happy for them <3",0
157,"This place was not great as I expected looking at the reviews here.
1. The food is extremely expensive. Gomtang at LA usually goes for about 7$ and here it's $10. 
2. Customer service is horrible. We ordered a korean pancake and they said they ran out when we came here for breakfast. And they didn't provide anything to make up for it. 
3. We have a little baby in the family and asked if we could just have a small bowl of soup for her because she wasn't hungry to eat a lot. They said they can't give it for free and it costs half price of the adult bowl. At LA they always give a little to babies just for service. And when they gave it, it came with no meat. Just soup for like 5 bucks. 
4. The gontang soup tastes just okay. The soup is a little clear and it's because they use a lot of water and I can taste the msg in it. I'm gonna be super thirsty later. 
5. The one star only goes for the kkak doo gee (Korean kimchi radish) and the kimchee but I would not come again. 
Even after the horrible service, they still charged us for the little soup. 

This just shows that they want money and don't care about their customers because they have no competition. They're the only Korean restaurant around. Come if you're in Vegas and miss Korean food but this I'm so tired but I have to goto practice):made my family leave Vegas in a horrible mood.",0
158,We had the Korean bbq beef and pork which was nice and taste although I think it's a bit over priced for what it is especially I am cooking the food myself.,1
159,":( I am sad to announce that my long time chinese-korean go-to lunch restaurant for their inexpensive prices and fast, good tasting food has completely changed. I went last weekend and we shared a chicken and a beef bento box as usual. The pieces of meat were just low quality (tendons and just tough), room temperature, and weren't sliced nicely. I guess the soup and sides were still decent. I remember a box was 4 bucks back in primary school, and its been raising since...now its $7 - $7.25...that's a bit much considering the quality decline. Okay, and then I used to love the pork bone soup here although it was never authentically korean. But wow, this time, there was barely any meat on the few bones, a few chunks of hard uncooked potatoes, a few pieces of shred cabbage, and the broth tasted artificial - it was spicy but lacked any meat flavour. It costed $10.  I would probably still go to the DT location for their lunch KBBQ for 15 dollars probably.",0
160,"We got to our hotel late and wanted to try some street food on the way to dinner and Yoogane was on our restaurant list. It’s a casual restaurant with lots of young, local customers. There were 3 of us and we wanted to try multiple galbi options. He suggested just one order for 2 as it was a lot of food and should be able to serve 3 adults. We didn’t listen, but at least he tried to stop us. We ordered the spicy galbi with cheese for 2. The meat, dipped and curled around the melted cheese was divine. We next ordered the mixed honey and marinated galbi with a cheese river separating the two meats. Again very good. You may need to double check that the meat is cooked through as a few pieces needed to be cooked a bit longer. It wasn’t a problem as you just moved it to the side to cook longer. They have a little self service bar where you can pick up your own kimchee, soybean soup...The 3 of us nearly finished the 2 complete orders. If we had more time, we would have gone back for another meal.",1
161,"It is so refreshing to do some grilling again.
THis is a good place for friends to sit down, chill and cook out.
The place is average, decor does not add a feel of being in an Asian food place.
Service is ok, they do help other customers who are new to table top grill experience.
The food is satisfying, especially since it's been a long time since we've had some grilled meat on the table. But I would say I've had better in the past. Also, there were only three side dishes. In authentic Korean restaurants, they provide about 5 or more with unlimited refills.

Nevertheless, if you miss the experience, this place provides some semblance to Korean grills in the UK",1
162,"I made a reservation for 2 people by calling the day earlier. I turned up the next day on time but the whole restaurant was packed and not a single table was empty. I informed them of my reservation and the 2 staff didn't seem to be aware of the reservation. So I was made to wait for 5-6 mins while they cleared up a table for me.

We ordered the following to about £45:
- Veg mandu - not tasty, just average but the apple cide vinegar dip was nice
- Spicy Calamari - the best dish of everything we had. the sauce is sweet & spicy.
- Pa jeon - seafood pancake was tasty as well
- Kimchi fried rice - shouldn't have ordered this as it was bland and the kimchi wasn't as spicy or tasty. Served with a lovely Miso soup however!
- Chicken spicy noodles - had a spicy taste and the chicken tasted good.

very generous portions of the rice and noodles. We were sated at the end. The mains were disappointing but the starters were good. Would prolly order their popular Bibimbap next time.

The staff were friendly and the service was quick considering the crowded place. however I felt that 2 people are not enough to run the service and reception. Definitely need another pair of hands on a busy afternoon.",0

We then had to sit ourselves down and nobody even came to serve us for an entire 15 minutes. When staff finally came to us after 15 minutes,they provided us with a menu and only 10 seconds later, asked what we wanted. When we asked for a minute to decide,the waitress rolled her eyes and sighed heavily. Later, a foreign family of four ladies came and experienced the same treatment. Their response was to leave the restaurant which I now wished we did. The food here was mediocre at best and our only wish was to get up and leave as soon as possible. Do yourself a favor and do not enter this establishment. If you like rude customer service, then this place is perfect for you!",1

Friend had the hot pot soup with seafood, she says not very fresh seafood and too salty.",0
170,I had a little trouble finding the place but once I did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet. Amazing! The beer was ice cold and served in good portions. Beer price was a little steep for me but I hit happy hour just right so I got a bit of a break. Totally satisfied. Pro tip if you are trying to find it: if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it's on the left side of the street before the bridge. It's in a bit of an alcove in a housing development. Set back off the road a tad. There's a sign the points left and I made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road. Unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it. Obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it's the first set of building after the bridge on the right. The staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice. The fish and chips are phenomenal. Did I mention the fish and chips are great. You should definitely try the fish and chips.,1
171,"Great food, amazing beer selection! The staff and patrons were very friendly and welcoming! Highly recommend stopping by!.",1
172,"Today, I was craving for Korean food for lunch. And so, after my friend's recommendation and all the positive reviews, I've decided to hive Miss Korea a try. It was the only reason why I went to the city centre today and I was excited.

Upon entering the restaurant, I've noticed the nice yet simple decor. I find it very cosy. I was greeted with a ""hello"" by the waitress, I sat and checked on the menu that looks sumptuous. I was very hungry I couldn't wait to order and feast.

It took quite a few minutes before my order was taken even though it was quiet today. I've ordered for kimchi, jap chae and beef Bulgogi bibimbap. Come the drinks, I asked for korean tea. However I was told that their bar is closed. Ok, I opt for Sprite with loads of ice. But then, I was told they have no ice! At this point,miss a starting to feel a bit annoyed. Alright then, I can do without ice.

I stood up to go to the toilet and the waitress had another news for me. There is no light in the toilet and even said that if I want, I can use my mobile phone as a light! How unacceptable! By this time, I've already lost my appetite. Closed bar, no ice then no
light in the toilet. To top it all, I was told they only accept cash payment as their card machine is broken! What an appalling service I got today. That broken card machine has been their issue for quite some time now! Does it really take long to fix it? I've told the waitress that it has been terrible experience I've had with them today.

And since my appetite has already been spoilt, I left the restaurant without tasting their food. I'm not even sure if I would come back to try it. I was very disappointed. And quite frankly, I don't care if a restaurant's food is good, if the service is bad then I shall never go back nor will I recommend it to any of my friends.

I ended up in Toppoki which is just on the other side and I've enjoyed their food very much.",0
173,"This place has pretty good chicken, but eating with my family all but me and my sister ate the wings we ordered. I didn't know what I wanted when we ordered because they had us order in less than one minute after we sat down and got the menus. Then my sister gets a salad as everyone gets a lot of wings. I wait till they come back to check if we were doing good and I order the Chicken Katsu without the mayo. She says that is good and leaves to go start making the Katsu, or so I thought. And just to be stated there was a group about to leave and another looking at the menu. We wait till after everyone else is almost done eating, roughely 15 to 20 minutes later, when someone else comes up to our table. We make sure that they got my order and they say that they didn't. So I then tell him my order again buffet he leaves before I get to say that I wouldn't like mayo. He still doesn't have the cooks start to make my meal. Sooner after he comes back to the tables, roughely 5 minutes later, and he asks to make sure he has the right order, now he stays for the whole order. He then leaves, now starting to make my meal. Now my sister starts eating a few peanut butter crackers because her salad was not much food and she accidentally drops one on the ground, they  don't offer to help but instead stand at the counter and  laugh at her. When about 10 more minutes till the Katsu finally gets to the table. It doesn't even taste that good and is all ready cold. So overall THIS PLACR IS MUCH OVER RATED!",0
174,"If you remember the old TV shows Cheers, Friends etc. This bar/restaurant is all of that wrapped up into one. The owner Warren makes you feel welcome and a part of some special ""Cinder"" collective. The Cindertonic is an epic G &T. And the most surprising thing is the food... it is very good. We especially love the fish and chips! We order it every time even if we were expecting to eat. Just check it out you won't be sorry. It is a bit out of the way - over by the bridge on ""Flag street"". Cheers!",1

180,I really enjoyed this place. I went there with my Korean friend. Totally affordable and genuine food. Relaxed atmosphere! We spent £28 in total,1
181,"Food is a small step up from Seoule Korea's down the street.  However the service here is very poor and it takes a while for the kitchen to turn out the food.  Ok when you want to just socialize but if you are hungry or have kids who need to eat right away, their level of service is in need of improvement.  Staff is friendly but they don't have enough staff and their turnover seems to be quite high.  
On the food side their BBQ meats are quite flavorful and their seafood pancake is delicious.   It seems like they may have just switched chefs as their food is off just a bit from previous visits.
For folks with allergies it isa bit dangerous due to the wait staff's translation issues.  
So the food is probably a four star but the service really pushes this down to a three at best.  If you can handle poor service but good food, then this is the place for you. 
Cheers and happy eating.",0
182,"Although this isn't authentic Korean BBQ,  it gets the job done. Food's good, and that's all that matters.

Some pros:
- service is great, a lil hard sometimes to track down someone to take your order but with so many other tables to wait on, I'm not too upset about it
- wait time is never bad. The restaurant is big with lots of tables which always makes my visits here one without a wait time or a short one
- prices are great. You get exactly what you pay for with lunch or night owl specials making prices even better
- the AYCE menu has a pretty decent selection but if that's not enough, there's an extensive list of non-AYCE dishes to choose from
- restaurant atmosphere is also great. Really nice place to chill and catch up with friends.
- location of the restaurant is great. I say this because I like to skip out on getting dessert here and heading right across from the restaurant to Coco Tea and Juice.

Some cons:
- sometimes servers' inability to speak English sucks. One time I ordered tofu and kimchi soup off the AYCE menu and they brought me tofu and kimchi side dishes instead. I asked for it to be taken away and attempted to order my soup again,  and once again they brought me side dishes. Happened again and I gave up and realized I wasn't going to get my soup.
- wish their veggie side dishes were more extensive
- wish they had sauces to eat the meats with considering their meats and veggies aren't seasoned.

That's all I have to say. If you're looking for a chill night out with our spending too much money, I recommend this place.

EDIT: I've recently become vegetarian since writing this review and something amazing at this Korean Grill House is their willingness to let me order off the AYCE menu while the rest of the table can still do AYCE. I've called other locations to see if they did this and this appears to be the only one willing to do so which makes it the best location in my books!",0
183,"The service was good, you just filled out what you wanted on paper and it was brought to your table within a few minutes. No hot sauce though. The food was good but there's no exhausts in the restaurant so it gets really foggy and the smell is everywere.",0
184,"We visited this place one year ago and left unimpressed then. This time we arrived as a group of four for our meal and after ordering our food, service initially started very well. We got our drinks and the dishes started to arrive but after some time we were ignored. Our requests for drinks were ignored and after the first 3-4 dishes we ordered we had to wait 15-20 mins for the remainder of the dishes to arrive. It was then we noticed that the place wasn't that busy but they were serving dishes to the other tables that had arrived after us. The BBQ and seafood pancake was delicious and the bibimbap and teriyaki eel was passable. But the worst of all was the soft tofu stew. It was nothing like we had ever tried before. It was lacking in flavour and was more like a clear soup with bits of tofu, cucumber and one egg in it. At the end, when we asked for the bill we were also slapped with a 10% TAX at the end for poor service. We didn't complain but this is one place we will definitely not be coming back to.

Keep in mind, this place serves BBQ but has no ventilation system installed so it also becomes very stuffy and smoky. You will definitely leave the place smelling of BBQ and smoke.",0
185,"Came here for lunch on a Friday and there were still seats available. Had 3 portions of the seafood dakgalbee with Joons sauce (B) and mozzarella cheese and ramen. If you like even more spice you can add it for +$0.50.

Servers are really friendly, they used to let you cook your own dakgalbee at the table, but not anymore. I think this diminishes the appeal of the dish a little bit, but if you've never had it you should try it. If you have had it, you might be a little disappointed. 

For the three of us, it came close to $18/person, so not really the best value.",0
186,"I came here on monday and i have to say the food is amazing we had 3 dishes and i couldnt fault anything! The staff very so friendly it was a pleasure to go in... ive walked past several times on the weekend and there is always a que to get in, so i would suggest a week night.. i will definatly be returning soon",1
187,"Where should I begin..  I came here for their famous ramen dish. The restaurant is tight-spaced and pact however, the wait in line was decent and took about 10 - 15 mins. Let's get to the point now. The food. It was great. I guess it depends on what toppings you add on but I find that cheese can make most things taste that much better. to be honest,  I am not a ramen or any kind of instant noodle fan. I try to avoid them as much as possible but the images my friends sent me of this place kind of sparked my curiosity. You basically get a pan of ramen which can be shared between 2-3 people depending how many other toppings you add. I feel that once you add them up, it can cost quite a bit. I got the cheese, rice cake, fish cake, veggies and extra ramen for this ramen dish and it was shared among two people. Definitely filled both of us. I think if many of my friends like ramen, I'll come back with them. Only downside is that the ramen was a tad dry. I wish they had more sauce. Other than that, I probably will not come here myself. But definitely had a good experience with an average friendly service.",0
188,"With a new draught font increasing the variety of beers offered, you will find a beer to your liking.",1
189,"friendly people who work here (love the service!!) , but bad food (fake crab in crab Rangoon! with ketchup for sauce) small portions and cheap ingredients. they don't have an official menu posted online, but the menu I did find gave totally inaccurate pricing and said all lunch specials came with an egg roll (which they do not) 

I will not be returning to China Wing. Gives a whole new meaning to cheap Chinese.",0
190,"Never had Korean style fried chicken before. We ordered a combo chicken with half and half spice. The wings definitely have better flavor as the drums were not very seasoned (if at all) besides the batter on the outside. The lunch portion was very big. We also ordered the japchae. It was well seasoned and tasty but very little bulgogi which was disappointing. Lastly, we ordered a spicy mayo to go with the fries but it wasn't in our to go bag. We were charged for it, so make sure you check your takeout before leaving.",0
191,"The worst restaurant in Montreal !! The hostess told us 30 min wait and  it end it up 1:30 hour of waiting. After 15 min on our table the waitress said we only have 10 min to give our last order! She pressured us to pay before we finished eating.
we received the meat at first and the appetizer at last!
The food was tasteless. We had to tell the waitress 4 times to bring a knife and to refill the water.",0
192,"Went here for a family birthday and got platter of meat to share. I enjoyed the simple combination of really good meat with fresh Asian-style salad- which the staff were always quick to top up.

I felt that some of the meats could have come with more sauces or marinades but it was my first time having Korean barbecue style and maybe that's normal- I don't know but I'd be eager to try more and find out!",1
193,"I have eaten here twice, both times with a friend.

The first time I thought the food was pretty good, especially the starter of spicy calamari. My main of beef bulgogi was a bit too salty, and didn't come with any lettuce.

My second visit was a few weeks later. Again I ordered the spicy calamari, which was pretty good. But this time I went for the beef bibimbap, and found it very bland.

Also both times the service wasn't very good. I waited a very long time both times before anyone came to take our orders. Also one of the times we were running late by about 10 minutes. As we were on the tube we didn't have signal to ring ahead and let them know. As we arrived, the waitress very sacasrtically said ""we're a bit late aren't you"". I wasn't impressed.

I don't think I'll be returning here, as there are many better korean restaurants in central London.",0
194,"From now on when I travel to Korea, I'll be visiting Cinder Bar! Warren the owner was so friendly and welcoming, and I certainly felt very comfortable socializing with all the great people who go there. Great food, great drinks and all round a fantastic night! If your in Korea, this is a must visit!",1
195,"Visited for an early evening dinner and found the food to be average overall.

My starter, beef bulgogi, was delicious and had a lot of flavour. The kimchi pancakes were OK but tasted very little of kimchi.

The bibimbap was average - fresh ingredients but very little taste. It needed a lot more seasoning.

Would I return? No.",0
196,"The burner is built into each table and the server puts a pan on the hot plate and then stir fries the spicy chicken, vegetables and rice to create the dak galbi which is the signature dish. I just sat back and enjoyed my beer while watching my food being prepared right in front of me. The servers are moving quickly from table to table so it's rather impersonal service but I enjoyed it very much.",1
197,"Restarant is comfortable, staff very friendly, I came with my girlfriend and we had great time.
I gave 5 stars and would recommend to have Korean BBQ here.",1
198,"Great little spot. Kind of hidden, basically the first place on the new city side of the bridge. Good food, good drinks. But like everything in Korea, it is small compared to American standards, no worries if the weather is nice, you can spill out onto the street.",1
199,My coworkers and I order at this restaurant on a pretty regular basis the past 3 years. We noticed that the service was getting worse as time goes by. My coworker called for a pick up order and was told that they just opened and to call back 30 minutes later! We have people who did not like kimchi so we asked not to put it in their lunch which before was not a problem but now we were told to just take it out ourselves! Was very surprised how this place seems to have no idea about providing good customer service. Very disappointed as they do have good food.,0
200,"The original chicken without any of the spicy sauces is very good. Great flavor, moist and crispy crust. But if you choose to get any of the sauces (tossed to order), ask for sauce on the side. I wasn't aware so I got my chicken tossed in the sweet and spicy sauce and although I can take heat, this was mind-numbingly spicy. All of your taste buds will be burned off for the day. I had massive FIRE BUTT all day as well. Get the sauce ON THE SIDE!!!",0
201,Looks a bit grim from outside but once you go in its bustling and lively. Very good food. Huge portions for the meal set d. Probably would feed 3 or 4 not the recommended 2. The place is relatively small and was very busy on a Tuesday night. Booking recommended.,1
202,"Hi All,
I would recommend this place very highly if your a foodie and want to explore authentic Korean cuisine. the standard menu chronologically designed to give you variety of food to your taste buds.
and the place is more than 60 year old and Korea house has a legacy of being dining place for Korean dynasty.
If you are in Seoul, South Korea. this is must visit place.

regards,
NT",1
203,"Ok, it is Vegas and Summerlin, after all... so really should not expect authentic Korean food...that said, waitress brought wrong gochujang sauce for bibim bap...a Korean staple! When I initially asked for it, she had no clue! Enough said? Just more overpriced wannabee Korean fare...wish these restaurant owners would put more focus on taste and quality, no matter where you are!",0
204,Food is amazing but seriously the service is awful still worth going tho the quality of the food outweighs the crap service,0
205,"This place has gone way down hill since we last visited.  We went here for lunch yesterday.  It was very quiet.  The hostess was very unfriendly, couldn't break a smile the whole time we were there and when we said we didn't understand the menu she just walked away.  The waitress told us that the lunch menu came with rice and a salad.  So we were surprised when she bought us miso soup and tempura dipping sauce.  My hubby got his meal first and surprise it came with tempura!  Then we waited ........ and waited and waited.  We heard the buzzer from the kitchen and then I saw the chef come out looking for a waitress, no one in sight!  Finally got my meal and it was just ok.

Overall we were very disappointed we were there for an hour and hubby had to get back to work.  As we left we said thanks to the hostess and she just ignored us.  Maybe shes stressed because of the lack of business?  Well step it up lady!!!!

Will not be back!",0
206,"We ordered kimchi jjigae( kimchi soup) ,  toboki and Kamja tang( pork bone soup)

Toboki is sweeter here not that spicy but still pretty good

The portion here are smaller,and they only provide four side dishes. 

Wouldn't recommend this place in north York finch area, there are many other better restaurants with larger portion and cheaper price here.",0
207,"A lovely cozy bar. They made me some amazing fish sliders and I washed it down with the best gin and tonics I have ever tasted. I was there on business by myself but I left the Cinder Bar with some excellent new friends. The music selection was great and they even have live music from time to time. To Hanna, Warren and the Cinder crew, keep doing what you are doing.. It works.",1
208,"We had a few great experiences here but it has since gone downhill - maybe a new chef?? We usually get the pad Thai & green curry, sometimes the red curry. This past order - the bean sprouts had gone bad in the pad Thai which gave the entire dish a funky taste. The curry wasn't spicy and didn't taste authentic as it had before. I contacted them but never heard back.",0
209,"I have always been the type that picks quantity over quality.  But as i age, i have started to notice that i don't eat as much anymore and would rather focus more on taste than consumption. 

This place used to be my go to place for beef.  Our table would easily have 25 stacks of those plates in which they use to bring the raw beef out.  After tonight, i think i counted 5 in total.  The quality seems to have taken a dip as well.  Chicken, pork, sausages and fish were... let's say, not the greatest.  

Dinner for 3 including 3 drinks came out to $67 with tax and tip.  I would rather go to ayce jap buffet in the future.  

On the positive side, i walked out rather than being rolled out.  Lol

Will i come back... probably not.  But the night time buffet caught my attention.  Hard to go wrong for $10.99 ayce beef.  Lol",0
210,"It is a family 'bar', we went there with our kid and we have a fun time, and meet new people. Everyone was friendly (even customers). It is a cool place and loved the chicken wings!",1
211,"I visited this new restaurant with my Korean born family for a celebration, after a recommendation. I was so pleased I chose here because everyone was very impressed with the food and the atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing. The interior has a contemporary design feel.
We went for the barbecue at your table option and cooked the meat ourselves which was good fun and made for an inclusive experience as we fought for control of the tongs and argued over who was to be chef.
We had the Sam Gyup Sal ( 3 layered pork) , Doe Ji Bulgogi( marinated pork) , So Bulgogi ( marinated beef), Saeng galbi (beef ribs) and Doenjang jjigae ( traditional stew). It was all excellent, particularly the meat I cooked ㅎㅎ. I would particularly recommend the Sam Gyup Sal which was a really flavoursome piece of meat.
Service was efficient and friendly and for me the bill was very reasonable.
I am looking forward to visiting again and trying some different dishes.",1
212,"If you like Galbi or Pork Bulgogi, this is the place. Great kimchi. Service was excellent tonight. Food came out hot. Everything was superb. You know it's good when it's packed with Koreans. I've been going here for 20 years. My favorite restaurant. Glad it's close by. If you like Korean food , this is the ONLY place to go.",1
213,"Overall satisfaction experience.
Marinated chicken and octopus stir fried with cabbage, green onions. Easy to order and just add on noodles ,cheese or rice. The meal will be cooked at your table where you can enjoy the sizzling sound , see that fancy red and finally enjoy the full taste.

But the only restrictions is meal must be ordered in the exact number of people s Portion so",1
214,"I was here in a Wednesday afternoon. Business was very slow. The location was kinda bad?! (I am an outsider).

The food is on the pricy side, but it's very traditional.
They only provided three side dishes. (Two kinds of Kimchi and the green peppers)

I ordered the mixed beef soup. It came with a bowl of rice. It was delicious, but I probably will not go back due to the location.",0
215,"I usually do not review much or complain much for that matter. But I feel I need to say something. 

I entered this restaurant and was directed to sit down. No hello No good evening. I should have taken the welcome or lack of one as a sign. 

When the menu was placed in front of me I was given 30 seconds to order. I felt rushed and pressured. 

So I ordered my dish then before I can continue my beverage and app order she took a step away as if she's in a rush and I'm slowing her down. 

Long story short she got my order wrong. I knew she got my order wrong because she gave me no time of day to listen to me and to allow me to properly order. 

When I proceeded to tell her my order was wrong she said I don't need to pay for it if I don't like it. 

All this while the owner just stood there cooking her lunch on a portable grill. 

I am not expecting the world when it comes to food and service In a Asian quick service restaurant but this was ridiculous. 

Joons is great for a hearty well priced quick meal. But not if you wish to be treated like crap. 

I ended up paying for my meal and leaving a tip while the owner and waitress swore and complain about me. 

That's very noble and nice Joons. Great way to treat your customers.",0
216,"My parents, fiance and myself had been looking forward to dine at this restaurant. We headed there a little later in the afternoon to miss the lunch crowd. When we got there, there was no queue and a bunch of tables available. GREAT!!! .

The ladies headed over to the restroom but there was a queue. My dad and myself had a seat and looked through the menu. We decided on what we wanted to eat and my mum got back and started looking through the menu.

Here is when our mood was totally killed. My lady wasn't even back yet, and its been no more than 5 minutes. This guy, whom i assume is the Supervisor, cause he was in a different uniform, came up to our table aggressively and raised his voice saying, 'Order NOW, YOU SIT HERE SO LONG'. I explained, my wife is in the toilet, dont worry once shes out we will order'. He shouts, 'NO ORDER NOW' and flings the menu at my 64 year old dad.

Things have clearly already gone out of hand. I tell my parents to pack and i stood up and told him to back off. I was FUMING. This went way too far. If my parents and lady were not there, this would have gone alot worse.

We stood up and left. I am disgusted by this establishment, and would NEVER recommend stepping foot in this horrendous place. Picture of the 'Supervisor' included.",1
217,"I stopped in at the suggestion of coworkers. I wasn't disappointed. Warren (the owner) gave me a warm greeting and took very good care of me. The bar was a mix of local and expat patrons. Great selection of beer and although I didn't eat here, from what I saw the food looked very good (western style) and people seemed to enjoy it.

I'll definitely go back the next time I'm in Incheon.",1
218,"I've been to a TON of Korean restaurants in my time and will say this place is not as good as folks say. First, size DOES matter... This place is so small that it is uncomfortable. Seriously. I have never dined in a public place this tiny and dirty. I assume that because this business is shoehorned in a cinder block bunker there is no place to store cleaning agents but in full sight of customers. I was literally rubbing elbows with some stranger and neither one us was happy about it... Second, don't bother asking for water unless you want to pay for bottled. I needed to take a prescription pill and was lectured about how they don't have glasses for water. Seriously? I stood my ground and was brought room temperature tap water in a styrofoam cup. Nice. Onto the food. I had the kimchi pancakes. They were what one would expect. I then ordered gimbop. It was average. We also shared a vegetable fried rice. It
 was average. I asked for hot sauce and the owner flipped out on me. Informed me that hot sauce will ruin the dish...thanks for the lecture, but I like my food spicy and I'm paying for it...so...give me hot sauce sans lecture. To drive 40 minutes from the city to get jammed into this ugly space to eat average Korean is not my idea of a culinary experience. I suppose if my car breaks down in Cecil I might be back to the Golden Pig. Otherwise, there are better options.",0
219,"Book a table well in advance, get e- mail confirmation.

Take train into Edinburgh, travel light with cash for a few beers, card to pay for meal.

Go see a Festival show in George Street and then 15 minute walk up to Tarvit Street.

Table ready for us, sit down handed menus, all good so far.

Just about to order and the wife spots the ""cash only"" sign at the till at the back of the restaurant. We ask the waitress if it was indeed cash only and she says ""network was down"".

Only have card with me so we have to sheepishly leave the restaurant.

Fair enough that the network was down (a first for me) but surely they could have emailed or phoned us to let us know?

As the Festival was on everywhere was full so had to head back to the train station hungry

Warren and staff are very friendly and warm! The place to go to !",1
222,"In Town for a conference and spent some time searching for a place to have a drink. Uncovered Cinders after a detailed search but surprised that they weren't top of the search.

Owner, Warren, an extremely friendly and welcoming host! A range of beers to cater for taste and an even better selection of spirits for even the most discerning palate.

I started with a malty indiga (American craft) served with some dubiously crunchy (typically Korean) nuts and graduated through Guinness and Stella Artois to an extremely reasonably priced local lager. Even a selection of Scottish beers and islay malt whiskeys for the more selective drinker.

Would highly recommend the venue to anyone!",1

Unlike when I have had Korean BBQ in Asia, here there are no extractors above the tables which does lead to a slightly smokey atmosphere and you defiantly leave smelling of a garlic-y bbq.
But all in all, a great find for some fun and tasty food.",1
231,I really want to give them no star at all. It was the WORST customer service ever! We  waited almost 5 minutes  for  each of our orders to come out. They were not busy and employees were just standing there. Also our waiter clocked out on his shift and he did not inform about it so we were waiting  10 to 15 minutes for our orders with the grill still on until we asked another waiter about it. He informed us about our waiter's status and we were shock about it.  The meats were all frozen and they didn't give us a lot squid but a lot vegetable with 5 small pieces of squid. Also we told the manger about our experiences and he didn't care . Yeahhhh.... I'm not coming back and will definitely will tell my friends and family relatives about this experience.,0
232,"Yelpers beware: this establishment is in shambles. The food quality is really terrible. But what's worse is the service. Both the waiter and the manager were so unapologetic. The food was delayed, lost, and delayed again. The fire didn't function. And all the while the waiter and manager pretty much found the situation comical. Instead of apologizing, they made excuses and blamed it on capacity. The over experience was baffling. Save yourself the headache and go anywhere else.",0
233,"On my entry I was asked how many people? When I replied that I was dining alone without explanation the male bespectacled waiter pointed to the door and shouted OUT. I demanded the reason and eventually I was told that lone diners were not welcome.

I just didn't feel any of the food was really great given the other reviews. I ordered the Kimchi-jjigae but found it to be a little too watery (more like a soup than a stew). Staff were attentive and overall it was a fair experience. I would also say the place is quite small, and the seating on the wall was a little uncomfortable. Two starters, a side dish and three mains with drinks for three people came to around £60",0

238,Yoogane is located in the heart of Myeongdong. Price is standard in Seoul and portion is for 2-4 persons. The specialty of this restaurant is dakgalbi which is chicken and cooked with rice . Our children liked it so much. Side dish is also simple with kimchi as main side dish.,1

245,"We ate here due to the excellent reviews. The food is similar to that served by our local Japanese restaurant so we had something to compare it to.
The Miso soup was thin and watery.
The noodles were lukewarm and tasteless. We ordered seafood and vegetables, but the only vegetables were a few peppers and onions.
The staff paid very little attention to us, although when asked whether we'd enjoyed our meal and told it was not very hot, said they would have heated and took the service charge off our bill.
A disappointing experience.",0
246,Fantastic meal. Ordered a verity of marinated meats along with some sides. Fantastic food. I have never visited a Korean BBQ restaurant before and this has really surprised me. Great food and fairly inexpensive. The staff were also very friendly and didn't give me too many bad looks for my inability to use chopsticks!,1

The Owner Warren is from New Zealand and is a great character to have a chatter with over a good spirit/ cocktail.

Great for expats to get a good drink!",1
249,"I had never been to a ""Korean BBQ"" before, so the entire experience was new to us. Luckily the staff is very friendly and helpful, and they were there to assist us in ""preparing"" our meal! You have a heating plate built into the center of each table, on which you ""barbecue"" your own food (meat, prawns, etc.), or you can order one of the prepared stir-fried dishes. One of us had the BBQ, and the other got stir-fried. We both extremely enjoyed our meals. Whether you have stir-fried or BBQ, the ""Korean way"" of eating it is by placing some of your cooked meal on a lettuce leaf, adding some of the condiments they bring you (spicy radish/bean sprouts/sauce), rolling it up, and eating the roll. Very tasty, and a fun/interesting way to eat, to boot! The prices were also quite reasonable. Highly recommended!",1
250,"food was decent, but the price for Korean/Chinese food was too high for the amount of food we got. we spent $60 for 2 kids and 2 adults and no one came out satisfied :( really wanted to give 5 stars cuz the service was great, but it was not worth it.",0
251,"we read the reviews and thought this would be an interesting experience, well it certainly was!
We arrived early as advised and there was no one else there, 4 waitresses came over with menus, and stood around us waiting for our order. None of them seemed to speak English, and watched over us for a good 20 mins, while we tried to work out the menu, lots of variety but prices quite high.
A lot of large groups started to arrive, and we got our food before the floor show began.food was nothing special, but the show was quite good.
Seemed to be a lot of business men there leering at the waitresses, and lots of smokers.
Probably wouldn't bother going again, there's plenty of better restaurants to visit in Town.
Also when we got the bill there was no card facilities, luckily we had enough cash on hand to pay!",0
252,"After reading the reviews and having walked past the customers queuing up outside for quite some time, we went for dinner. We came early and managed to get seated with no wait. You can only make a reservation if you plan on dining two or more days out. The inside is very small. Service was very attentive. For starters, we had soy chicken and the cucumber kimchee. Both were excellent. For mains, we had the beef bibimbap and the beef bulgogi. Both were mediocre. No real flavor, very disappointing. If we do go back, it won't be anytime soon.",0
253,I really enjoyed the food and they have a good beer selection. It's a must visit if you're in Incheon.,1
254,"I love Korean food and this was recommended by a friend while visiting, it was top quality very tender meat and great service.",1
255,My wife and I shared the ribs which were well seasoned and accompanied by 6 smaller side dishes. It was plenty to share. Next time I will try the grill and cook on our own.,1
256,Le poulet frit est mallllllllllllllaaaaaaadeeeeeeeee! 횉a fait longtemps que j'ai pas eu du aussi bon fried chicken. Poulet juteux et chapelure au top! Tu peuxn pas tromper en allant l횪-bas au niveau du poulet frit!,0
257,I don't recommend this place! The price is a little to high. The costumer sieves is terrible! They demand you leave them 15% of tip. & are rude to non-Asians. Just had a terrible experience here while eating with friends. To expensive!! Go at your own risk  never going back there!,0
258,"I quickly learned that the Korean food scene is pretty non-existent in the Charlotte area. I have actually put off writing this review with hopes of coming back but that hasn't happened.

I ordered jap chae and bulgogi. The food is good but pricey. I paid $30 for two dishes and was surprised at how small my containers were. The bulgogi was tender but not the super thin cuts of meat I was anticipating. It was more chunky but still tasty. The jap chae noodles were on the very soft side. I am very familiar with sweet potato noodles and I just felt that they were not cooked fresh, had been sitting for a while and warmed up with fresh veggies on my order. I could be wrong and maybe they just over boiled them but I wasn't impressed.

I have wanted to go back just to try their bibimbap but just haven't yet. If I get a hankering for Korean and I am going to spend as much I spent, I rather go to the Asian market and make everything my self.",0
259,"Great bar friendly owner and staff, make you feel welcome, and will remember your name on your next visit. Cheers🍻",1
260,"Went in this place after saw lot of people in there. Staff don’t have patient to answer our question and been rude (I know they’re busy but this is not the way to handle foreign customer). Some dishes cannot be share if you have more people (in my case 5 person) and forced us to pick some dishes that charged us per pax. Staff only came once in a while to stir the raw meat, and we had to do it our own before they came to our table.",0
261,"we came here for lunch before our flight back home, the restaurant was packed with locals and tourist alike. As you can guess, all the offerings revolved around Chicken.

Food is nice, especially with the sauce but for two persons, the taste gets ""heavy"" midway through.

the staff are attentive and efficient, a smile would be nice though.

pricing is not expensive and it is value for money

the only negative is the food smell, make sure you dont bring your favourite heavy coats, or go there during your last day so that the smell that lingers doesnt irk you too much.",1
262,"The best Korean Restaurant I ever visited.
The staff is very attentive and friendly.
The food is so delicious. The menu offers a variety of choices.
Korean BBQ, or Udon noodles or Sushi.
Every bite was so delicious.

Note, that you need to pay cash here.
No credit card accepted.",0
263,"I was craving Korean Fried Chicken and called a pickup order for a full chicken to share with my friends. We ordered olive fried and sweet spicy and picked it up in 10 minutes. We happily went home to eat it, but after one bite of the sweet spicy, our mouths were on fire and it turned out they gave us the wrong flavour. Also, the fried chicken was also just tossed with the sauce and therefore spicy flavour was only 1/2 covered with sauce. 

Anyhow, we went to go return switch it back. NBD everyone makes mistakes and they apologized but we had some trouble communicating what went wrong because they seemed really frazzled and busy even though the store was almost empty. 

The chicken was alright, not great but I think it wasn't worth the money or the hassle. 

TL;DR 
Taste 3/5, Serivce 2/5",0
264,Servers were friendly. But the food was bad. I ordered ribeye and the meat had no marbling at all. I'm sure it was  sirloin or something. They must think their customers are fool.,0
265,Simply delicious and reasonably priced! We had a set with both the spicy and honey seasoned chicken with noodles and its good! Will definitely go again when I'm in Seoul.,1
266,"i would have never thought that this place could reserve such a surprise!
we had the buffet (6€). we didn't eat meat but the rest was more than enough! there is a selection of korean pickles (kimchi, cucumber pickles, carrots, beets, delicious stuffed peppers and others) you can tell that they are homemade. kimtchi was not particulary strong flavoured, as i like it, but my companion preferred it like this.
the lady prepared for us freshly deep fried vegetables puffs, banana and fish fillets. I was really surprised, the fish was actually really tasty and fresh, perfectly well cooked, juicy and delicious! even the rest rest was not greasy at all.

there were a few other dishes that I haven't tried, from what i could see it was noodles in different sauces with veggies and meat. there was a hot and sour meat soup as well, and rice of course!

I was so happy of changing my mind about this little family-run restaurant. the owners really care about what they are doing, and even though they don't have many clients, whenever someone arrives they treat him like a real host at their place.

the furnishings is really heavy and peculiar, but in its own way it gives a feeling of authenticity (though not Korean! elvis was printed all over on the seats :) ). the owners seem to be there out of any pretention, if not to do the best they can to prepare good food.

i left this little place with a smile and bitterness too,for having prejudged koreas Haus as just another fake orientalish imbiss for so long before TRYING IT!

well at least it has been a good lesson for me! and maybe for you as well!",1
267,"After the wife suggested Korean for the first time ever and we googled it, this place came up with mixed but mainly good reviews even right here on Trip advisor. We though we'd give it a go. After driving around Gulf hotel apartments twice I had to get out of the car to walk around a little but eventually found it. Location could be better however that's all made up for when you try the food.

Small premises but comfortable, ambiance a little lacking as well and the food quality actually deserves a better more fitting authentic Korean mood in a nicer more accessible premises.

Anyway to the food, we ordered the Marinated Korean BBQ beef, the mixed spicy/sweet chicken, the Kimche rice and vegetable rice. The order came with an amazingly zestful tasty cold soup and a lot of sides and sauce . From the moment this stuff hit my tastebuds I was in heaven and I have now added Korea to one of those places one must visit before they die if only just for the food. Fragrant, aromatic, mouth watering, and satisfying. We will definitely be back don't care what the naysayers have to say. Friendly staff however a little on the pricey side (reduction of prices or family/group offers would greatly increase the traffic)

I highly recommend it and I'm
A fussy bugger",1
268,"Based on the raving review of a guy who just exited this place, my friend & I decided to come back & try the chicken. She ordered the classic olive oil fried chicken with sweet spicy sauce. I ordered the boneless sweet spicy chicken meal ($8.75). The boneless chicken was hard & the sauce was not spicy. I had this with some dry waffle fries & a lemonade. My friend's chicken (2 pieces) was a bit better since her chicken was tender. But she thinks she can reproduce this dish by smothering fried chicken with gochujang & simple syrup. We thought the price was too much for what we received. Korean chicken comes with much hype. But what we found here didn't live up to it. Now we know.",0
269,"We tried the Chicken Galbi and it was really an excellent experience. Basically they get raw marinated chicken with optional veggies, bulgogi or seafood and cook it on a large pan on your table. Everyone on the table needs to have the same dish as its communal eating and they bill you per head.",1
270,"I went there with my families last Saturday for lunch. The food really was not very impressive. We won't go back again anyways. However, what really got me motivated to write a review was their side dishes got me severe food poisoning for almost 3 days. After lunch at Arirang, I had stomach cramps and diarrhea. My whole body was chilled, fatigued, and sweating. It's been the 3rd day since I went there and my stomach still cramps. A really bad experience and I will not recommend this restaurant!",0
271,"I went to Seoul Chako yesterday with my girlfriend during lunch hour. Normally 13.99, we had student discounts that reduced the price to 10 dollars. 

There were very few people in the restaurant while we were there, I'd say 3-4 other patrons at the most (keep in mind this is a hot Thursday noon).  

AMBIANCE:
Top-notch. This is a very new restaurant, and the interior design and amnesties show that. Each table has their own grill, and it's a very high-tech one at that. They have their own inbuilt ventilation system that takes away the messiness and teary eyes usually associated with grilling your own food. 

SERVICE:
Quick and professional, though i wasn't particularly used to the way we ordered the food. Unlike similar asian buffet restaurants such as Tokyo/Kanda/Crescent sushi,  you don't write your order down on a piece of paper; instead the waiter comes around every so often to take your order. As a result we had to order food 3 times, a needless stress really. 

FOOD:
Here is where Seoul Chako falls a bit short. In one word, food is SALTY. Everything from the meat, to the soups, to the sushi. I had to down 2 glasses of water during the meal. Beef is definitely the highlight on the menu, it is tender and tasty. Short ribs were hard to cook, and overly fatty. The chicken and octopus were way too salty for my liking. 

Sushi is also served here, though they aren't as good as Tokyo Sushi across the street. 

All in all, I would highly recommend this to any students who can get their hands on coupons (and man are they plentiful). Worth it for 10 bucks, not sure whether or not the normal priced lunch/dinner would be as good as a deal.",0
272,Not recommended for bug families as you will be forced to order the same item since there is only 1 hot plate per table of 4. You have choice to add side items. Meat is sufficiently marinated and tasted good. Interesting to see how the server prepared the food. What is good is you can help yourself to the salad and preserved radish. Surprising there was no kimchi. Costs per person average about 7000won,0
273,"I've eaten there once. We ordered for 2 people but it was really too much for 2 people! We were so full! Delicious food, nice place, average price!",1
274,"I found this place online and thought I would pay it a visit. Best decision I've made in quite some time. Everyone, both staff and customers, were extremely friendly. I got a few tips on how to adjust in Korea and a few drinks to forget all the cross cultural mistakes I was making. All in all, this is a great place and the only actual bar where you can sit up on a stool and pound a few pints. Take my word, you are going to want to atleast stop by here once.",1
275,"Usually come here to get the dakgalbi as it's their staple but my recent visit was a bit underwhelming.

Seems like portions have decreased a bit (is it not sweet potato season guys????) and very sadly, our rice cakes were undercooked. If you're here for the first time, I'd recommend the chicken dakgalbi, and you must add the cheese and ramen!! Skip the seafood option as we only got like what, 5 tiny pieces of baby octopus.

This is usually the only place I'll come to for dakgalbi so it'll still do but on the hunt for a better place.",0
276,The best place ever! Feels like home! Cozy and great atmosphere! We are a Cinder Couple and we love Cinder! Highly recommended 👌👌👌,1
277,"I guess you have to expect to pay for the kind of quality you get at The Cinder Bar. Burgers are really good, and they have beer above the standard weak lagers. Worth the price every once in a while!",1
278,Best bar ever!! Always very nice!! Many internationals!! Cloud cloud cloud!!!!! The stuff and it is definitely the nicestplay too hang out after a day in university or at work nice :),1
279,I had a great experience at The Cinder Bar. The drinks were great and the service was even better. I highly recommend visiting if you are in the area!,1
280,"i am not really a typical customer who will write a bad comment. i was really excited to eat here because this is my first time and i came with my friend. but i am very very disappointed with yoogane chicken in myeongdong services especially staff name chang dong na services she has the bob cut hair.

first, staff came to our table asking for the order. she is not very nice from the beginning but i still think maybe she’s busy and in a rush. after we order she’s just take the food in the table and leave. considering me and my friend are first timer eating here we don’t know how to cook the food. and she just leave without saying a word. we assume that we have to cook the food by ourself. and after we trying to put all the food together and cook. she’s just running into our table and say it in korean language with rude tone voice and she throwing out the food from the cooking pan with very very unappropriate way. and she just start talking to the other staff. luckily my friend a lil bit korean language and she just tell me what she said in korea “if i was them, i will not eat the food”

i probably not recommended this restaurant. please treat the customer nicely even when you are busy just do the job proffesionally.",1
281,"If you want to have a great time in Incheon and you are foreign, you should came.to cinder bar ot's a great place to be and have a great time.

Thank you, Cinder bar!br///// Si desean pasar un ageadable momento en Incheon deben venir a este bar, la musica es espectacular y Warren (El dueño) es extremadamente amable, conoce a la gente del bar y te puede presentar a personas que hablan tu idioma.",1
282,I guess fried chicken is the only way to go at this place. My friend and I tried two of their noodle dishes and both were so disappointing. His was the spicy octopus dish - the octopus was tough and practically inedible. I had the black bean noodles - a gloopy and tasteless mess of a plate. So sad. I really wanted to like this place.,0
283,"I was beyond surprised and relieved to find good Korean food in this state. I'm from NYC so my standards for Asian cuisine in general are obnoxious. We had galbi (well seasoned & delicious), ddukbokki (super spicy & wonderful), (average) chicken fried rice and some (average) pork belly. Everything was fresh, authentic & inexpensive. I would come back here if I ever find myself in Longwood again. The staff here is also quite nice.",1
284,"No idea how this got to be a 4 star, with all the other options in the area.  I could see it if it was the only Korean restaurant in some small town, but this is Koreatown, there are better options all around.

Service was fine, no problem there.

Sweet and sour pork was overcooked, wrapped in way too thick batter, sauce tasted of nothing but sugar.  Food court quality.  For close to 20 bucks for the dish, this is a hard no.

Side dishes were low in number and average in quality.  We got 4 in total, 2 of the 4 were just kimchi (one unfermented, one fermented), then you had a marinated potato dish and a tofu.  Meh.

Soon tofu stew was average - I found it oddly sour in flavour, not much in the way of veggies in it.",0
285,"We had the dinner followed by the show. The staff were very nice but the food was not to our taste and pricey and I eat Korean food. The show on the other hand was entertaining and made the night. If my friends go later, I tell them to do the show only.",0
286,"This bar came highly recommended from a workmate of mine so all my workmates were keen to see if it lived up to it's expectations .I can say without a shadow of a doubt it is a fantastic little place . The owner Warren is the consummate host, he delights in serving some fine local and imported craft beers and makes wicked cocktails ( thanks for the hangover )
Looking forward to popping back to Cinders in Songdo to catch up with Warren not looking forward to the hangover .. 5 stars ..",1
287,"I probably picked the wrong items since this place seems to be known for their traditional Korean soup.  I was disappointed in the lack of ban chan, it's pretty much kim chi and kim chi radishes.  We also ordered the cold noodles, which was pretty average to me and the kalb short ribs.  The kalbi short ribs seemed really overpriced given the portion.  Honestly, not sure if I would come here again, but if we do we'll come in the winter and try the hot soup.",0
288,"Had an overnight layover in Incheon and was looking for a spot to get out of the airport as we had a room at the transit hotel. After getting a stamp on our boarding card from the airline (needed!), we were allowed to leave the airport. Warren, the owner, gave our Uber driver directions on how to get to the bar (20 min from the airport). Kitchen open late for fish/chips and wings. Great alcohol selection (IPA imported from the U.S. on tap!) Great spot and will come back next time we have an overnight layover on Delta or Korean Air. Great mix of locals and expats. A must see on the the way through.",1
289,This is the first time I patronise this restaurant and what I liked was when they cooked the ramen inside the wok which reminded me of my favourite Mee Goreng back home. We had half the wok with spicy and the other half with marinated chicken separated by cheese right in the middle.,1
290,"Food was good. Service was sub-par. The gal behind the bar today had a real attitude. At one point there were customers trying to get her attention, I said mam, excuse me she looked at me and I told her these folks are trying to get your attention. She looked at them and said I hear you I will be with you in a minute. If you Hear someone acknowledge them, or go sit in a cubicle somewhere. If you're that bothered by a customer that was not being rude they weren't for sure if you heard them, then you're in the wrong field.  It's sad to see we get this desperate for help now that we allow people like this to interact with customers. This is the type of thing that customers won't come back again over. Thanks to the gentlemen at t lie grill. They did an amazing job and helped us with everything and cooked to perfection. Unfortunately the rude service has to kill the review.",0
291,"We had been recommended to Maru by a friend so we went to check it out. It wasn't very busy and there were only a few tables occupied in the dining room. We were taken to our table by the hostess and then continued to sit there for 15 minutes while servers kept busy all around us. At about the 25 minute mark of sitting their with our menus without even being offered water or addressed by a server we left. Regardless of how good their food might be, that level or lack of service is completely unacceptable.  Instead we opted for Swish, the excellent Shabu-Shabu place around the corner. If you want to take your chances, go ahead but we will NEVER go back.",0
292,"Worst Korean Restaurant ever visited:
1. It's in a super shady place and look wise is not good to your eyes at all.
2. Food was below mediocre. I'd say it was edible.
3. Tables were not cleaned properly. Was little sticky. I mean just Eww.
4. To make it worst, the service was just terrible. It seems like we came to prison to have our dinner and got treated like prisoners who just commuted a murder. So I tipped him just 8% instead of usual 20% I do.
5. To make it more worst, the waiter didn't like I tipped him 8% and started shouting at me in Korean accent. Lol. The manager was there and he didn't even bother that 1 of his guys was shouting at a customer. I mean just wow. 
I wish I could give negative stars to this place. But 1 would work here for now. 
You guys can seriously avoid this place in future!
Thanks!",0
293,"Had Yoongane twice during our visit to Korea (just 3 days)and the food was great! Excellent experience. Tasty food, big portions and very cheap! Service is good. Staff really helped us to cook the food. I think English maybe the factor people think they are rude but, they’re NOT.",1
294,The place is small and kind of dirty. The staff is rude. And there is not much to eat for lunch.,0

297,"I have travelled all over the world, been to countless bars, pubs, and restaurants..

The best way to describe the Cinder Bar is it's all of the above wrapped into a perfect little package of great times, exceptional drinks and tasty food, all in a warm, extremely welcoming atmosphere!!

Warren, and the entire staff at the Cinder are excellent people and extremely personable. They will go above and beyond to ensure that if you arrive a stranger, you'll certainly leave as a friend. This is clearly evident by patrons who return time after time again.

These people, this place is clearly special, and truly one in a million!!

Hope to see you at the Cinder Bar soon!

298,"Cinder Bar is the best place in Songdo to chill out, meet new people, and enjoy some quality international beers. Oh wait, did I mention they also make the best burger in town?!

Cinder is run by absolute legend Warren, along with his mate Sam. These guys are hard-working, honest Kiwi blokes who always put their customers first. Warren even arranged free tickets to the baseball for me!

I’ve spent the past 6 months living in Songdo and visiting this bar on a semi-frequent basis. When I moved here I didn’t know anybody. Now I’m leaving Korea and most of the people I know have all been Cinder Bar contacts through Warren.

They show the baseball, rugby and many other sports, not to mention live bands and quiz nights. This place has all the hallmarks of a western style bar, but with a genuine Korean welcome.

Highly recommend you pay a visit any day of the week - oh and say hi to Warren and Sam for me!

Keep up the good work lads!",1
299,"I had gyoza which was very good. My husband wanted Korean food, so he had a Bento box with beef and dumplings. His beef was supposed to be ""thinly sliced"" beef, but it was hamburger without seasonings. His dumplings were severely burnt nearly inedible. The salad was a bit of iceberg lettuce with no dressing. The white rice was harmless. When the manager (owner?) asked how our food was, we told him. He was rude and surly and followed us out the door and stood outside watching us as we drove away. I felt sorry for the little waitress, but no one should go there.",0

301,"I don't really give reviews online, but I believe visitors should stay away from this restaurant, as my experience was totally disappointing.

My wife and I went to Seoul in October 2015 for our honeymoon. Although we haven't been to South Korea before, we do enjoy plenty of authentic Korean food in Sydney.

We picked this restaurant as we saw the good reviews on the internet. However, we were extremely disappointed after having the Royal Cuisine.

Before visiting the restaurant, I made a booking via email and to make sure we could have the ""Royal Meal"". Although I've got a response saying food did not need to be ordered in advance, I was told at the restaurant that ""Royal Meal"" need to be ordered in advance...

I admit that the service was good, and good service is common in Seoul, but the food was extremely bad. The meat was rough and the food was cold. We were expecting authentic traditional Korean food, but we ended up having some westernised/fusion dishes...

The meal was a disaster not only because of the low quality of the food, but also the environment. We were lead into a room where all foreigners dinning together, while I saw Koreans were allowed to dined in spacious traditional rooms.

For all the unpleasant hours I spent in this restaurant, I was charged $350 AUD for a 4-person meal. That is very unreasonable for the quality of food provided, as a good Korean Bulgogi (BBQ) dinner for 2-person would cost less than $100 AUD in Seoul...

That said, Seoul is a great modern city and I really enjoyed staying there. This was a bad experience, but other local restaurants I've been to were extremely good. I believe this place was setup to rip off tourists...

For visitors who's travelling to South Korea and looking for a Royal Cuisine, please look somewhere else and stay away from this restaurant!",0
302,"Best place to hang out in incheon! Good beers and good shots! staff is super friendly, we will come again for sure!!",1
303,"The quality of the food has gone down so bad!
I usually go to the hwy 7 location  which in my memory is still okay.

I ordered beef and the beef came up looked like pork and the color is not red.see the picture.  Thought it was a mistake so ordered one extra plate same stuff came up.
The beef used to be thin and we'll marinated in my memory but now it just tasted weird.
Side dish is another horror story especially the soup . Tasted like it's been in the outside for couple days and just been re-heated.

What happened?
Just gonna go to Chako next time.",0

305,"A place full of buzz with an extensive, well-described menu catering for a whole range of tastes. The service was first-rate - helpful explanations given and an attentiveness that was never over-bearing. The menu allows for lots of welcome experimentation, First-class overall,",1
306,"I've been to this restaurant about five times over the last year or so and I can confidently say the the following three things have been consistent every time
- The food was nice enough
- The price was more than I'd expect
- The service was rushed and bordering unpleasant

I can explain a little more.

On points 1 & 2 - the food is OK, authentic - can't say, nice enough- yes. But overpriced. Within a few minutes walk of this place you can have the same quality Korean food at a much reasonable price.

On point 3 -
The space is very limited and that's fine but to be asked to wait until ""the rest of your party arrives"" before you are given a table ""because they don't want to lose a seat"" is not something I want to do. To me that tells me I am valued less than the restaurant selling a table/seat. I accept that this could be perfectly fine for many but is not for me.

Overall average is the best I can give this place and I'm aiming not to visit again.",0

310,"This place looks nice and clean, but looks can be deceiving. 
I found 3 long black hairs in 3 separate dishes! 
I almost gagged! 
At the beginning of our meal the all you can eat BBQ food looked clean and fresh, but as we kept ordering more and more dishes it started to come out looking as if it was meat that someone ordered and didn't want anymore so they gave it to us....
The dishes were dirty, the food has weird dirt on it and I kept finding long black hairs INSIDE the salmon, radish and in the chicken!!!

The washrooms are old and run down. The toilets weren't flushed and disgusting!

They automatically added a 13% tip and 1$ charge to use the debit machine.

313,"This place is amazing, to say the least. We'd never been to a Korean bbq before so didn't know what to expect, but what a great experience it was and we had such a great time. we ordered beef slices, king prawns, seaweed, two portions of rice and two grape juices; all of this coming with free sides and sauces. The beef and prawns were beautifully marinated and the staff was very helpful in showing us how to cook as it was our first time. The rice was excellent and the seaweed was as well (despite not liking it much myself). Would highly recommend getting the grape juice as well if you're looking for something non-alcoholic, tasted great and even had little grapes inside the can which added to the experience of a different culture. Overall, I must say that this place is a true wonder, with a great variety of food, friendly staff and excellent little details such as the metal chopsticks and drinks being served in their original can/bottle covered in Korean/Japanese writing; and for a very filling meal we only spent £30.",1
314,"I'd been to Korea House a number of times in the 11 years I lived in the Orlando area. As with any Korean restaurant, they stick to real Korean food. There is no Americanization for any reason. If you don't like spicy food (and I don't mean spicy like Mexican food--that's mild, actually), you're probably better to go somewhere else, but there are a couple of options safe for non-Koreans.

I travelled to the Orlando area a few days ago for the first time in four years. I got together with 3 friends and we visited Korea House. They've resolved a lot of situations since moving to the newer location north of Rangeline Road. The service was quite good. They've installed vents over a few tables to allow for Korean BBQ. Korean BBQ is where you choose ingredients and cook it at your own table.

The friends chose Gal Bi, Bul Gogi, and Pork Bul Gogi. I chose Dae Gu Jji Gae. They really, really liked the food, and being Caucasians, they don't have much experience with real Asian food. That's not a criticism--it's a fact, when places like P.F. Chang's represents itself as real Chinese food, what can you think?

I was thrilled with my Dae Gu Jji Gae, but I really dislike the fish bones. I know what's going to happen. They don't remove the meat of the fish and put it in the pot to cook. They put the fish in the pot in pieces, including the bones. Cod is typically bony anyway, so it was a good-bad choice. I scooped a bit of the broth into another bowl and let the three of them try it. They were especially surprised when I told them that it was medium spicy for real Asian food.

We had a good visit and a good meal. Korea House's owners--a family of four--care a lot about food and people. They really want you to have food you'll always love. It shows!",1
315,Out in Edinburgh for a gig and decided to try something a wee bit different than the usual pub grub and have to say I was very impressed with what was our first ever Korean BBQ. We went for the the BBQ set meal D for 2 which came with to beers and prices at £38:80 was great value for what was served up. The only thing that we made a mistake on was not ordering side dishes of rice/noodles as wasn’t sure what the set meal came with..lol the Wee bbq plate in the middle of the table was quick to heat up and did not make the dining area to hot to enjoy your meal. The marinaded beef slice was outstanding and watch out for the chicken as it’s bloody spicy (well for my mouth anyway..lol) this restaurant is very busy and we were lucky to get a table for 2 not long after opening time so I would suggest phoning to make a reservation to make sure you’re not disappointed..,1
316,"I've never felt so unwelcome at any restaurant in my life. In 5 minutes it became apparent the money grabbing philosophy in which they work, so I didn't even get to sit down.

First of, when I arrived a party of 4 arrived behind me. The waiter didn't even look at me and got them a table first. I attempted to speak out but neither waiter or customers were bothered.

But the worse part came next, when I finally got some attention, I asked for a table for 1. The waiter said at the moment they only had the counter which is just next to the door. As this was the windiest and rainiest day of the last month, I said I'd prefer not to. I wanted a small table. This was flat out refused. When I asked why I couldn't get a table, the waiter said if a party of 2 comes then they always have priority. Mind you, no one was waiting behind me at this point and I still got told I could only get my table an hour later when for them it was unlikely to be able to fill it up with 2 people.

Such short-sighted vision to customer service can only be from team orders and not a one-time experience. This made me leave straight away with the promise of never returning.

I'm in restaurants all the time because of work and this is the first time anything remotely similar happened to me. Bad service might not translate directly to bad food in the short run but it will eventually catch up and they will lose their customers. Unacceptable.",0
317,"Other Korean restaurants in Edinburgh require reservations if you want to use the grill. Korean BBQ was open for an impromptu visit and we were the only diners at 2pm in the afternoon. We had the mixed meat platter for two and a couple of side dishes. The food was tasty and fresh, and the homemade kimchi was excellent. We will definitely be going back and this time we'll bring the whole family.And I'll be recommending Korean BBQ to everyone I know",1
318,"Although it is an electric bbq in the centre of the table, this is still a great experience. Good menu with choices with selections for two that was adequate for three of us. Food comes raw and you cook it yourself to your liking. The grill is changed regularly so you don’t have to deal with burnt scraps. Although the waiter was attentive in that respect, they were a bit slow with us having to ask to clear the table, ask for the dessert menu, ask to order our dessert and then ask for the bill only to have go to the counter to pay in order to get our taxi. However, would still recommend that you give it a try.",1
319,"Had some higher expectations coming here, having read they serve really good tofu soup and was in the mood for some in the cold weather. Ordered the spicy tofu soup, which was bland and a little disappointing. I probably wouldn't have given them a higher rating if my expectations were lower though.",0
320,"The food quality is excellent. But more interestingly is the multi-talented waitress. They were wearing similar dress, and they are very beautiful. These waitress serve dishes for you and then they skillfully perform sing, dance, and play band! Amazing.",1

322,Very small portions and costly. Charged 55 c more just becaused we asked them to make it spicier.  Place definitely fails a health check. 7pm place looks deserted. Will not be returning for sure.,0
323,"Came here the third time. Last twice ordered bimbimbap which is nice, however, what i order today, the teriyaki chicken udon was too salty. Doesnt really taste the chicken and udon but the salty sause. Small restaurant which not recommend for a bunch of peoples( more than 4 peoples).",0
324,"The experience is fun, I love Korean BBQs and grilling my own food on the table. This particular Korean BBQ isn't the best, the service is very basic, and the wait time can get ridiculous without a reservation. The food though is served very quickly. If you've been to different Korean BBQs before you will find that this one isn't the best but I like that we can eat outside during the summer.",0
325,The servers in this resto are very rude! We decided to leave the restaurant instead of looking at their crappy faces and rude attitude. Whats so good about this resto that servers are allowed to provide an attitude to its customers. DO NOT EAT HERE. There are alot of dak galbi around the area that far better than others.,0
326,"If you are homesick as an ex pat then this is the bar for you meet up your buddies or even Korean friends. It’s lively friendly and good priced with great selection of local
Microbrews as well as international

327,"Had an early flight so layed over in the normal awful airport hotels. I arrived late all the hotel bars were shut. Found this place just round the corner. What a gem. Beer food atmosphere, perfect. Next layover in Seoul ICN airport .... Head here. Also they have Sweetwater 420.",1
328,"We have never tried Korean food so were looking forward to tasting something different.
We were greated and seated quickly and then informed they only accept cash, i wonder why that is??
The service was terrible, staff who couldn't care less. The food came out in dribs and srabs over 15 minutes. Mains first and then 15 mins later the rice. Useless.
I wouldn't recommend Miss Korea ever.",0
329,"After eating  at 2 korean restaurants (  an all you can eat Seoul Chakos among other ), i went to Tianxia and i was pleased.

Not only this restaurant is cheaper ( 22 $ with a soft  drink ) than Seoul Chakos the meats are better and the small portions are best for me as you can taste lots of things. 

Good meat variety (Ox, chicken, lamb), and a few sea foods (shrimp and salmon) are available.

Like all the Korean all you can eat you cooked your meat directly on your table.

Just make sure you're really hungry before you went to this restaurant and you'll be pleasantly pleased.

As for a korean all you can eat restaurant  this is perfect for me ! And it's in downtown Montr챕al  ! 

For a more sophisticated decoration and food (for a date) i'll suggest you went to Atti on university street. But among friend it's the best korean restaurant around !

Fran챌ais : Apr챔s avoir manger dans 2 restaurant Cor챕en (dont un all you can eat le Seoul Chakos). J'ai 챕t챕 agr챕ablement surpris au restaurant Tianxia, les viandes sont plus tendres et le prix est abordable 22$ avec une boisson gazeuse. 

Les petites portions nous permettent de gouter plusieurs vari챕t챕s de viandes (poulet, boeuf, agneau ) et quelques fruits de mer (crevette, saumon) sont offert au menu.

Comme tous les (tous ce que vous pouvez manger) vous cuisez sur votre table les viandes que vous apporte la serveuse. 

Assurer-vous d'avoir faim avant d'aller 횪 ce restaurant et j'en suis persuad챕 vous serez agr챕ablement surpris  !

Le d챕cor est simple mais de bon go청t, et le personnel est courtois !

Le meilleur buffet cor챕en 횪 Montr챕al selon moi ! Et en plus situ챕 au centre-ville de Montr챕al!

Pour un d챕cor plus agr챕able et un menu plus sophistiqu챕 (pour une date par exemple) je vous sugg챔re le restaurant ATTI sur university .

 Mais pour une bouffe entre amis Tianxi  est parfait !",0
330,"***!!!!!***WARNING TO ALL WHO WON'T/CAN'T EAT BLOOD***!!!***!!!**
This is a great restaurant, my friends and I were all very happy with everything EXCEPT one thing. HANGOVER SOUP!!! It tastes great, however it contains large chunks of jellied Ox Blood. I ordered it not knowing what was in it. It highly offensive to me to eat blood as I see that it violates bible commands at Deuteronomy 12:23 and Acts 15:20,29. Other than that I loved the KimChee, the radishes are amazing. Literally the best Kimchee I've ever had. The restaurant has a very authentic feel and the workers are all Korean and there is even Korean TV playing in the dining room. I only can wish that they would have had a warning about the Blood as I had no idea when I ordered. (didn't find out until I had eaten half of it!)...I did of course inform the waitress about the need to have it disclosed on the menu and she seemed very accommodating.",0
331,"Good little Korean place at Yonge and Sheppard. We went as a group of 7 and ordered 5 portions of the cheesey chicken with add ons of rice cake, more cheese and ramen. 

I love the flavor cause it's spicy enough without me having to drink water after every bite. One thing is.... Lots of cabbage in the dish. I don't mind cause I love cabbage but my friend was picking then out and he had a bowl full of them lol 

Service was a bit slow even though it wasn't that busy. We asked for a refill on side dishes which took a long time to arrive and we had to ask 3 times. It also takes a while for the dishes to arrive so this wouldn't be a good place to go if you're in a rush. 

Prices are okay and the food is okay good. Nothing really wowed me but I would go back for some cheesey chicken and noodles if I was in the area.",0
332,The menu needs better descriptions 1st time customers do not understand dishes with just titles. The staff seem to rush to explain the menu. The Kimchi was the best part of the meal. Service was slow and I had to ask for refills on my ice tea. May or may not go back.,0
333,This was the first time I came here. We were just walking and decided to try. The service started a bit slow but the food was delicious. Very good food here and I recommend this place,1
334,"Absolutely loved this place. Got there with my wife just as it opened, which was good since it is tiny and only seats around a dozen. 

The owners were friendly. The food was good with a nice spice level. It was very filling. 

The only quibble I had was that I would appreciate if the menu was a little more descriptive of what the dishes were, since I'm not familiar with Korean food.",0
335,"I have missed Samgyupsal since leaving Korea. So far, this is the best restaurant that I have found serving this dish. I have been a few times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I was shocked at paying for my side dishes after having lived the Korean way where this is all free, but the price was worth it. Would definitely go again!",1
336,I had a great experience at The Cinder Bar. The drinks were great and the service was even better. I highly recommend visiting if you are in the area!,1
337,"I was out for lunch and decided I wanted sushi. I thought about places nearby that served sushi and decided on I Love Korea. I had not been there recently so I was unaware if any changes had been made. As I entered the parking lot I noticed that the main business sign still prominently displayed "" Sushi Bar "". I went in and was immediately seated as there were not many customers. I was given a menu and no sushi was on it. I asked a server and was told they did not do sushi anymore. As it was lunch I did not have time to go elsewhere so I ordered a spicy chicken box. The chicken was passable but I've had much better at other Korean or Vietnamese restaurants in town. The accompanying dishes were for the most part not very good. No sauce was served with the stuffed dumpling as you usually see. Service was okay but nothing was making up for the false advertising and mediocre food. You can get much better Korean at a better lunch price at several places in Huntsville. As I left I took another look at the sign to make sure I wasn't crazy. Nope, it still said "" Sushi Bar """,0
338,"The food was only so-so for me. The prices were not worth the meal. It was also much too crowded.  I feel sorry for the busy waiters  For individuals with a smaller appetite,  this might be a nice place to warm up.  I don't  recommend it.",0
339,"First off, i want to start by mentionning that i went here for lunch around 2pm ! Apparently its very different from dinner. Nonetheless i somewhat like it, here`s the gist : Fun & classy deco with comfortable dinner type/lounge benches - big wide tables & cool blueish/eclectic lighting .
 
How it works : you sit down, look at the menu & write down on a little note pad available to you on the table with pencils, the number of the item of foods you want & their quantity. Example : Lets say grilled beef is numer 15 on the menu, you write down 15 & next to it 1 or 2 depending on the portion you want !
You can choose a variety of meats, vegetables & entrees such as samosas , spring rolls & sushis . There is also desserts , i had some mango ice cream , it was great ! However i felt like their wasnt enough variety, your typical beef, pork or chicken , some vegetables & a select few entrees...but i was told it was for the lunch menu & that for dinner, it was much more complete with things like sea food & many other vegetables addded. 
All in all the food had great taste & it was fun to grill it yourself while chatting up with a friend, the meats cooked pretty quickly , and i like mine very well cooked not bloody at all.

So i'm defnitely curious to go back for Dinner. Oh also, i went there with a friend but i think it would be much more fun as a group ! 

Only down side was that i felt a little rushed by the waiters & they seemed pretty hyper & in a hurry. But i later found out that it was because the restaurant closes from 3 to 5 i think, to switch from lunch to dinner time. Still it made the experience less enjoyable",0
340,"The food was fresh, good value and really tasty. The restaurant is on the edge of China Town. It is clean, tidy and pleasant. Waitress was friendly, polite and attentive. It has a car park directly opposite.",1
341,"Having eaten Korean before, on a visit to Hong Kong. I knew roughly what to expect. Marinated meat dishes to be cooked on a hot grill thing in the centre of the table and Kimchi, the ubiquitous Korean cabbage pickle. And so it was! Delicious! Must go back!",1
342,"If you want to have a great time in Incheon and you are foreign, you should came.to cinder bar ot's a great place to be and have a great time.
Music is awesome you can meet people from all around, and Warren and his staff are super welcoming!! They ALSO introduced me to some Spanish speaking guests who are now my new friends for the next three months while I am here in Korea here for business. Thank you, Cinder bar!br///// Si desean pasar un ageadable momento en Incheon deben venir a este bar, la musica es espectacular y Warren (El dueño) es extremadamente amable, conoce a la gente del bar y te puede presentar a personas que hablan tu idioma.",1
343,"Went in for lunch and had an amazing time.
Recommending getting menu number 3 if you are really hungry, however getting a Bibimbap per person will suffice",0
344,"Really bad experience, don't waste your money here. Chinese folks serving bad Korean food. We were served a small rock-hard pajeon (savory pancake) that looked out of a box, it was so bad that none of us ate any after one bite. We sent it back but were still charged for it. The rest of our meal was just as disappointing, as it was for the only 2 other customers in the restaurant at peak hour. All the negative reviews are true and we suspect most of the five stars are fake.",0
345,"Service is so bad here, go to hai woon dai instead. First of all, the food here is very good. But I live 90 miles away and this is the 2nd time in a row I've been turned away! I called ahead since I was running behind and they said be there by 9:30 and it would be okay. I arrived at 9:20 and the owner still turned me away. The previous time I waited in line til 9:30 but was turned away even though I arrived at 9:00. I will NOT be back again. From now on I will go to hai woon dai where the food is just slightly less quality than that at Korea house IMO. But the hospitality at hai woon dai is worlds better. They remember me each time and I only eat at hai woon dai a few times per year.",0
346,"My husband went to pick up lunch and had a great experience. It was after normal lunch hours, so the owner took the time to walk him through the menu options (we were new to Korean food) and gave him a free cup of tea so he could thaw out a bit while the food was prepared. He ordered a bulgogi and a beef bibimbap. Both were delicious and the price was definitely right. We'll definitely try out more dishes in the future.",1
347,"Came here today to get some waffle fries. Waited in front of the counter for 5mins the the phone rang at the store. Instead of taking my order first or even a simple apology the employee answered the phone first despite me being there first.
Finally after I was acknowledged, I asked about there waffle fries and was disappointed to find out that they cook a vegetarian item waffle fries- potato) in oil fried with chicken.. That is big NO in food industry. Also I politely asked if they would make a fresh batch of waffle fries in fresh oil instead of the old chicken oil.. they refused. 
Moral of the story - do not trust a business that choose to put customer last. 
Fair warning folks.",0
348,"Avoid Avoid Avoid
The service received (or lack of) was disgraceful.. it was the worst I have ever received in any restaurant in the world.
After being made to feel extremely uncomfortable, we walked out not ordering anything, vowing never to return again ....
Do not bother spending your money and your time there. Plenty of other restaurants in Phnom Penh to choose from where you are treated with respect and courtesy, something this restaurant lacks",0
349,First time trying this spot. It was okay. My friends and I came here with an open mind. We heard great reviews from someone and thought we give it a try. The gyozas were okay. Nothing amazing about it. It tasted like the ones from the freezer bags at Gmart. The Korean Tacos with Bulgogi meat was a hit! I don't even think I saw anyone munch on it because it was gone all in one second. The tenders were okay...the spicy was overwhelming to some of us and not tasty at that. The soy garlic was not marinated enough. My favorite was the crab Avocado Ball app.,0
350,"The Cinder Bar completely bursts at the seams with good vibes, friendliness and spot on tunes.
So many memorable evenings have been had at this spot...with the hosts taking hospitality to the next level. The Fe Fi Fo Fum is the reigning cocktail with an incredible NZ flavour twist...its a must have, seriously buy it now!
If you have the away from home blues or want to neet a new crew stop on by and make this your new local, minutes morph into hours as you literally laugh and drink while attempting to sing and dance that night away.",1
351,I'd love to say this rating was about the food but never got that far. Arrived at 11:50 am on a Thursday.  Only 2 people sitting in the restaurant eating.   Was greeted abruptly and said I needed a table for 2 dine in. Was immediately told no matter what I ordered it would take 45 minutes to get our food because they were too busy.  The 4 people behind me went elsewhere as well. Sad.,0
352,"Great place to go if you're a group. There's a communal aspect to the eating experience as you share a grill with your friends. We went for a friend's birthday party: the staff was very pleasant and offered to cut and plate the cake. 
I'm not a big meat eater, but their beef cuts were to die for. If you're not a big fan of beef, you have a variety of other choices: white fish, shrimp, chicken, lamb (on Friday and weekends), squid, and so on. Vegetables and tofu are available for vegetarians, but this is definitely not a place where meat-abstinence is celebrated. Everything comes compartmentalized in cute black stackable bowls that are easy to pass around for everyone to dig in. 
Other choices include fried scallops, which looked somewhat cheap with a dot of plain mayo on each piece. Fried calamari reminds you that this is an all-you-can eat.
The mango ice cream tasted gritty, the flavour somewhat reminded me of penicillin. Green tea ice cream was okay.",0
353,Excellent place for G&Ts which feels a bit like a bubble somewhere outside South Korea - this is probably why so many expats hang around here. The owner is a very friendly guy and admittedly one of the best gin and tonic gurus east of London...,1
354,"First visit to a Korean restaurant I loved the chicken bibimbap (whatever the Korean name) recipe cooked in a hot stoneware bowl, but I was not very impressed with the kimchi it was not very tasteful. I was hoping it to be quite spicy hot as I’ve heard people talk about kimchi... so...",0
355,"I tried this restaurant afew days ago for dinner with my family. The food was not very fantastic, the staff speaks little english and mandarin. They charge by head count.
The manager was not very polite and he keeps coming to our table for order while we are still discussing what to order. He got no patient to explain how the price was charge untill the next table customer explained to us.
After we ordered the food, they will cook the food for us. Self service of the side dish, only pickle radish and cabbage. Overall taste of the food is nothing fantastic, stress manager, overall dining feeling is below average.",0
356,An amazing array of Korean dishes came to the table in no particular order as they were cooked - it made for an interesting meal. The restaurant is plain in decor and it doesn't need to make an effort as the food speaks for itself. It is BYO which makes it reasonably priced but not cheap. The food was spicy hot and flavoursome and we enjoyed all that we ordered.,0
357,"Been here several times. Love the night owl special which starts after 10pm. Normally they are pretty good with their hours but that changed last night. Called them during the day to find out as to when will they be closing on a Sunday of a long weekend and was informed that closing time will be 2am. Went for a movie and then drove straight to this location. Was in front of the restaurant at 12:30am only to realize that they have closed the restaurant for today, even though the hours posted on the main door states that the usual closing time for Sunday is 1am. So if you decide to pay visit to this place after 10pm I would probably call them a couple of times to verify the store hours.",0
358,They post a sign out front saying no fire arms aloud but allow the largest organized crime syndicate to roam free in their establishment with a gun on their hip. Shame on you,0
359,"Fantastic little find. Thought the food was excellent and service brilliant (especially for only 2 people covering a busy Friday night).

We had set menu 2 with meat and veg. Excellent value for money in both quantity and quality. Chefs are having their summer break soon, but will definitely be visiting again once they are back :)",1
360,"In a land of cookie cutter bars and franchises, this quaint bar stands out and demonstrates how to ""do it right"". Take all of the items from a normal bar, add a superior sampling of alcohol choices and a friendly staff who bring customer service to the next level. Mix these things together and you get a bar that performs, where the seats are always warm because nobody wants to leave. Awesome place. I'm glad it is in Songdo because if it were anywhere else, this place would have a line spilling out into the street and you'd never get a seat. The music is top notch as well.",1
361,"Accept cash only, long waiting time, pricey compared to other Korean restaurant nearby , no ventilation at the shop
Bad customer service, we asked whether we could change our seating area cause the sun keep facing at my seating area. Been refused and no apologies.

We were so disappointed with this simple request as there were still plenty of seating table available at that time. We have to end up take away all our foods and went to somewhere else to have our dinner!!!

Would not recommend and would not ever go there again!!!",0
362,"If you fancy Korean food in phnom penh this is the place. Decent food in aircon but a must see floor show (about 7pm). All singing, all dancing north Korean culture and propaganda! Top value entertainment on the quirky scale!",1
363,"I can totally understand the service complaints. As it is sometimes a hit and miss! However the Food is amazing, we go so much the lady in the kitchen starts cooking our soup before we've even ordered!! Amazing. I would say the Male Owner can add a bad vibe in there. The girls are much better when his absent. My review is based on the food which we love, and the girls do a great job as well as the chefs. Little Gem in birmingham",1
364,"We ate here twice already only problem here the owner they watching what meat we order and they slow it too after you already they keep asking u , you need more meat... after that happen we stop going because of that!! 
now we have a new spot AYCE  this place they will give u watever meat u want and not watching u while u eating!!!",0
365,"Warren and his team offer fantastic, personalised customer service. The happy hour specials are great, the cocktails made with care and a great selection of beers and ciders from around the world. We had the fish and chips a couple of times - very tasty! Warren makes a habit of learning the names of all his customers and really goes the extra mile to offer exceptional service. Thanks Warren and we hope to see you again someday soon!

Highly recommended!",1
366,"Sauce is tasty, but the chicken is far from premium. The meat itself was like eating an eraser.",0
367,went on a saturday night with some friends. Comfortable interior. Owner was very friendly and chatted with us how he came to make his beer selections. He has a very nice selection of beers. The best I have seen in Korea up to this point. The food we had was very good. I will return.,1
368,"Massively underwhelmed with this place. Very few bbqs actually worked, the food was honestly slightly dodgy ( although their veggie kimchi pancake and tofu were lovely but then again quite expensive for what they were ), the staff were rude and slow (only two tables were busy), and you cant pay with card. I had a really hot soup which was served with a metal spoon and burnt my tongue massively.",0
369,The staff was very friendly but it's just not my kind of food. The soup I ordered tasted dirty socks. Should give it a second chance but I just can't do it.,0
370,"Did spend my first dinner at Yoogane. My friend and I loved the food so much. The service, the taste, the affordable price (we bought duo package for 21,000 won and get plenty of chickens with two sauce). Located in the lovely Myeongdong, I will come back here again for sure.
Very recommended.",1
371,"I went last year when they first opened and had a very bad experience. The wait for being served was long and the food came separately which caused us to eat at separate times.
We went this time thinking the service would have improved by now but it hasn't. We were shown to the table after 5 minutes by the waitress whereas the owner chose to stand behind the bar watching. The first dish came half an hour later and still no sign of drinks. It was busy so it was understandable that the food would take awhile but we ordered around half 7 and only just had the main dishes served around half 8/9. The bbq was turned off so we asked the owner to check for us and then he told us the bbq on this table was broke and and he asked us to moved, I questioned him why it took them so long to let us know that and he blamed it on the waitress, he asked the waitresses and she confirmed that it wasn't brokenand then he pushed her away and got the kitchen to cook our meat inside. Overall it wasn't a very nice experience mainly because of the wait, service and also the food doesn't taste as good as Toppoki.",0
372,"me and my friends have a meal there, we order barbecue, the table is very small, the waitress who has the black with a stink face to order and service us. No smile no more words to introduce food.I found that the plate is very oily, I ask for tap water, but the staff said they don't provide tap water to Chinese. but the manager is Chinese. After dinner, we want to paid separately, pay cash and card together, the staff said we can't paid card less than 30 pound. the manager seems not happy to see us trouble her coz the bill. when we went out, our coats are smelly, Their kitchen is opened no window .",0
373,"I love this place stopped in the other night on my way home, the experience is always good, but Mike always puts it over the top, always friendly, remembers what you drink, takes care of you.  I think is a different vibe when he isn't there, still a good experience, but not as much fun.  He is a huge asset.   The food is too notch and you can't beat the quality or price.   Just a great experience.",0

375,"I started coming to Korea here 4 years ago to get aquainted with Korean cuisine and practice my very basic language skills before going overseas to visit my sister in Itaewon. The young man who took care of us was wonderful, and since they weren't busy during that visit he took a few moments to answer some questions and correct my pronunciation.
I had watched videos and read up on the variety of cultural dishes. The meal we were presented with was beyond what I could have hoped for. Everything tasted SO DAMN GOOD! When I was visiting South Korea and ordered the same things, I wasn't surprised that the quality & execution of the meals I received here were the same as in Seoul, etc.
Since my trip my husband and I go out to Korea House at least once every 6 months. Every visit is just as good as the last and the staff are always so polite. Sometimes they'll even make special training chopsticks for my boys.",1
376,"Warren and his team offer fantastic, personalised customer service. The happy hour specials are great, the cocktails made with care and a great selection of beers and ciders from around the world. We had the fish and chips a couple of times - very tasty! Warren makes a habit of learning the names of all his customers and really goes the extra mile to offer exceptional service. Thanks Warren and we hope to see you again someday soon!

Highly recommended!",1
377,"Who doesn't like K BBQ?? Here's a video I put together from last night's dinner at Arirang in Mesa. If I'm gonna be honest, I thought the meat was alright. I was pretty disappointed overall though. Only 4 side dishes were included: kimchi, bean sprouts, fish cakes, and seaweed (not sure cause I forgot to try it). Not only that, but they weren't very good. I know kimchi tastes better when it's fermented longer, but idk. This kimchi looked very old and didn't taste that great either. The fish cakes were also pretty bad. I had a feeling the fish cakes were possibly undercooked. On top of all that, there weren't any air vents which made it difficult to stay and eat. The entire restaurant was incredibly stuffy due to the smoke The good thing about this place is it's a bit more affordable compared to Manna or Gen. It's $14 per person for AYCE (all you can eat) during dinner (9pm-midnight). I believe the others charge about $20 per person���",0
378,"Overall food and service of waitresses were okay.
But the owner's attitude towards customers were not good at all.
He was bossy and rude to customers as he was treating his employees.",0
379,"Ordered Korean street platter, jajiangmyun
, and spicy bibimbap. The rice cake stick is amazing crispy,sweet and spicy. Noodles are super good too.bibimbap is not really worth the price as the spicy pork is not that tasty and the rice is a little under seasoning but crispy~",0
380,"Since moving to Korea in January 2017, this is by far the best spot in the area!! There is a great mix of local, expats and travelers passing through Incheon/Songdo leading to a ""never know who you might run into"" evening.

The location is a bit hidden for a first-timer, but that adds to the mystique. Once there, the interior is intimate and welcoming. There's also additional seating upstairs and a recently added dart machine for a fun competitive game with friends. And for spring and fall, there is outdoor seating as well (you will appreciate the air conditioning indoors during the Korean summer months!). Don't miss out on the monthly Trivia Night as well for a good time with co-workers or friends.

The food, with the recently expanded menu, is always great. Remember, the Cinder Bar is a bar, so the menu is very appropriate, but don't let that fool you in terms of quality and taste! My personal favorites are the colonel chicken sandwich and wings...which remind of wings from back in the US. The burger, fish sandwich, fish & chips and fries are also favorites and give a variety of choices. Cost is very reasonable and appropriate.

On to the beer....the Cinder Bar offers a dozen or so beers on tap and countless bottled beers. The tap selection is vast from Asia-Pac to Europe to US to local craft and includes many types (pilsner, stout, IPA, porter, wheat, etc.). The whiskey selection is also extensive with many of my favorite single malt Scotches!

And lastly, the services is always phenomenal, which is the main reason I return. Warren, the owner, and his staff are always welcoming to both regulars and first time visitors. He goes out of his way to introduce himself and get to know his patrons.

So if you've relocated to Songdo or happen to be passing through, I recommend an evening at the Cinder Bar.",1
381,"I would say that they dont really have much options , the service is great the place is beautiful but then the options were less .",0
382,"Nice bar, nice music, nice and friendly people, favorite place.
Just a few minutes walking from downtown area of Songdo,
Place fell cozy and makes you stay for another drink or so.....
Keep it same spirit Warren :)",1
383,"Firstly, the staff was very gracious and accommodating.:) They helped us with the menu because we weren't aware of the level of spiciness.

There was a salad bar where you can get the vegetables and kimchi. :)

The meat is as tender and as well-marinated. The level of spiciness is less than moderate, and it is more sweet than spicy actually. It was complemented by the vegetables and kimchi.
The chicken may be the main dish, but we also tried the seafood which was equally amazing and tasty.

Overall, I enjoyed Yoogane because of it's value for money, great dining experience, and the food of course. We came back regularly during our stay in Korea. :)",1
384,"We arrived few minutes after 22, they didn't allowed us in because kitchen closed at 22. We begged to enter because e were arriving from a six hour flight delay and we said anything to eat, even cold dishes would be fine. No way. Too late ( to be kind)",0
385,"Made the trip out and they were closed at 7pm. Everything says closes at 8pm.  No greeting, we just awkwardly stood there. A customer finally said they were closed. 
Really wanted to try this place with all the great reviews. It doesn't cost anything to be nice.  Next time I will call ahead.",0
386,"Contrary to previous reviews, the owner/server is friendly and efficient. He doesn't try to be your best friend, but that's not his job. He does see to it that your food arrives promptly, and that you have everything you need. I didn't need to wave him over for anything; all was foreseen. He checked several times during the meal, just in case.

I had the bento box with beef and dumplings, which proved quite tasty. It also included a cabbage side and rice. Unlike some Asian restaurants here, this one offers brown rice, a healthful plus.

The decor is a combination American country/Asian kitsch. The location is an easily-accessible strip mall with ample parking.

I will definitely return often, and I would encourage others to give it a try.",1
387,"I been coming to Miss Korea restaurant since late 2013 and every single time that I come here the food is consistent the standards are high the staff is friendly as well as helpful, there isn't much korean restaurants in Birmingham England this is a treat who want to try something different other than Chinese Japanese Indian or Thai food korean kimchi stew is very healthy kimchi itself is one of the healthiest foods on earth it based on fermentation of different vegetables the most popular one is with cabbage.",1
388,"Best wings in the world, the burgers are good too. Make sure you ring the bell for free drinks. The hangover is worth it.",1
389,"totally wrong food, there are all chinese staff. very disappointed. wasted time and money I will not go again.",0
390,"This Bar has the most amazing customer service, hands down. The drinks are reasonably price and as all the reviews continue to say the wings are out of this world. Warren is an amazing owner offering hotel pick up and customer service. After discovering Cinder Bar it became my go to spot. When you enter you are one of the family. Order the Hendricks and tonic amazingly prepared. Thank you Warren for making my Korea experience so amazing.",1
391,Absolutely lovely. The whole staff is really friendly. The best place to chill and have a beer with your mates.,1
392,"This was my first time here. I will be back but I definitely will be trying something different. I had the roasted garlic sauce on my meal and I didn't like it. It was to sweet and I'm not a fan of my food being sweet. Definitely will come back but won't try that. The shrimps also were super tiny, sliced beef is definitely the way to go.",0
393,"My year living in Songdo would have been very different without Cinder bar. Warren makes great drinks and the atmosphere is very relaxed with lots of friendly people. If you're in Incheon looking for a relaxed bar with great drinks, great people, and great food Cinder is the place to go!",1
394,"Came here for dinner after a Raptors game, because we were craving Korean bbq. I've been here a few times and it's okay, not amazing but not horrible.

To begin, the service is okay. I mean, there's a bunch of waiters that will be helping you out. Majority of them are nice, but make sure you look at what they are giving you, because sometimes they can get confused. However, the waiter did let us know that the tips were included, which is a huge plus because some Korean bbq places do not tell you.

The place itself is alright. I personally feel like it's so crowded in there that you can literally hear other people's conversations around you. Also, the washrooms are pretty gross! So I suggest you don't use it unless you really have to.

The food was alright. I personally loved the beef and thought it was the best to cook. Ribs were also good, but the beef was better. One sad thing is that this place does not have dessert, not even ice-cream!!",0
395,"This has Nothing to do with Korean Food. Rather, Its a Chinese misinterpretation of what they think Korean food is. Please dont go here. They dont even have the basics of Korean Barbecue:

Uses Bacon for Samgyupsarl

Marinated Meat does not taste anything Korean

No Lettuce for wrapping

No Samjang - Most important sauce for Korean BBQ

No Garlic or kimchi for side grilling. Instead they have some weird grilled Onion options which Koreans never do.

No dish, I mean '0' dishes in the menu thats Korean at all. Instead they have sushi options. 

They dont change the grill when it gets filthy with soot until you are finished. Average Korean bbq places would at least change it 2-3 times for one meal sitting. 

They even had the oddity of having their signage in Chinese but no Korean even if its a 'Korean' restaurant. 


The list goes on please dont go here. Im only giving 2 stars not 1, because it was not absolutely horrible. Although the prices are expensive.",0
396,"Cinder Bar is THEE expat bar to visit in Songdo/Incheon! Warren (the owner) never forgets a name... and pours the best gin and tonic you'll ever have! Great fish and chips, wings, and and awesome burger to enjoy with great craft beer. But best of all - a great group of people always gather at this cozy spot. Don't miss it!",1
397,Having heard good things we my girlfriend and I were excited to have dinner at Dain Korea last night. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. My Yaki Soba Chicken was distinctly lacking in chicken and was generally bland and tasteless and my girlfriend's spicy seafood soup was oily and didn't have much to it. This is one place we won't be going back to.,0
398,"Went here with family and the food tasted good but it wasn't anything special. First experience at a Korean BBQ restaurant and honestly, I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon. Not because it was all bad, just because I wasn't impressed. 

The staff was polite and nice, but water never got refilled (they only refilled out water after at least an hour of us being there). MANY of our orders were neglected and never came, so we had to reorder a second time only because we were missing most of our items. Price seemed fair considering it's an all-you-can-eat. 

My biggest issue was cleanliness. The table was not cleaned, or not very well at least. As we walked to our table we passed by the bar and lounge area that was a complete mess, with boxes and glass racks stacked against the wall everywhere, which is unexpected from this type of space and restaurant. Many of the food pieces would stay stuck on the grill as it was not non-stick. 

Overall I made the best of the experience, but unless your tastes aren't particularly perfect, I wouldn't recommend this place",0
399,Don't go there when you're hungry ! The restaurant is quite small so we had a long wait. We had the soup as recommended. The food is good but not remarkable!,0
400,"The Cinder Bar is basically a pub for the expat community. Their target is the very small foreign residents of the city, so you won't see many locals. Great variety of beers, and they often organize events for alcohol lovers.",1
401,"Famous for its stir-fried chicken in spicy sauce (Dak Galbi), this restaurant is always very packed whenever we visit. Lucky for us, we are able to get a seat quickly this time.

We ordered the mix set which comes in 2 portion - spicy and non-spicy. The spiciness of the spicy version is just right and the non-spicy version is marinated in a sweet sauce. Both taste exceptionally good especially when mixed with the generous amount of cheese. Higly recommended and definitely a restaurant of a great value.",1
402,Nice place with friendly staff. A good choice of menu options including korean bbq or dishes that are ready cooked. We opted for rice based dishes plus a selection of vegetable starters which were all tasty. This was our first Korean restaurant and the spicy fried chicken with rice is definitely a dish I would want again. Not expensive and very generous portions. I've no doubt we'll be back.,1
403,"Very excellent value!  We ordered the gangnam set for two people and the three of us could not finish. But better yet the six marinated meats inclusion filet mignonette and prime were especially excellent. Comes with bibimbap topped with bulgogie. 

Only little thing was some of the marinade and bibimbap were a little in the sweet side. 

Highly recommended

Oops. Wrong restaurant. Was meant for Gangnam",0
404,"It was recommended by locals as one of the best. It was good but still below our expectations. The spicey source was good for a chicken, but it killed the vegetables and mushrooms taste.",1
405,"Not welcoming, sat for 35mins, didn’t ask if we need help with the complex menu, no drinks offered, no do you need help, we got up and left, nobody asked us or approached us. We had no idea what we were doing, all we got was there is your seat there is your menu. Went to Miss Vietnam instead, it has started well already got our drinks.",0
406,"Went here shortly after 10pm for their late hour special and noticed that it is not $9.99 per adult anymore! They increased the price to $10.99 just recently. Tables were filling up really quickly and service was getting slower as there were only around 3 servers that night. Overall, I liked all the meats especially the beef and chicken as they were full of flavour from the marinade.",0
407,"I can't really say enough about this establishment. The atmosphere and the staff's enthusiasm makes this a ""must see"" while in Songdo. The food is great, the beer selection is spot on, and the conversation is second to none. I frequent this pub every time I travel to Korea. So, get off your duff and mosey on down to the Cinder Bar. Oh, and ask for the killer Cinder (gin) and Tonic.",1
408,"When we discovered this local, family-run Korean place 2 years ago it immediately became a big hit with our office - multiple trips per week to begin with, and then settling at a consistent weekly or fortnightly visit ever since. I would bring friends & family here when visiting the city for the weekend, and advocate people go out of their way even to seek it out. Their yangyeum chicken starter was to die for, their bibimbaps tasy, and their pork bulgogi especially good.

Unfortunately, my regular lunch pal and I have noticed a steady decline in portion size and food quality over the last 6 months or so, alongside a slow rise in prices. We have often remarked before while dining here, how pleased we are that this brilliant little friendly restaurant had not succumbed to the trend only too often seen at local establishments that gain popularity - that temptation to try to further increase profit margins by switching to cheaper cuts of meat, changing suppliers (and suffering a noticeable dip in quality), and getting stingy with portions. Unfortunately this has now happened.

First our beloved yangyeum chicken - previously so good that we had visited and ordered only two portions of this delicious starter each as our meals - was switched from a generous pile of easy-to-eat boneless chicken (thigh I'd guess?), to chicken wings instead - without any change to the menu I should add. Next, the generous portion was downsized to just 5 wings (tested on multiple occasions for consistency). And finally, the price was actually INCREASED.

Now many people very much enjoy chicken wings, so what's wrong with that, you might ask? Well, for the tourists who might wander in once on their visit to see Buckingham Palace, absolutely nothing. But for those living or working locally, we know better. We know what came before. And I'll tell you this for nothing - bitesize pieces of dark meat are far easier to eat cleanly with chopsticks while on an office lunch break or having a business meeting, than fiddly little battered wings smothered in a very sticky spicy-sweet sauce.

We've also observed a decrease in the bibimbap sizes, smaller portions of accompaniments, increased greasiness and lower quality of meats (e.g. the belly pork), and further subtle price increases across the menu.

I think we feel particularly strongly just because of how much love we had for this place initially, and what a stark contrast there is. The first time we went after they'd made the thigh to wing switch, the waiting staff actually apologized to us for the change when we ordered, knowing full well we'd be disappointed. Now, they simply look at us apologetically when we arrive in the doorway.

Sadly, while we've really been trying to keep coming, our regular visits may now have come to an end, the decline has crossed a threshold.

Like many of the best things in life, it seems it couldn't last forever.

TL;DR - if you're in town for the weekend, fancy some Korean and are in the area, you could do far worse than Lime Orange. If however you've been before and loved it, say a year ago or so - don't come back, you'll be sorely disappointed.",0
409,"Terrible service and too much customers that they cannot even control it themselves
They have left our menu for so long that our menu was all burnt on the bottom. We have argued about it to the staffs, but they were just like, Oh, that happens.

The worst place ever",0
410,"If you are in the Incheon area this place is a MUST. Warren and his team make sure that you enjoy your time there. Great people, food and reasonable drinks. The next time you come (because there will be a next time) they'll remember your name and they'll make you feel like you're at home. You won't regret coming to this cozy, welcoming, foreigner friendly bar. Go.",1
411,"I really debated in writing this review. I really did. Why? Because the food is good here. You get a lot of food for a reasonable cost and to me, that's an awesome deal. My friends told me that the chicken bowls here are great and I have to agree after getting my own chicken bowl. I ordered the chicken bowl with soy garlic sauce, which I thought would not be spicy, but it was a tad spicy, which worked well with the mayo they added on the top.
The reason why I can't rave any more about this place is the service. I haven't felt this uncomfortable in a long time. I came in and the guy who took my order, looked at me once, and looked disgusted. Then, he murmured a few questions, which was hard to hear, and since I responded incorrectly, he asked me again with an unfriendly tone. I don't understand why he treated me this way, but I was extremely uncomfortable and irritated. I don't know him and he doesn't know me. I didn't do anything to him nor did I even say anything to him. Maybe he was having a bad day, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be coming here again after that experience. It made me want to run out of there as fast as I can, which is a real pity since the food is good.",0
412,"Be sure to try the fried sesame leaves. Food was good, and at 8:00 a dancing and singing show started. It lasted about 35 minutes. I had expected propaganda because I heard there would be some, but there was not. Table service was OK but not great -- a bit difficult to get our waitress's attention.",0
413,"my mom and i went there and the cold noodle dish was horrible - the noodles were overcooked so that it was a pile of mush, not to mention that my order came about 20 minutes before my mother's and they kept telling us my mom's order was coming up -- i think they are still trying to figure out the service portion of this restaurant especially for Koreans... they are much better with their service to non-Korean, I felt. it would have been great to have a good Korean restaurant but this isn't it.",0
414,"Went there in a group of 5 adults and 2 children, they couldn't accommodate all of us on one table, we were split to 2 tables. They will insist each adult to have a serving even if one person said she is not hungry and won't be eating. Waitress arrived with cooking tray and was just banging everything. She had a grumpy face the whole time when she was cooking our food. Never mention to us to self serve our own side dishes, lucky we saw ourselves. Food was nothing special, the chicken galbi with vegetables had lots of cabbage and spring onions. The noodles were a bit burnt. Will not recommend this place, look for another chicken galbi place if you want to eat this food.",0
415,"Worth acceptable for the price... Lessons learned, better order good for 3 if you are 2:) serving seems small... best thing is that your food will be cooked in front of you.... bad thing is, different people/crew will cook because everyone is busy..in my side total of three different people touch my food...

420,"Mama must not be in the kitchen today. I`ve eaten at Ktown numerous of times, never had I said I will not return.

If you enjoy over seasoned food beyond explainable pallette, this is a place for you. Or if you happen to be sick, and have a dull taste bud.

Our table of 4 ordered Combo D which feeds 4 to 6 people.

First came the Jap chae. It had greens which I was impressed. All of us took a bit to try, and we all were wah. Super flavour. Not only rich in sesame, but black pepper. Lots and lots and lots of black pepper. Each 4 bites, we had to take a sip of tea. 

Second came the beef boiled dumplings. Standard flavour, smaller then some I had. It was the best dish for the night.

Next came a chicken stir fried rice. They used they purple rice, was a bit wet and soggy. But it was edible. If you ever try stir frying rice out of the cooker with lots of condensation, you will understand the texture.

Next came the LA Kalbi. It came sizzling, it came black, it came charcoal. We all wanted to try to meat and took a bit. It was hard! Burnt bits crumbled in our mouth. The meat was tough and over cook it existence. We tried to send it back. The waiter said this is ordinary. The meat was so over seasoned and wet when grilled that the soya sauce just became grits and burnts on meat. I had never seen LA Kalbi disappear so slow on the table.. no one wants it. The cow died in vain.

Lastly came a kimchi pork sizzling dish. It sizzle nice, but very sour. It taste extra fermented and full of brine sourness. Imagine drinking a spoonful of pickle brine for fun. That's the flavour of the whole dish.  Our table was defeated. We pick out some pork and ate it. We lost our appetite. 

To top it off, we had leftover refrigerated cold soggy pancake for compliment appetizers.

At least the guava candy tasted good.

Sorry mama. I will not be back. Even myself, I think my cooking tasted better",0
421,"Have you ever had a home cooked Korean meal? If not, this is just the place to go to! Before visiting this place, consider if you're eating in or doing takeout. The restaurant itself is extremely small with two tables and counter area. So if you're eating in, arrive early or call ahead for takeout. We went there on Friday night and were doing takeout. We got lucky that we got in before the crowd started arriving which still took at least 20 minutes for our food to be ready. The place is very cozy and free parking is always a plus.

The food itself is pretty decent. We ordered kim bop (sushi), kimchi chi gae, egg soup and bugolgi. The egg soup was delicious and filled with flavor. As for the kim bop, I did enjoy it but it was small and there were more veggies more than anything. I also like the kimchi chi gae which was a bit spicy but very well seasoned. The only downside is that everything had small portions for the price.",0
422,Sampled two dishes and could not bring myself to have another bite. One of the worst dinning experiences I have ever had.,0
423,"I came to Joon's again and ordered the DakGalBee for dinner with rice cakes, mozzarella cheese, and noodles, but this time with the original Joon's spicy sauce. As someone who cannot eat a lot of spicy food, I found the sauce spicy but at a tolerable level, unlike what other Yelpers have mentioned. However, it really complemented the dish better than the teriyaki sauce that I had last time. My friend who generally can eat spicy food didn't find the sauce spicy though, so I guess it's just a matter of preference.",0
424,"This is my first review. I have went to this Korean BBQ twice the first time it was amazing. Food was delicious and service was punctual. The second time there was one other table when I arrived. Me and my boyfriend sat down and waited 10 minutes for a menu. When we ordered what we wanted we received our food in 10 minutes and had to wait another just to get water, we asked for water 3 times. Our server kept asking what he was already told several times, we got our water about 20 minutes after walking in the door. Our server proceeded to move the other guest to a different table upon request. When we put in our second order with 3 different items to our first he came back with the same 2 times as our first order which we did not want, when we told him he never came back with our second order but came back which another tables order and we told him we didn't order it and he asked if we wanted to keep it. We denied. We never received our second order, never received service after denying the other guests food. We were at this restaurant for 1 hour and never got anything but water and our first round of food. As we left and asked to speak with a manager he told me that they would speak with me momentarily, I waited 30 minutes standing in the lobby and never actually got to speak with a manager but had my server complain about his job. If I were to recommend a Korean BBQ go to GEN Korean BBQ worth your time and money.",0
425,There is only one anser ; The Cinder Bar why? Its a great place because warren and his team are very friendly the food is nice especialy the wings the beer is fresh and the cocktails are awesome!!!,1
426,"Beautiful restaurant .....


BUT there's many things to improve upon. We arrived at 11:20 , there were only 2 other people dining at the time.  Took 5 minutes for our server to come to the table . Her customer service was kind but she didn't seem like she knew what she was doing . The manager did explain she is new . 

My biggest gripe was our food took so long to come out. My colleague ordered the lunch Pad Thai and I ordered the Pad See Ew. Both were ok, there wasn't anything to brag about with these two dishes. The sauce was typical, however ; for $11 you expect more and an accompaniment of other ingredients in the dish . To wait 40 minutes for your lunch only to be greated by 95%noodles is a huge turnoff. On top of that we never got any water refills . With this being a new restaurant it would've been useful for the owner or management staff to walk around and greet the guest , maybe then the long waits for service and food could've been addressed proactively. 

The manager apologized and treated us to the meals , because on top of the long wait our tickets were miscalculated.  I thought that was good service, but not enough to make me want to come back and try another dish. From what I viewed from the menu , the prices are too steep for the quantity and quality . I would only venture here again for a drink .",0
427,"My wife and I went here to try their late night ayce.  Only thing good was the price of $13.99 + taxes.  They use a paper ordering system for your ayce picks, customer marks how many of each item they wish.  For the late night offering, it is beef, chicken, pork, fish, squid & pork belly.  Drinks are extra @ $2.25 for aycd.  Wife and I selected chicken, pork and squid.  We filled out the paper 3 times and we never received our squid.  Our first order of chicken and pork was short of 1 tray each.  the Banchan (side dishes) were kinda sad to say the least..tried the tofu, sprouts, radish & Kimchee.  Didnt get enough the banchan servings were smaller than other places we have been to.  The first bowls of rice we were served were tasty..however the 2nd set of rice ordered was different.  Seemed like it was from a completely different batch or brand (was also hard).  

Also we tried to order from the regular menu..since we weren't really up for ayce that night..but due to the cook leaving early at 9pm..only the ayce was available.  Another downside..no dessert options as other KBBQ spots have.

Odds are we shall return to our go to spot for KBBQ (Chako).  We just wanted to try a different KBBQ spot.  Likely won't be back.  If they didn't mess up our order for squid and refill on the sprouts and tofu banchan I would have given 3 stars at least.  Would have given an additional 1/2 star if their seasonings/marinade on the chicken and the pork wasn't so salty.",0

The food is tasty and there is certainly no rush to take orders, deliver food and drink and to bring the bill.

431,"We are from the States so we have many Korean bbq places to choose from. We were a little nervous to try it, but the other reviews were positive. After a rough day of pulling suitcases up and down hills to get to our hotel, we had a delicious meal at this place. Food tasted fresh, staff was friendly and place was very clean. The only down side to this place and why I gave 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because they only took cash on the day we went. Not sure if this is a usual thing but they at least knew where the closest ATM machine was. Overall great place would definitely recommend it and would go back if we ever returned.",1

Korean BBQ was perfect as they brought suitable nibbles, then I had a pork belly kim chi soup with a side of rice (we took away) which was satisfyingly spicy and delicious. My son had chicken katsu (his favourite) and rice and said it was really good.
Service was lovely, small business, chef/owner, and great decor. Very reasonable price.
This little place is tucked at the side of the King's Theatre and so easy to miss, but don't. This food is perfect for pre-theatre as it's not heavy and so less likely to induce that post-supper soporific state so fatal in a darkened theatre space...
Definitely returning to do the whole BBQ thing.",1
434,"I haven't been back to eat at Kim Chi House for so long and decided to come and visit with my brothers and fiance. I remembered how cheap the food was and how the food was pretty decent for the price ($8-9 per meal). I was in for a suprise.

The prices are way higher now, ($10-20 per meal) which is not too bad if the food quality is good as well. I'm up for a bargain, but I tend to like food that is more worth the price. 

We ordered an orginal bibimbap, chicken bibimbap, and tonkatsu. The bibimbap dishes were good, but it wasn't worth it. The bibimbap dishes also came with miso soup, which was very plain and 2 side dishes. Again, it's nothing special and there weren't enough side dishes that came with them. The tonkatsu was very disappointing. They gave you rice, cabbage salad(some of the cabbage was turning black) and heated up frozen veggies that you could buy in any grocery store.

Okay, I wouldn't have complained a long time ago, because the prices were so cheap and the food was decent. But now I was suprised at how the quality of the dishes deteriorated! 

And trust me I have frequented this establishment since 2011 until 2014. So I guess for the 3 years I didn't visit them, all these changes happened. The only thing that didn't change was that they still only take cash, which is a total inconvenience.

I give them 2 stars for their good service, okay food, and for the free tea and water. Makes me sad that I will not be returning to Kim Chi House again probably for longer than 3 years.",0
435,93.5 health rating for a restaurant barely open for 6 months? Pitiful!  I'll be surprised if they make it through the spring.,0
436,"My friend and I ordered the AYCE which was $23.99 per person. The server gave us the menu and we checked off what we wanted. From past experience, it takes at most 5 minutes for them to bring the food out (chicken, beef, pork, etc), but this time we waited around 25 minutes, and there was still no food. We tried to make eye contact with the servers but they just ignored us until one of them came up, and asked if we filled out the order. When we said we did, he told us that they lost it, and asked us to fill out another order. In the meantime, they gave us pork, beef, chicken right away, so we didn't have to wait for a second order. Due to the poor service, we decided to take tips off but when the bill came, tips were already included (13%) and they don't mention it unless you had to analyze the bill. Also, the bathrooms are disgusting.",0
437,"You know why I'm here...I came for the wings. While I haven't tried much else on the menu besides the gyro and the philly, I must say the wings are finger licking good. I've never been disappointed with them. I tried their fried rice once, but it's nothing to rave about. My only complaint is the long wait time, but I guess that's the price you pay when your food is made fresh.",0
438,"Great bar friendly owner and staff, make you feel welcome, and will remember your name on your next visit. Cheers🍻",1
439,Most of customers are foreigners and they push you to order including for small kids.other places are more local and friendly,0
440,Two adults and two kids. Kids were not hungry so we wanted to just order food for 2 adults. But server said no. 4 seats. You must order minimum 3 orders. What a shame. We walked out. There are many other restaurants with a same menu nearby. Terrible attitude.,0
441,"Cinder bar has a great vibe and the owner Warren went out of his way to chat with us. The drinks were all made from scratch and were better than any other place that I have been to Incheon. If you are in Songdo, then this is definitely the place to go for good drinks and a good time.",1
442,"I guess I am not the only one experience the bad customer service...
Came here during lunch time but not peak hour yet. We wanted to order one set of the chicken galbi but the staff is so rude saying ' i said, this is for one person portion'. I asked politely whether we can share (just in case it was too spicy for us) & he repeat 'I said' more loudly. His face turn so sour & walk away. We have no choice but to order 2 person portion (6500 won times 2!). Turns out so spicy & made our stomach discomfort ....Couldn't even finish 1/4 portion of it. Chicken meat is so little in the set.
I would suggest to skip this rude & arrogant restaurant!",1
443,"Nice drafts beer selection, very expensive bar, in the day of ours visit, about of the half of the food manue was not available",1
444,"Great food, good service, and no line before show in October, but it was completely full when I left at 7 PM. The bibimbap is great, and plenty of food—would not have had room for appetizer, though they looked stellar on other tables",0
445,"While visiting Montreal I decided to stop by here with a group of friends for a quick late night dinner. We were promptly seated but as soon as we ordered our food the experience went downhill. 

After 10 minutes we were served a single bowl of edamame, allthewhile the table beside us recieved everything they ordered.
Another 20 minutes passed and we received bits of our order - a tray or two of meat here and there - but nothing close to our original order. We then flagged our server down and asked what was taking the food so long. He told us to reorder, which we though was weird, but we did anyway.

We were still waiting on things as simple as miso soup and rice after hitting the 45 minute mark. Then our server brought us a large lump of rice on a single plate for all five of us to share. Never have I ever been to a Korean BBQ restaurant where one plate of rice was given for multiple people to share instead of given individual bowls.

After over an hour of waiting, reordering, and still not getting all of our food we asked to speak to a manager. The manager came over and insisted he would get us our missing items within 30 seconds - this was not the case. We had to wait an additional five minutes to receive our miso soup, which contained NO tofu whatsoever!

After all of this inconvenience we finally received everything we ordered. Overall the food tasted great, but the service was absolutely horrible and I will not be returning. I would not recommend coming here during late night hours. I do not normally leave Yelp reviews however I had to after having such a bad experience here.",0
446,"My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful lunch here. We split the kimchi soup and deluxe combination. Our first taste of Korean food, and we were delighted with the new spices and tastes. To me the food was gourmet--high quality, lots of care. Seemed like very authentic food, dinnerware, decor, even music.
This is a small, family run restaurant. You feel like a guest in their home. Everything nice quality and gracious. Not inexpensive, but seemed worth it to us. Portions seemed just right--more would have been too much, and we never take home a doggie bag.
We look forward to eating here again.",1
447,Meeting a friend for lunch we thought we would try Lime Orange. When we arrived it was really busy but there was a table for 4 available so we sat ourselves down and waited to be served. After five minutes we were told that as there was only 2 of us we had to move and join the table behind us. We did ask if we could stay on our table and other people join us but they wanted to keep the table for 4 free just in case a party of 4 walked in. So we joined the other table (although the current occupants were a little taken aback) but there really was not much room for 4 and couldn’t talk freely. Then table for 2 became available so we moved to the free table. We were then told we couldn’t have this table as it had been reserved! So no one waiting. A table for 4 and a table for 2 unused but we could only join a table already occupied by 2 people. At the point we felt very unwelcome and decided to leave. My view on the food can’t be included but we definitively did not feel the love! Looking at other posts it seems we aren’t the only ones dissatisfied with their seating technique. If you want Korean food then give it a try but if there are just 2 or less in your party then find somewhere a bit more welcoming.,0
448,"So, last year I planned a surprise birthday party. I booked a room days before the event and found it strange that (1) the person did not reply with business name (2) the person was the owner and (3) it all reeked of sketchy-ness. I decided to go against my instinct and still booked the room.

I drove around that day to locate the spot and the sketchy feeling followed me as it was in the back-alley. Later that night we entered that same alley entrance and every step made me want to reconsider taking another step forward. But since we had friends waiting, we decided to make a night of it.

Sketchy. Everything was in Korean. Even the karoke machines. Drinks were good. We had a private room to ourselves and were left alone. Great location to set-up some major drug deals if you are into the drug-dealing bidness. When we left the end of the night, a little drunk and karokied out, the atmosphere was just as sketchy.

Yelp yelp and away.",0
449,"In the middle of Phnom Penh you'll find this strange place. The waitresses - all very beautiful and look exactly the same - are sent here from North Korea and stay for about three years. The purpose: to ""inform"" us about how fantastic there home country is.

The food was quite good, actually not so different from Cambodian food, but we avoided dog and some other strange dishes.

At 7.30 (this was on a Friday) the show started. All of a sudden our waitresses stopped serving food and got on stage. They danced something that reminded me of Sound of Music. And then they sang Honey, honey (Abba) and one of the played the violin good enough to get a job in any simphony orchestra. In the end they picked up three electric guitars and played.

The whole show was just so bizarre that we sat laughing all the time. We brought our three children and they didn't like the food so much but enjoyed the show.

Of course, you should not support the regime of North Korea. I feel a bit ashamed about it, but it really was an interesting experience.",1
450,"Wait staff is not very attentive. This restaurant is marketed as a traditional Korean restaurant. I lived in Korea, and this is NOT a traditional experience. The food is fair, but overall--no.",0
451,"Service is impeccable. The Galbi is just superb and the portion is excellent. The meat succulent. The taste is perfect. The kimchi is wonderful. If you love Korean food, there is only one place to go in the entire tri-County area. This is it.",1
452,"This one's a meh. This one's a nah. Really not up to snuff. And still, something to sneeze at.",0
453,"Not the greatest Korean food in Charlotte, but not bad - wait staff was good and helped to define food choices added bonus she had a great southern personality.",0
454,"There doesn't seem to be that many Korean places in Charlotte... I know of maybe 4 or so, and driving up to China Wing you'd never really guess this has some of awesome Korean fare. From the outside it looks like yet another crappy, MSG-ridden, over-sauced American-Chinese hell hole. Even when you walk inside, you're still not totally sold you walked into the right place... 

Boy, are YOU wrong for thinking that! I've been here twice and both times I've been very impressed by their Korean food. I don't know how their Chinese or American dishes are since I never get them, but the Korean dishes are great!

This time I had the Dolsot Bibimbap and it was very well serviced. The cute cashier asked me if I'd ever had it before, to which I lied and said no. She gave me a very nice and friendly lesson on the dish, the name and what it means all while practically prepping it for me and serving it. She stirred my pot (no pun intended) and suggested how to eat it and what not. Very nice.

Before my Bibimbap arrived they bring out a bowl of shredded chicken soup, some kimchi and this sweet pickled radish with sugar which was out of this world.

So, all in all, it was a great visit, great food, great service and great info.

But let's knock off a couple stars.

One because I've had better Korean food and because when you first walk in, you can get a little confused between the Chinese and Korean and hamburger signs on the wall.

The second star was lost (and I'm being nice here as I usually knock off two stars for this sin) because they serve you unfiltered water. I HATE IT when a restaurant serves me unfiltered water. It's disgusting and unclean and it can ruin your meal. I only took a sip and thought about sending it back. But figured the girl had been nice enough and the food was good enough that I could do without.",0
455,"I have travelled all over the world, been to countless bars, pubs, and restaurants..

The best way to describe the Cinder Bar is it's all of the above wrapped into a perfect little package of great times, exceptional drinks and tasty food, all in a warm, extremely welcoming atmosphere!!

Warren, and the entire staff at the Cinder are excellent people and extremely personable. They will go above and beyond to ensure that if you arrive a stranger, you'll certainly leave as a friend. This is clearly evident by patrons who return time after time again.

These people, this place is clearly special, and truly one in a million!!

457,"I'm in two minds about this place. Staff were friendly, it was packed and some of the food was very nice and the salads plentiful. The first time in the UK that I've tasted kimchi which actually had some kick to it. The pudding menu is very limited but some really unusual flavours - black sesame or red bean ice cream anyone? However some of the meat wasn't well cut & was therefore awkward on the barbeque and the overall value of the barbeque was poorer tan some I've had. Dishes arrived a little haphazardly and one a couple of times things were forgotten though came quickly after a prompt. Overall a pleasant evening but wouldn't go out of my way to come here again when there is so much other choice in the city.",0
458,"Must visit place if you are feeling lost in an alien land
Warren the owner is an excellent host
He and his wife manage this place and you always feel at home with them
I gave him a surprise by calling him by his name in first visit ( came to know thro the reviews ) but believe me he will remember your name even if you visit after a year
The beer is good so is the food nicely selected by warren and prepared by his wife",1
459,"I wasn't planning on Korean food during a short stay in Muscat but, it was right across the street from our hotel (Midan) and the good reviews here made it seem like a good bet. We were not disappointed! The service was very friendly and the atmosphere, while not fancy, was very clean and comfortable.

The marinated beef grilled at your table was tender and delicious (along with all the normal bitesize side dishes)! We had the mixed chicken and preferred the soy sauce to the sweet but, both were very good. The surprise best item was the ramen soup - a spicy (but not too) delight!

Would definitely go back!",1
460,"I came here with a friend on Saturday night. I ordered the pork bone soup and my friend ordered kimchi soup. I swear my pork bone soup went bad already. The moment the server put the soup on my table i already smelled the non-freshness. It smelled terrible! I tried a sip and it tasted really wrong! i told the server that the soup tasted weird. The server told me that's because they made the soup in the morning and kept it boiling for a whole day. I'm like OK, but this just taste wrong. Then he told me his boss tasted the soup and it tasted perfectly fine, and just left. Well I don't know what the owner eat every day that he thinks the soup that went wrong already taste fine, but i have a normal person's taste so I'm not OK with this shit. My friend's kimchi soup also tasted weird. The tofu in the soup definitely expired. 

Anyway I will never come to this place again and will not recommend it to anyone i know.",0
461,"Visited with some friends recently after we'd all come back from working in South Korea and were missing the food.

Stepping inside and first getting that aroma we felt instantly back in Busan!

First off the staff were incredibly friendly and took loads of time to speak to us and were always on hand with anything we needed - even showing the correct way to make a so-maek (?)

The food was outstanding and I honestly don't think you'll find a better representation of the BBQ atmosphere of Korean restaurants in Scotland, or even the rest of the UK for that matter.

We had the assorted meat platter with some soup and it was plenty for 4. We also got some kimchi and again it's much better than you can buy in the shops.

No Korean night out would be complete without some Hite and some Soju and thankfully they have both ;o)

All in all we had a great night there due to a combination of fantastically attentive staff
And delicious food all in a great relaxed atmosphere.

I can't wait to go back - it's my new favourite restaurant.",1
462,"Worst place I ever visited korean restaurant. They reuse green peppers and sauce from other table dont use. I complained but employee said they always collect uneatten food,wash in the water and give them to new tables... OMG.. I never visit this restaurant again.. I already report to health department....",0
463,"Tl;dr: stick with the classics and you're golden. Lots of hits and misses but it could shape up to be a great place. 

Atmosphere: 5/5

The place is really nicely decorated and the tables are comfy and roomy. It reminds me a lot of Asian KFC, which makes a lot of sense. The chairs are comfy and while there's a lot of places to sit, it's not too cluttered to navigate easily. I really like their wall art! It is loud so it might be kind of hard to hear at times. 

Menu: 3/5

Their menu is limited right now so double check your orders cause they might not have it in stock yet. There are some definite hits and misses. For example the Cheeseling is terrible but the Sweet Spicy and Original are great. Beware of things that don't look like the pictures provided. 

Quality: 4/5

Im taking an extra point off for how old and cold the Cheeseling my friend ordered was but the rest seemed pretty good in terms of quality. You can even see the steam when you break open a piece of chicken! The side dishes aren't worth it in my opinion, except for maybe the biscuit. Rice is mushy and Cole slaw is watery. 

Service: 2/5

Beware it is very,  very slow right now but hopefully once the employees get into the swing of things stuff picks up. I didn't take off any stars for the wait, which was hopefully a temporary thing. When I went on opening day, I waited about an hour for my order. The employees are nice enough and they're helpful, I just get the feeling they're under trained and under staffed right now.
Also,  I really wish they'd put the water dispenser as a self service thing,  same with plates (you don't default get any so you have to ask for them.) They have wet wipes with their condiments which is great cause you're gonna get messy.",0
464,"The food is good , the price wasn't bad at all 40$ for 3 people, we got 2 bowls and a alcoholic drink . We got 1 medium size bowl and 1 large bowl.

Other than that I would go back.",0

Gen has lower quality food.  Arirang also offers garlic and oil, which other Korean bbq's lack.  Also, I've waited for 20 minutes before at Gen to get water.  Though not being able to change the grill is a minor inconvenience, my overall experience was good.  

Unless you look for quantity over quality, I'd go here.",0

He dropped the plates so heavy. When we were eating they always come and ask do u finish. I guess because there were a line in front of the door.  Worst service and worst buffet! Never back!,0
475,My wife and I were at this restaurant around 3 in the afternoon. Was seated by staff waving in a general direction so we found some seats and sat down to look at the menu. After being over looked for close to 20 minutes even as we watched 3 other tables that arrived after us get served we decided to leave. We never got to eat but the sense we had was that we were being ignored on purpose because waiters were serving the tables immediately around us. So for service and attitude I strongly recommend people to not eat here. There are too many good restaurants around that deserve our business before this one.,0

My friends and I try out this restaurant because we saw ads on Facebook. Since we all love eating Korean BBQ we decided to give it a try. Taste wise is average. Price is reasonable. The grill is horrible, really do need more maintenance or even change a new one. All the meats that we order were cook with very low heat which dried it out when it's cooking (yes, we did turn the grill to highest heat). Also the kitchen takes a while to prepare meat dishes, so there was a long pause between each time that we put in order. We don't really enjoy the transition between service at all, and the restaurant really do need an improvement.",0

486,"3.75 stars

We came here for dinner a few weeks ago for AYCE Korean BBQ. We got here around 8pm and waited about 15 minutes for a table. The place was pretty busy and there were many groups of people dining. 

We ordered the following:
1) Appetizers: Miso soup, green salad, and kimchi. I recommend all of these appetizers. The serving size is small. We ordered kimchi three times since it was pretty good.
2) Meats: Sliced beef and short ribs. I preferred the sliced beef over the short ribs. Overall, both meats were good.
3) Seafood: Clams, fish fillet, and salmon. The fishes were a bit hard to cook since it would get stuck to the grill. I really like the clams and there are four small clams per order.
4) Vegetables: Onions and oyster mushrooms
5) A bowl of rice for each of us

We didn't order the ramen, fried rice, or sushi rolls since these items would probably make us full quicker. We mainly focused on getting the meat and seafood. We thought the food was pretty decent for the price ($24.99 CAD for Wednesday night, about ~$20 USD per person).

Service was a bit spotty for us. They missed some of appetizer orders in the beginning. It took awhile for the staff to clear out the empty plates from our table. Although, our waiter was very quick to change the grill top when we requested it. Overall, the food and dining experience wasn't that bad for us.",0

We especially love the fish and chips! We order it every time even if we were expecting to eat. Just check it out you won't be sorry.

The menu options are extremely limited and mostly ramen dishes (hence the name). The prices of their dishes are anywhere from $13+ and really feels like a ripoff when it's instant noodles with minimal veggies and meat.

Taste wise this place isn't bad but I'm really not feeling like there was any value ordering a $15 bowl of instant noodles. Most Korean restaurants also serve appetizers but this is not one of them.

After a day of shopping, you'll want to go somewhere else to get better value for your money. Avoid.",0
490,"I will begin by clarifying that I am not Korean, so I may have different tastes than other reviewers about E-Jo.  I ordered the Hangover Soup, and it was missing a certain something.  I added kimchi into it, and it was a bit better.  

The kimchi cabbage and the kimchi radish that accompany the meal were good, but it was not the best I have had.  Once again, I am not Korean, so maybe that's what authentic kimchi tastes like.  I have, however, had kimchi in Seoul airport before, and it did not taste like what E-Jo had to offer.   All in all, I don't think I'll be returning soon.",0

I would recommend to anyone looking to try Korean BBQ.",1
495,"Warren welcomed all of us and made us enjoy our time at The Cinder Bar!!
The chicken wings were amazing, so we had to go back there again thea same night for more wings!!
Thank you for your hospitality and kindness!^^",1
496,"J'adore les BBQ cor챕ens et depuis quelques temps, j'aper챌ois pleins de petits bouis-bouis qui fleurissent au centre-ville. Tant mieux, voil횪 une belle addition culinaire dans le circuit gourmand montr챕alais.

J'ai essay챕 ce buffet un mercredi midi, avec des amis. Le resto est assez r챕cent. L'ambiance 챕tait calme, peu de clients (il faut dire qu'il a fait 26 degr챕s 횪 l'ext챕rieur...), donc on pouvait bavarder en paix. La d챕coration est sobre. 

Le buffet est un prix fixe (la semaine le midi, c'챕tait 13,99 $ moins 10% de rabais du lundi au jeudi). Il y a un menu et on commande ce que l'on veut manger 횪 la serveuse. 

Le service 챕tait un peu mal organis챕 au d챕but, ce n'챕tait pas clair 횪 qui il fallait commander, car plusieurs employ챕s arrivaient avec les diff챕rents plats. Bon, pour nous, ce n'챕tait pas tr챔s grave, car on avait le temps. Mais je conseille de vous armer d'un peu de patience et de temps disponible si vous mangez l횪!


Petit b챕mol: primo, la laitue iceberg est 1,50$ en extra (pourquoi???) et les boissons (y compris le th챕 vert) ne sont pas incluses dans le prix du buffet. Secondo, il n'y a pas de shoju, un alcool pourtant typiquement cor챕en (????)

Petit plus: le prix qui est doux pour le porte-feuille et le fait que c'est un buffet 횪 volont챕. Parfait pour vos carnivores affam챕s pr챕f챕r챕s!

Est-ce que j'y retournerai? Probablement pas, car il y a tellement de restos dans ce coin-l횪 et que j'aimerais essayer. J'ai mang챕 dans de meilleurs restos cor챕ens ailleurs.",0
497,"I have so many problems with this place..... If I can give less than 1 star I totally would!

Problem #1. This place is listed to close at 1am. And 3am on Saturday. I came in at 1030....they told us last call for food at 11pm. Your sign says you close at 1am!

Problem #2. We asked for sisscors to cut the meat. They gave us a butter knife that was worse than a child's toy kitchen knife.

Problem #3. The staff is rude. When you ask for something they kind of just look at each other like you speak a foreign language.

Problem #4. The washroom there is disgusting. Doesn't look like it was cleaned EVER!

Problem #5. When trying to pay with a credit card. They charge you an extra fee! My bill was $130! And you are going to charge me an extra fee!!

Problem #6. I think they reuse the food because they did everything they can to make sure the food that wasn't touched didn't get dirty.... Gross.....

This place is disgusting and service and food was not worth your money. This place does NOT get a pass in my books. I will never give my hard earning money to this place.",0
498,"The Cinder Bar features some of the best mixed drinks I've ever tasted. Ask for the Gin and Tonic, or signature Long Island Ice Tea made with all top-shelf ingredients! The best part of this bar though is that Warren and his staff take time to get to know you. When you come back, they remember your name and you can practically pick up your last conversation where you left off, even if its been awhile. You feel like you're among friends from the moment you step through the door. Don't miss out on this great spot in Songdo!",1
499,"I was at a conference in Korea earlier this month and I was invited to this bar because one of the guys playing in the band was also at our conference. With other people from the conference, we went there and I had a great time. The music was great, the drinks were great and the vibe there was very chill and positive. Warren, who I think is the owner, was talking to us and making conversations with us and made us feel like we had been there before. If I ever go back to Korea, I'd definitely go there again.",1
500,"Not sure if this is the correct branch as there are many branches in Myeondong. Anyway, the food served are the same. Highly recommend tourists to have this in South Korea as it is really very cheap. My friend and I ordered a 2-pax portion for our dinner. When it came, we were shock as it was huge! The staff were very attentive and keep coming over to help us fry the chicken and making sure it's cooked before removing the metal ring fenced around the hotpot and shutting down the flame. It was very spicy but very yummy! The cheapest meal we had in South Korea for our whole trip. The meal only cost us around USD11! Super worth it, so its a 'MUST EAT' in South Korea as the same portion cost about USD20-30 back in our home country.",1
501,The worst Korean cuisine I've ever had. The waitress is not willing to change the baking tray even it's get severely charred.,0
502,"I was big fan of this place, and visited here again yesterday while staying in Vegas. I don't know what was happened at this place, but food wasn't good anymore. Soup was too mild, only small amount of meat was inside of soup, etc. Kimchi was still good, but food is not grest anymore. :( I don't know if I want to visit here in the future.",0
503,From the moment we walked through the door of the Cinder Bar we were made to feel like Family. It was the most fun we've had at night here in Songdo - Icheon South Korea. The food is truely amazing. Oh and the beer was awesome of course. We will miss this amazing little bar and awesome atmosphere. Thanks so much for making us feel so welcome. People please go here for a pint or a some fish and chips try the wings or ask for the famous Ginn and tonic. You won't be disappointed I promise.,1
504,"Came by after searching for brunch in the Ktown area. I enjoyed the Black Bean Korean noodle, it was decently portioned and one of the best I've had in a while. The vibe here is very homely, which is quite fitting for a Korean restaurant in Korean town. The washroom weirdly structured. The female toilet and sink for the female washroom was to close together, and the ceiling for the male washroom was very low. Just a note that this restaurant doesn't take Credit. Service was slow and the waiter took a while to notice us, even though the restaurant was almost empty.",0
505,"Ok well first of all we made a reservation for 20 and we were there on time (the manager tried to pin this one on me) and guess what .. They didn't have any tables set up for us. I MEAN COME'ON . Why did I even take the time to make a reservation 2 weeks in advance. This business is crap seriously do not go there. Go somewhere else. You pay for the food and the service just remember that.
I never complain about anything in life, but I must admit I was really upset about this because the manager was trying to blame me for I don't know what reason.. I guess for making a reservation at their restaurant. 
Never again",0
506,"Okay, so here we are in Incheon and we want a cold beverage and something to eat. We've been here quite a few times and haven't been too lucky. We check out Trip Advisor and guess who's #1, Cinder Bar! We're reading the reviews and Warren, the owner's name keeps popping up. We head out to find The Cinder Bar.
We walk in and are instantly greeted by, guess who? Warren! He is one passionate and friendly man. He wants us to enjoy ourselves. The music was so great. We were hungry and he recommended a few items and they were delicious.
Warren is known for his famous gin and tonic, I'm not a fan of gin. He insisted we try just one, which we shared. I slurped it down and now I like gin and tonics.
We ordered his homemade dip and chips, chicken wings and fish and chips. All very, very good.
Warren, we're spreading the word, we had so much fun!",1
507,"First off they don't have sushi but it is still on the menu and sign. Second people were walking out before even ordering because the service was so slow with not very many people in here. It took 4 adults over 2 hours to get 3 servings for AYE! Food was good once we got it but seriously that long to get food that we had to cook ourselves. Oh and almost 2 hours for lettuce. Definitely not coming back. Oh and make sure to check your check before you leave, we had a $20 gratuity added automatically!",0
508,Food was just ok but the unpleasant staff lacks motivation. Waiter messed up the table ans just IGNORED.,0
509,"Unfortunately Not as good as we expected with the high stars that it got.We are not Korean so we may have different taste. We ordered Oxtail soup and beef brisket soup,but taste was so bland. It's just hot water, nothing taste of Beef broth. What is this?!?! So added in lots of Korean miso and some other sauce, but we still couldn't eat. However Kimchi was so delicious. Waitress was nice and friendly. The price is higher than some other Korean restaurant in LV. Unfortunately we are not going back there again.",0
510,"Like some other comments, I experienced a Korean BBQ whilst in Tokyo many many years ago, and have wanted to experience it again but have been unable to find one in Scotland. I then found the Korean BBQ on the tripadvisor website and immediately visited.
I ordered a mixed meat set meal. The waiter suggested that this was a 3 person serving but since there were 2 of us, they would pack the remainder for take-away.

The mixed meat plater is accompanied by an array of side dishes from salad leaves to chilli paste. The platter itself held many differently marinaded cuts of meat (chicken pork and beef) All raw for you to cook yourself on the bbq grill situated in the centre of the table.

The meats were delicious and as we did not finish, the waiter packed up the remaining uneaten cook meats. We accompanies the meal with korean beer which was the perfect match.

For the uninitiated, this as a really fun way to dine, and something everone should try. It can get busy at the usual eating times so booking is advised. We ate after the lunchtime rush so was easy to get a table. I've already made a reservation for next Saturday and looking forward to it.
One last interesting point, the bbq meal consists of meats and veg so a carb free option, making it both delicious and healthy. A seafood option is available also.

Check it out, you will love it.",1
511,Great little restaurant. Cook your own bbq meat which would be fun for a group. Lots of other dishes available. Fresh and tasty. Ask if you don’t want it too spicy or ask for extra if you like it a little hotter. Free sides dishes. Good Korean tea snd the seafood pancake delicious. Cash only. Will make a return visit. Opening offer 10% off the bill. Gunbae.,1
512,"The food is good but the service is TERRIBLE. It is slow and the server completely ignored our table to take our papers with our orders. The restaurant wasn't even full. Moreover, they are like throwing the plates on the table without even mentioning the fact them bringing wrong orders. Never gonna go back there. There are other better korean bbq  than this place like kalbi, yoko or sota bbq",0
513,"Decent food (especially since there are no other dak galbi places in Toronto) but service is TERRIBLE and portions are tiny!!!

I've been here with just one other person, and another time with a large group and both times we weren't served enough food.  Miraculously, a pan of dak galbi with 2 portions is exactly the same size as one with 3 portions (with the same kind of meat and exact same add-ons).  Why???  WHY would I pay 50% more to get the same amount of food?!  Note that 2 portions is *barely* enough food for 2 adults.

The kicker is that because we discovered when the food arrived that it wasn't enough, we asked for the menu so that we could order more food and we were told that we weren't allowed to!  What restaurant only allows people to order just once?  Especially when their portions are miniscule!  And WHY didn't they tell us so at the beginning or state it somehwere on their menu?!

I make my own dak galbi at home now.  It's easy to make, it tastes way better, the portions are appropriate, it's cheaper, and I can put whatever in it I want.  I don't understand why veggies cost extra for dak galbi at Joons.  That's totally unreasonable to me too.  I wouldn't go back.",0
514,"The beer is reasonably priced including a few New Zeeland made beers you can't get anywhere else in Songdo. If you are feeling hungry they offer a couple options including some killer wings that come with a their own unique 'Cinder Sauce'. The real highlight of Cinder Bar is the service, the owner Warren is there every night and he is by far the best bartender in Incheon, he is warm friendly, and never let's an empty glass sit. Despite being born in New Zeeland he has lived in Korea long enough to speak fluent Korean. Because of this the atmosphere is unique it's not just a 'foreigner bar', every member of the Cinder crew can speak English and Korean so both locals and foreigner mingle in roughly equal proportions.",1
515,"Would totally recommend for couples, friends and families. The service was great, the food was brilliant and prices were fair for the great food provided!",1
516,Food is cooked in front of you at your table in a big pot. Served with condiments. Nice experience and atmosphere.,1
517,"Food was decent. The quantity was way less though. We ordered the Pork and Kimchi Fried Rice ($9.95), Mandu -5 ($8.95), kimchi pancake ($7.95). We took the food to go and while checking out there seemed to be a mandatory tipping option. This brought our total to $35. This, for a meal for 2 people, for the quantity of food provided, I thought was very expensive for a takeout restaurant. I would not visit again. I don't understand all the good reviews out here.",0
518,"I came down to Birmingham for the day (from London) for business reasons and was craving some Korean food after a hard days work, but had no idea on where I could get some. So then I contacted a few friends who resided in the city and asked for recommendations, which then later they brought me to ""Miss Korea"".

When we first stepped into the restaurant we weren't greeted, my first impression of the interior was that it was immaculate and bold. However, it was quite smokey inside as there was an open kitchen but also meat being grilled on some customers table tops, but that was understandable. After being noticed a few minutes later we were then seated and decided to order:
3 portions of bulgogi
1 portion of la Galbi
1 portion of lettuce
2 portions of kimchi cabbage
1 portion of seasoned spinach
1 portion of dukbokki
1 portion of rice
1 portion o fkimchi fried rice
and 4 drinks

The food was of good quality but had it's flaws, such as the dukbokki was quite over cooked which resulted in a really mushy texture, the kimchi fried rice was quite on the dry side and also the portions were quite small compared to the price. But that wasn't the problem, the real problem was the staff and service. Firstly, the female staff who was serving us was sulking for some reason and seemed like she didn't want to serve us. Her attitude towards us, was like she didn't care about anything and just wanted to go home. After our order was taken, we had to wait rather long for our food to arrive and then when it finally arrived some dishes were missing. For example the meats arrived but the lettuce and rice were nowhere to be found and it seemed that the waitress had forgotten about them. Which then I reminded her and she said, I quote ""okay"" and left. No apology whatsoever. When we nearly finished the meat, she then brings out the rice and lettuce and still no apology. With then we decided to just finish quickly and leave as we didn't felt welcomed.

The food was of good standard but the price was a bit of the high side. The staff and service however was the final killing blow that assured me to never come back to this restaurant and try else where.",0
519,"My wife and I really enjoyed our dinner here. They also have Hibachi-style, table-side cooking, but we ate at a table. The ribs were so good, but I got full very quickly from a big lunch earlier. They made my hotel room smell so delightful every time the fridge door opened and I almost cried when I left the leftovers in the fridge due to a long day ahead on the road.
For someone who enjoys Korean BBQ short ribs and live/travel to Orlando or Central Florida, this is the place to go. The beef bulgogi was amazing, too. Portions were large and the appetizer of dumplings was very tasty, too. We love Korean food, though we admit we typically do not eat everything. This place is the place for someone who wants to try Korean or eats it often, in my opinion. We will be back. I will also bring a cooler and get an extra order of short ribs.",1
520,"The food at the restaurant is not bad however, the service is terrible. The staff is extremely rude and especially since we were young they treated us unfairly. We know tips is a must therefore we were ready to give them their 15% but they added it themselves into our receipt thinking we were not literate enough to do so ourselves.",0
521,"The food is always good, its just the service that sucks. Our waiter checked on us maybe once and then forgot to put in our order through their fast pay on the tablet at the table. Plus there's the $4 charge to go back in line in case you forgot to put something in your bowl. I've been here several times and never had that enforced on me. Just crappy service.",0
522,"The food here was really delicious. I came with a friend who was vegan, and there were a couple of options on the menu for him but most were meat. Not holding that against the restaurant though, the food was all excellent. Have actually been turned away a couple of times because they were too busy. Always a good sign.",1
523,"Good option of bar for everyone in this city; not just foreigners but also koreans; I am a korean.this bar has all the kinds of drinks you can imagine. The drink prices are very good and the food prices are great too! Warren, the owner, speaks English and Korean so he talks to everybody. He is so popular that he could be the future mayor of Incheon.

The music here is always good and the service is always excellent. You have to come here.",1
524,"This place is overpriced. Meat quality is poor. Their meats are not marinated they are only drizzled. Grills were dirty. We ordered a beer and was warm, they brought us another that was also warm. For $22 it's not worth it. For $4 more go to Gen Korean house for better service and food quality. While we were there a family walked out and complained to waiter that the facility was dirty. Also for $2 more go to Korean house BBQ in Mesa. Stay away from  Arirang.",0
525,"This is a fabulous place, you can't phone and book but you can go in and reserve a table on the night , very busy , basic style but food great, there was eight of us we had a set menu for four people twice there was more food than we knew what to do with, reasonably priced as well.",1
526,"Just tried to go here for dinner. We were seated quickly since it wasn't busy, yet after 10 minutes we had to ask one of the waitresses to have our order taken. She said she was going to get our server, didn't even ask if we wanted drinks. Whoever was supposed to serve our table never showed, after another 5 to 10 minutes. Ended up leaving and going elsewhere. There's plenty of other places here in Tempe marketplace.",0
527,Toppoki was full so went here. The smell of cooking hit me as I went in and there was a smokey haze in the place. All the tables were full so we were asked to wait at a table and given menus. The service was ok and the food was nice but there were a lot of people barbecuing and the atmosphere got thicker and thicker. When we left all the windows were steamed up and the smoke haze was quite thick. Don't go here in decent clothes or before going on to an event.,0
528,"Food was pretty good but the price was a little steep. Good customer service, however we did get something that we did not order.",1
529,"An unexpected delight very close to Victoria Station, which is otherwise surrounded by ‘chain’ franchise eateries. Cosy homely atmosphere, very friendly service and the food was yummy!!! My nieces and I ordered a couple of starters and a couple of main dishes, incl. the beef bibimbap, which was recommended to us by someone waiting for her takeaway. There was more than enough to share and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was my first time at a Korean restaurant and I would definitely go again. But please check the state of your bathrooms regularly :-(",0
530,My family and I travelled from Nizwa to Muscat just to dine here last Friday for our dinner. Efforts paid off! The restaurant has comfortable and quiet ambiance. Felt the Kpop vibes. Our orders quickly served on the table. Excellent Korean dishes. We loved every bit of it. Reasonably priced. Friendly and helpful staff. The restaurant is clean. Location is good. We really enjoyed dining here. Our new favorite restaurant if visiting Muscat.,1
531,Warren has created magnificent spot here! The g & t's are legendary and quench the thirst supremely on a hot day in the city! The welcome you receive is fantastic and sets up what always follows.... A great social experience! I personally cannot wait to enjoy this bar more and more! A top place to visit!,1
532,"Heard a lot about this place. One of our visitors said was his favorite restaurants in Phnom Penh--could not wait to try it. It was interesting and unusual from a Western perspective, but definitely not as freaky as others might think. The food was good, not the best Korean food I have ever had (had North Korean food in Seoul which was better). The pork ribs and bimbimbap at a hot stove pot was pretty good. The dumpling and the vegetable dish were nothing to write home about. The waitresses were definitely quite talented, well-dressed and well-groomed. My friends thought they look angry from time to time--they were a bit stressed since they had to wait on all customers and to perform as well. Don't expect that they will come by to chat with you. The waitresses and the show definitely were trying to reinforce the traditional expectation of women being very thin, submissive and gentle. No wonder most of the patrons there tonight were males. Who knows how much of the show were truly north Korean or modified to feed a particular expectation? The restaurant is closed by 9 pm which I did not expect. Overall not very memorable, food was only alright--would not likely go back as the place did allow smoking which always put a big dent on the overall dining experience.",0
533,Excellent service and food. Owners are very friendly and warm. Love their Galbee (beef ribs) and Japchee (sweet potato noodles). My 4 year old loves their chicken/beef udon! I always go there with my family for dinner and coworkers for business lunch. Very good place for any occasion (family/business).,1
534,"The bibimbap is okay, but I found the flavours boring and out of harmony with one another. Also, the eggs are not freshly fried. I understand why they do this, but the pre-fried egg was rubbery and lukewarm. 

The sushi was also okay. I purchased a tray of salmon sashimi and california rolls. The sashimi was acceptable, but not the best grab-and-go I've had. The california rolls were atrocious. The avocado was rock hard and stringy with brown spots. Completely inedible.",0
535,"What a find the Cinder Bar is! Amid the high rise buildings stuffed with expensive restaurants, massage places, doctor's offices and just about everything else in this city there is a much better option. The Cinder Bar is located on the ground level at the last building on the left side of the road just before the bridge as you leave Incheon for the airport. Warren and his new partner Sam have crafted this cozy establishment into a welcoming, warm and friendly place to have a nice meal and a brew or two. If you are in the mood, they also have a superior selection of single malt whiskeys. The prices are the best you will find in Incheon and the atmosphere is unmatched. The food is excellent as well. This is a family affair and Warren's wife is the establishment's cook. Of particular note is the new hamburger offered which is a new collaboration between Warren and ""The Flying Chef"". It's easily the best burger in town. Should you decide to give the Cinder Bar a try I can guarantee you will have a new favorite hangout on your list.",1
536,"I decided to come by here at random, the restaurant is eye catching so I walked in. I did have quite the appetite and it was filling as it is all you can eat. 

However, the service is very slow, be prepared to wave your hand to catch the waiters attention. The food was average, the meats were barely marinated, sushi was decent. The fried tempuras were good, can't really mess that up. The service is what is hurting the restaurant. If you're reading this, please step it up to increase and keep your business.

This place is quantity over quality, which I do prefer at times but this place isn't worth trying.",0
537,"I came here twice so far and love the food, Miss Korea is a real authentic Korean restaurant with BBQ plates on the table and a huge menu of everything from kimchi pancakes, bibimbap and a variety of jigae to BBQ meat and seafood, grilled and fried dishes plus a full vegetarian menu. The quality of food here is excellent and they’re kimchi is the best I’ve ever had in terms of UK Korean restaurants, the portions are big and the prices are cheap; mains are around £8-9, starters are around £5 each. The service is basic at best, the staff are efficient but not too attentive. They also do not accept card so it’s cash only, which is a downside. I loved the seafood bibimbap and spicy tofu jigae, both tasted divine. Overall high quality flavorful and authentic Korean food, cheap prices, generous portions but average service.",1
538,Best bar in Songdo with tons of internationals! Everyone who is visiting this area should consider coming by this welconing bar.,1
539,"Really bad service, waited for a long time without having a waiter. And there was not many guests in the restaurant. Never gonna go back again.",0
540,"Been there twice since they've opened and, yes, the food is good (I'd give it 4 stars - points off because my kimchi soup was a bit bland..), but it was so frustrating how the dished appeared with LONG delays for different people...
The first time, it was just two of us, and it was relatively busy, so we thought it's not the end of the world that my boy-friend had already finished his meal before mine appeared (also: he hadn't noticed that he had to order rice with his meal and this also wasn't pointed out by the waiter... by the time we noticed this, the waiter was nowhere to be seen, so basically, my bf ate his main course..with some delay also his rice portion.. and then , finally did my course appear).

The same thing happened again the next time we came. We were 4 people then and there was only one other couple in the restaurant, but there was a ~10min lag between everyone's course being brought to the table. Very frustrating! (The fact that the waiter said ""enjoy your meal"" to the first person who got his food and then walked away, kind of implied that he'd better eat before it gets cold, I guess...)

It was generally very hard to get the waiter's attention , he even disappeared to the outside and never looked if we wanted more food/drinks etc.
By the end of the meal, we were sat for 30minutes chatting, but nobody came to actually remove the dirty plates and dishes from us.

I really hope that this place gets its service sorted, because it could be really good if it does...",1
541,"I've eaten here for 15 years. Today it was as good as ever. The Galbee and Kimchi are excellent. I've never been disappointed. If you like or want to try Korean food, this is the BEST place in the Orlando area. The staff are wonderful.",1
542,"Amazing service. The waiters were absolutely lovely. It looked great and the dishes were really tasty. The Kimchi pancake was the best I have ever tried. We also enjoyed the tteokbokki and the bulgoki. The bibimbap was slightly disappointing, but the overall experience was brilliant. Also, nice music.",1
543,"Today I ordered Genghis Grill through Foodsby for lunch. I was super excited for my food since I don't get to Genghis Grill often.

I opened my food and immediately noticed lots of burnt pieces of food. Totally fine because who doesn't like a little bit of char right? Well as I mixed my food around, it was clear that my food was left on the grill too long! I was really disappointed that the taste of burnt food overpowered all their awesome sauces.

Think twice about ordering them for lunch. :/",0
544,"I lived in Asia, and pretty familiar with Korean quisine. This is very mediocre, non-authentic Asian food restaurant with pricey dishes! 
I ordered shrimp japchae, and a small portion costed me $14! They don't give you any additional sides with it like all other authentic Korean places do. 
To be fair, the dish was pretty tasty, so giving them 2 stars.

Place is small, not cozy and nice, I wouldn't want to sit there and eat, take-out is the best way to go if you really want to try this place out",0
545,Excellent Food Eel hot pot is Delicious Good service good food i will come again thank you very much,1
546,"I think this is the first time I paid over $40 for Chinese takeout. Quite a shock- serves me right for ordering food post hangover without a glance at any of the prices!

The fried dumplings were crispy, and the spicy sauce was a change from other takeout places I've tried, which send you home with plain soy sauce to dunk your dumplings in. My friend had teriyaki wings and fries. We spilt the Korean BBQ wings, which were pretty good, but not as mouth watering as the ones we've had at Seoul Food across town.

What I enjoyed the most was the shrimp lo mein. I noticed that it was soaked with sauce, which is what I usually deal with at other places. I never paid it much mind before, but I prefer it this way. I suppose it's just lightly tossed as opposed to saturated with grease, but the flavor did not suffer one bit. I had to leave it for the next day after stuffing myself with wings and dumplings. Certainly worth the slightly higher cost than other takeout places in the area.",0
547,"Decided to forego the AYCE (all you can eat) Mon Ami down the street and try Le K'Bob. From the exterior, it looked promising. Korean fried chicken and bibimbap, what's not to like? The interior has a modern, almost sterile look to it. Not necessarily my flavor, but no complaints. The young man serving us seemed somewhat new at the food service game, but I've been there before so I gave him a pass. We ordered the sweet and spicy fried chicken and the bibimbap. The chicken was solid, had a bit of a cinnamon twang to it, but could've used a little more kick. We used the hot sauce that came with the bibimbap to dip the chicken in, and that made all the difference. Speaking of the bibimbap, it was also pretty solid, maybe could spen more time getting crispy in the clay pot, but otherwise pretty good. Overall i give this place a solid 3 stars, but unfortunately for these folks it'll be hard competing with their neighbors at Mon Ami.",0
548,"Absolutely awful!!  smelled, Kalbi only had end meat for $27??? I actually would give this restaurant no star!! It used to be one of restaurants we always come as soon as we arrive in Vegas, like this evening. But no more!! Need another competition to wake them up!!",0
549,"I first came here back in May, and now I am one of the regulars. I love it! Some of my new best friends I met at the Cinder Bar!

The owners, Warren and Hanna, are always lovely and are introducing new Cinderites to us all the time.

The drink selection is fantastic. I personally enjoy the Monteith's selection from New Zealand; especially the Radler!!
Food-wise, the wings are my favorite, but it's the Cinder sauce that make them absolutely divine!!

The Cinder Bar is the new mover and shaker in the city of Songdo.
Check it out.... NOW!",1
550,"Before leaving NZ to live in Songdo, South Korea, I checked out the important things to me squash, golf and a good bar. Squash is virtually non existent, golf is too expensive, but the Cinder Bar , oh the Cinder Bar. From the first moment I entered the doors of this small bar, I realised it had a huge heart. The guy who runs it tirelessly is Warren, a guy who remembers everyone’s names. The beer selection is amazing ... 12 on tap and at least 12 different bottled ales. The food is simple , but wholesome and tasty. Do not visit Songdo, without checking the Cinder Bar out.",1
551,"I thought we'd give this place a try having been to two other Korean bbq restaurants in the area of town, looks okay from the outside and it wasn't busy plus the menu looked nice in the window.
We were quickly seated and set about choosing our food - there is a good bbq selection but I fancied something different so we chose a couple of starters, a side, two mains and an extra. This didn't take too long but then the waiting began.
There were two other couples and a table of around ten guys who were doing their own bbq and didn't need much assistance. The kitchen seemed well staffed, two girls serving but one was also doing the bar and the manageress was easily spotted in the kitchen too.
More waiting.........
I haven't even been asked what I want to drink yet.
More waiting.........
Im getting impatient and annoyed now but I am still being ignored by the serving staff.
Okay now I'm angry and I decided in one minute I am going to get up and walk out.
45 seconds in I get served!. We order everything and it doesn't take too long to come - it all comes at different times and overall the food was very nice, couldn't fault it.
but then the waiting starts again........
Ive finished my drink and want another, I even position the empty glass to the side of the table near the servers but it doesn't happen.
I wouldn't mind some dessert too but im still sat around waiting and getting impatient again and eventually I announce '*$%% it' and get up, pay and leave.
Luckily you pay at the counter and don't ask the waitress for a bill otherwise I would of been there much longer.

They missed out on me having another couple of beers and trying the Korean rice wine plus a couple of desserts. I wont go back again - I did think about venting my anger at the manageress but she just looks at you from the kitchen and doesn't give any direction to waiting staff.
If it was busy then god help anyone wanting to get served.
I had to go somewhere else for pudding and a few beers and I wont go there again. There are much better Korean restaurants in the quarter so I would give Miss Korea a big miss.",1
552,"Came in with a group of 8. Initially we were looking at this sketchy looking place across the street with minimal decor (literally, one empty room with a couple tables and chairs set up), but we couldn't find it on yelp so we ended up looking at mama chef.

After being greeted at the door, we were brought into a room in the back, which I presume is their storage area since there were bags upon bags of rice, pancake mix, and other ingredients. It was an interesting decision since there were tables of 4 next to each other that they could have sat us at, but they decided to go with the VIP experience.

Washrooms are in the basement, and not very accessible. They were pretty standard for a washroom in koreatown. Don't expect much there.

We were offered some side dishes, along with two whole pancakes! Which is pretty crazy, cause some other places usually give you a few pieces, and some places don't even provide any. And they were full-sized pancakes, so this is a good start. The pancakes were pretty good too.

There weren't many utensils in the box, so we had to ask for more, but it was quickly provided.

The menu features a variety of options such as fried cutlets of meat, dumplings, bibimbap, pork bone stew, fried rice in stone bowls, hot plates, and table BBQ.

I ordered the fried rice with chicken in a stone bowl. It comes with the sweet/spicy korean sauce, so if you can't handle spice you might want to avoid this one. I enjoyed the flavour, though I would have preferred more spicy and less sweet. Price a bit on the higher end, but I guess that's where the pancakes come in.",0
553,"Order included Bulgogi, dol-sot Bibimbap & gyoza & Hite brews. Kimchi was some of the best we've ever had. Fairly priced & good atmosphere.",1
554,"To over eat or not to over eat...?  For someone with no eating discipline, it really is a serious question!  With a set bento dinner being almost the same price as the AYCE, it can be a tough call at Korean Grill House.  For lunch, a bento is a no brainer - slightly cheaper prices with their lunch menu and I can still get through the rest of the day without groaning about how full I am.  One thing that I did find is that the cuts of meat in the lunch bentos tend to be very poor - fatty, tough, and over-salted.  At lease with AYCE grilling, the fat will render itself.",0
555,Ate here with my 10 yr old. He doesn't like spicy food. Waitress recommended chicken bulgogi with rice and cheese. Ohhh it was really really good. They have free veggie salad and barley tea. Price is very affordable. Highly recommended for families.,1
556,"Must visit place if you are feeling lost in an alien land
Warren the owner is an excellent host
He and his wife manage this place and you always feel at home with them
I gave him a surprise by calling him by his name in first visit ( came to know thro the reviews ) but believe me he will remember your name even if you visit after a year
The beer is good so is the food nicely selected by warren and prepared by his wife",1
557,"First of all, the place is nice, you can walk around the house for some picture taking of traditional house designs, though the area is not that big. Staffs are accommodating, friendly, and totally no issues for English communication. As I traveled with my pregnant wife, I do not have issues on asking them for those prohibited foods for her like raw meat and those with caffeine. Regarding the food, the food is great and a bit different compared to the typical menu on restaurant, thus not sure if those are actually traditional. What I remember is that the servings are small but it is a lot, and they serve it so fast that we haven't finished yet with the first one but they are already serving the 3rd dish. But i think they are doing it so you will able to finish your meal before the show starts. About the show, same with the other reviews, recommendable and very traditional. I'm about to give a perfect rating for this review because of the show, but I feel that the price is very expensive that I expect more, maybe on the food, and no extra charges on the drinks.",0
558,"Cozy bar with a very good selection of craft beers, both on tap and in the bottle. The owner, Warren, is very friendly and makes you feel welcome the moment you step in the door. It is easy to find and is popular with the locals and the expat crowd. Opens late and stays open late.",1
559,The Cinder Bar is a quaint little place good for food and drinks. It's small so it can get crowded quite quickly; but everyone is friendly and if you're lucky Warren might mix you up something special that isn't found on the menu.,1
560,"The food is great...when you actually receive it. We came there for lunch and asked to be seated outside. Mind you, there was no one outside and maybe three tables inside. We ordered our food quickly. I ordered the salmon avocado ball and my friend the japchae noodle bowl. It took the waitress 15 minutes to bring our waters and an additional 20 minutes to bring ONE entree out..yes ONE!! Then 10 minutes later the other entree comes out. No apology nothing....so I am giving them 3 stars to be nice because the food was good. But don't come there if you're hungry because it will be an hour before you get your food",0
561,Not a fan of wings the size of my arms! Who put steroids in my food!!! Service was not impressive and the food was mediocre.,0
562,"I ordered Sesame Chicken- carryout
postive:
- tasty fried rice- smoked flavor
- egg rolls- very good

negative:
sesame chicken tasted bad, the chicken had an awful smell and taste to it. I had to throw it out. 

Don't think I will be going back.",0
563,We were offered to taste samples of Great Collection of beer. Hence we could try and select the best. Best quality beer and food though very limited on the menu. He ensures the best. Nice ambience and warren Kidd is explosion of energy. He also offered to pick and drop at our hotel. He knows what he does and how to do it. The team is also as good as the owner. Great fun.,1
564,"Amazingly good Korean BBQ! The staff was incredibly friendly and the food itself was just absolutely amazing. My friend and I shared a BBQ set (B) and the kimchi pancakes. It was soooo good. Will definitely visit again next time in Edinburgh.
I would consider booking in advance!",1
565,Brought my sister here for her first Korean BBQ experience and I'm really happy I did! They offer different BBQ sets which are really good value for money and they have Chamisul soju which is my personal favourite. Staff are friendly and offer to show you how to use the grill on the table. Good quality meat. Only issue I had were there were only 3 side dishes and kimchi was extra. Overall a good experience!,1
566,"First, I certainly don't proclaim to be an expert on Korean food. My limited experience has been eating a friend's (from South Korea) home cooked food which was excellent. This food was decent but not as good as I've had. I thought the food was somewhat bland until I added a good amount of hot sauce. Very good waiter that was helpful in navigating the menu. Total bill for two meals $26.17 without the tip.",0
567,"The selection isn't the best I've had in terms of Korean BBQ, however, what you do get tastes quite good! I ordered plenty of shrimp, fish, beef and chicken. The vegetables I ordered weren't the freshest so they came out quite dry, apart from that, the menu doesn't deliver numerous options like other (better) Korean BBQ places do (especially my favorite one on Monkland). Nonetheless, if you're in the downtown area and in the mood for a 30$ all you can eat Korean BBQ, give it a taste! Maybe you'll like it, maybe it'll be average.",0
568,"And were never disappointed. You can never go wrong with the set menu (although quite tricky). Minimum order of 2, and everything to share. We are 3, and were just enough for small eaters like us. Will definitely return. 😊",1
569,"Chicken galbi with mozzarella cheese is great. Staff can't speak much English and that maybe a factor people think they are rude. But they're not. They try their best. Good food but really spicy. It's around $12 per person, which is well worth it.",1
570,"If you want to try something different and you are daring, go to E-Jo's.   It is very Korean.   The cooked beef soup was great, but we did order the mixed meat soup which included parts of beef I did not care for (tripe, etc. etc. etc.)   So if you are not that adventurous, just get the beef.   Also, the other Korean dishes are great.   If you go, helpful to have a Korean with you or you can ask the waiter/waitress more info.   WARNING: traditional Korean.   So do not expect the grills.",0
571,"I'd give this place 2.5-3.5 stars. The food is okay, honestly, we have just 3 or 4 spots in Montreal for people craving for BBQ..
It's better than Sota tho.
I don't really appreciate the service here. First, they assumed that we were Chinese and they spoke Chinese with us... Ofc we couldn't understand what they told us.
After, we ordered some side dishes and specially we ordered Takoyaki 3 times but they brought us these dishes after we finished our dinner :) It's ridiculous lol
The waiter who served us in the last minute was rude when we reordered the Takoyaki. We ended up having 2 small pieces although we ordered 3 times so it supposed to be 6 pieces. 
I went to Seoul Chako 2, 3 times and I think there is no special difference between Lunch and Dinner, just the price looooool.
Anyway, we chose Seoul Chako cuz we had no choice and at that time we were craving for BBQ and meattttt.

I think I'll try Gyu Kaku next time.",0
572,"I had bogogi bibimbap and beer. Have to say I'm quite disappointed. According to the reviews I was expecting authentic Korean food, however, my bibimbap has lots of arugula and lettuce. This is salad with minced beef on top of the rice, not authentic. Not even spicy.",0
573,"We had to give this a 2, because, as others have posted, the service was pretty slow and something less than friendly. We were there on a Saturday, so it wasn't super busy. The food was fine, so if you want Korean and aren't fussy on the service, it could work for you. The larger question we discussed was should ethnic restaurants honour their culture when it comes to customer service or should they reach to be more consistent with their customer base? Also, we were left wondering if Koreana BBQ's preferred customer base was indeed Koreans as opposed to a wider and more diverse customer base. Just food for thought.",0
574,"This was my first visit for quite a while and since it has been refurbished. Mid evening on a Friday night we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The new grills seemed easy to use and the waitress fired it up as soon as we ordered. We piled in with beef, prawns, omelette, seafood tempura and kimchi. It was great watching our prawns and beef griddle while we supped on beer and Korean tea (which has overtones of vanilla). We got lettuce with the beef (which made it great to make beef, barbecue sauce and kimchi parcels). The omelette/pancake was every bit as good as I had hoped after seeing Judy Joo make one on a TV programme. The prawn, fish and vegetable tempura were delicious, crispy with firm flesh and even better when dipped in soy sauce. The kimchi.was really fiery. There was far too much to eat but they kindly boxed the leftovers for us. The waitresses are friendly and efficient. It surprises me that so few brummies visit this place: most of the clientele were oriental. The food is delicious and £56 was not too bad considering how much we ordered. With parking just across the road I don't know why you haven't visited. Highly recommended.",1
575,"Metal scrubber in the food... what... seriously!!!
We have been dining here since Takamatsu & like to support it. 
However, I am very disappointed in the quality of service & food. 
I must say the taste has improved but lots of MSG & I actually found a piece of metal scrubber in my food. So disappointed!

The owner's daughter should not be in customer service. She has no idea about the new menu, can't explain about the dishes, doesn't even know what it is when asked, very angry everytime we've gone there, looks at you from head to toe as if you are nobody. Then, when calling in to make take out order, she laughs & giggles while you are on the phone trying to place an order. Very Rude!!!
I've never experienced such a rude behavior & unprofessional in my whole 47years of my life.
Plus, it shouldn't be called sushi bar when there's no sushi bar or a sushi chef.
NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!!!",0
576,"Used to go here a lot but then found Toppoki, which we like. Toppoki was rammed last night so decided to venture further down the road again and I'm glad we did! MK has been refurbished and is very smart. The waiting staff certainly aren't Korean but the service was warm and friendly. The food was top notch - we really enjoyed the BBQ and bibimbap was super tasty. Only criticism would be lack of extraction in the restaurant. The new BBQs don't give off much smoke (now electric and not coal as before) but when they do smoke, the only answer is for them to open the door!",1
577,"I can't really say enough about this establishment. The atmosphere and the staff's enthusiasm makes this a ""must see"" while in Songdo. The food is great, the beer selection is spot on, and the conversation is second to none. I frequent this pub every time I travel to Korea. So, get off your duff and mosey on down to the Cinder Bar. Oh, and ask for the killer Cinder (gin) and Tonic.",1
578,"overall it's my first time having korean barbecue and i sure will go back again ! 
but the only thing i didn't like is that the staff didn't tell us anything at all. like about the fact that we have to write our order on a piece of paper, or how to cook the meat correctly. they also didn't check if we needed something. i had to wait 10 min to ask a waiter for a fork and he took too much time to bring one. i understand that it was busy but the staff need to be more welcoming and more helpfull.
PS: i also made a mistake i didn't check before and went at 2:30 so we had 30 min left to order everything we want because lunch time finishes at 3.",0
579,Never coming back to this place because we waited for 1 hour for food only to tell us that our order was never in! Lol. This place is such a joke and always will be. Horrible service. We will be telling our friends and family not to come here!,0
580,From the moment you walk through the door you are among friends. The owner is the most hospitable I have ever met and the cocktails are very well done. Limited food menu but also tasty. Go for the wings. Thank you Waren for a memorable experience. Will be sure to return next time we are anywhere near Incheon. Cheers!,1
581,"We're fond of Japanese and Korean dishes, and ever since the first Korean restaurant that we discovered near Ghala closed, we missed eating authentic Korean food in Muscat. That's why when friends told us that there's another Korean restaurant in the capital, we searched for it and tried their signature dishes. We were not disappointed.
The chicken was fantastic (there are 2 variants, one glazed with honey-barbecue sauce, the other just plain fried). It is basically similar to the dish from our favorite restaurant when we visited Seoul. Their japchae was also superb, and the kimbap as well. Their bulgogi was not exactly what I expected, but it was also generally good.They even serve few Japanese dishes, such as the miso soup which we ordered, which, I would say, was also tasty. The only thing I was disappointed a bit was that the side dishes (ban chan) was fewer compared to the previous Korean restaurant that we used to visit.
This restaurant is a little bit small; there are only about 5 tables, if I remember correctly. There is ample parking space at the side of the building where the restaurant is located. In terms of location, the restaurant is not hard to find, as it is just on the opposite road of Chocolate Room, another popular establishment in Ghubra.
The price is a little bit on the expensive side, but that's how it is anyway in majority of restaurants in Muscat.",1
582,"Good service, good food, simple menu. I ordered what is best described as a sizzling bowl of rice, pork and vegetables. Squeeze in a load of chilli sauce and mix it all together. Tasted great
My only criticism is that, whilst the atmosphere was vibrant, it's one of those places when you're sat almost touching the person on the next table. Very noisy, busy and hot!",0
583,"Had an overnight layover in Incheon and was looking for a spot to get out of the airport as we had a room at the transit hotel. After getting a stamp on our boarding card from the airline (needed!), we were allowed to leave the airport. Warren, the owner, gave our Uber driver directions on how to get to the bar (20 min from the airport). Kitchen open late for fish/chips and wings. Great alcohol selection (IPA imported from the U.S. on tap!) Great spot and will come back next time we have an overnight layover on Delta or Korean Air. Great mix of locals and expats. A must see on the the way through.",1
584,"This place is very authentic Korean. Bibim Bob is so incredibly good. Kim chi is tasty. Honey ginger tea is awesome. There is a dish with cellophane noodles, veggies and beef that is great. This place switched owners not too long ago, so some of these bad reviews are from before the new owners took over. I highly recommend checking this place out!",1
585,"Really cute cosy wee place and really cool with your own individual BBQs on each table, very different and defiantly worth the experience!!",1
586,"I've been here twice for lunch and ordered the bibimap both times which is a dish of rice, egg and vegetables and I believe meat if I'm not mistaken. It comes out sizzling sort of like fajitas and continues to cook in the clay pot which is a neat experience. It's also served with six different kinds of kimchi - which if you're not familiar with is a wonderful probiotic (gut health promoting) food and they were all fantastic. If you're familiar with latin food, you know that people get to fighting for the crispy rice in the bottom of the pot which is another highlight for me about the bibimap in the clay pot. My husband ordered the korean barbecue lunch and he really enjoyed it. The menu is full of dishes that seem similar to Chinese and Japanese stir fries as well as other seemingly uniquely Korean dishes. They also have tables where you can cook yourself in the center of the table.",1
587,"Initially, we had some trouble finding the place. It's tucked around in back of the building, not in the front. We called and Warren's wife came around the block to meet us and lead the way! How's that for service???

Warren came over and welcomed us immediately upon arrival, making us feel right at home. He asked us about our normal drink preferences, then made some suggestions and headed off to get them.

We tried several different beers and of course, had some pub grub. The burgers and shrimp scampi are great!! Good portions and lots of options to wash it all down.

We met serval of the locals/regulars, who are all super friendly and fun to hang with.

All in all, a great time with great food!! Also, wonderful owners who truly enjoy taking care of their customers and doing everything they can to make your experience a great one!!",1
588,"Great expat bar. The owner, Warren, is a friendly Kiwi who will remember your name from the first time you visit. Good beer selection. Great cocktails. And the kitchen is getting better every month. A very international crowd here.

I love stopping by every time I'm in town.",1
589,"Their chickens are not made to order, and the tables were dirty, crumbs everywhere. Seems like they were not following the original recipe from BBQ Korea which is totally fine if it taste great but unfortunately nahhhhhh.

 The honey garlic wings taste nah-ah Korean sauce, not even close to it. The chickens were not hot, it was just warm temperature because they let out the food that is already cooked whatever hours before.

 I agree when  KFC does this cause it is fast-food store with cheaper price. However BBQ costs way more than KFC but still providing chickens already cooked? I never saw any other BBQs in United State do that. All other retail BBQs are made to order, tastes the same (I went the other BBQs in VA, NY). I will never go to this place ever unless they change their policy. Go star karaoke if you want korean style chicken or KFC for salty huge fried chicken.",0
590,"After being in Korea for about 2 weeks on business I was getting a little tired of endless Korean food. Had a night by myself and found this place down the sheet from my hotel. The owner greeted me at the door and found me a seat at the bar. Had a great conversation with the bar tender, owner and a few of the other patrons. The food was excellent and the beer selection very different than the surrounding bars. Highly suggest asking the owner for his recommendations.",1
591,"Ordered a small half and half wing, the pork buns, and the bibimbap. I really wanted to like the wings because that's what they're known for, but there was very little meat, too much breading, and not enough sauce. I would definitely order the other 2 items again though.",0
592,"Having been to many korean restaurants in the UK (mainly London), I can say without a doubt that this one is the best for food, service is good and the setting is nice. Value wise they give generous portions. Definitley worth a visit if you're in Birmingham. It is situated just on the outskirts of chinatown.",1
593,Really fun authentic bar near the Songdo business district. Friendly staff and good collection of beers and spirits. Frequent it often and it's always fun!,1
594,"This restaurant is at the main road of Monivong Bld. We were sceptical after reading the reviews n possible motives behind it, however we decided to try it since we will never visit Pyongyang. Yes,all the waitresses are dressed in yellow n red chiffon hanbok,same shoes,same scrunchy n similar hairstyle etc. They are soft-spoken, pretty n friendly with the Korean guests. The food is rather similar to South Korean's,or it's just those dishes that we ordered. The kimchi with pork ($8) was good, not sour or too oily. The dog soup ($12) is probably an acquired taste, with lots of spice n some chilli. The boiled mackerel fish ($10) is yummy for fish lovers. Jinro Soju is a tad too expensive for our liking, at $6. The performance starts at 8pm, with the waitresses singing, dancing n playing guitar, drum, keyboard n gu zheng! Very impressive! Definitely worth a visit for the curious, but pls bear with those ppl smoking in the air-conditioned restaurant.",1
595,"There are 2 outlets within Myeongdong. Limited side dishes.. basically only pickled radish and kimchi. We ordered a set for 2 pax with cheese. Serving is big enough for 3 pax though. Like any typical Korean restaurants, cold water is served to every table.",1
596,"Ordered the 5 piece chicken strips with honey mustard sauce. My complaint is that the order took an oddly long time and the sauce was cold (as if they just took it straight from the fridge and didn't bother warming it). But the chicken was soft, fresh, and VERY hot (needed to wait a little bit longer for it to be edible, even the fridge cold sauce couldn't cool it off fast enough). A lot of wait necessary. I also don't recommend the food for people with acid reflux (like me), but if you want an off day this is far from bad.",0
597,"Westernized Korean Food. NO SIDE DISHES. MORE EXPENSIVE. 

I was completely surprised when this Korean restaurant did not serve side dishes. I even confirmed with the waiter who gave me a snarky reply...who disgustedly said no. OK, BAD SERVICE, let's go.

I expected even less after such a poor attitude. We ordered the the soon tofu soup and the dolsot bibimbap. FOOD WAS OK and had larger portions. They definitely toned down the spice level for us. The food didn't have the kick you would find on yonge street. 

The rice in the bibimbap really needs more salt or or a spicier sauce...there were dull parts of it. I know you'd say we should mix the food a bit more, but even the components weren't as on point as they should be. Nothing really stood out.

Next was the soon tofu soup. They chopped up the tofu and it felt like they reduced the amount that was put in normally. They did however add seafood and lots of shrimp, which I thought was nice considering it's higher price point.

To be fair the food was ok. A bit expensive and not traditional but it wasn't bad. And NO I won't be returning. Drive a few streets east and have yourself a real Korean meal. 

This should be a 3 star review, but poor service and attitude does make a difference!",0
598,"We had brunch in this restaurant. We were 7 so we were broken into 2 tables. The waiter informed us that those seated in 1 table were required to have the same order. So, 4 of us wanted spicy food so they sat together and had to order 4 servings of the Spicy Chicken Rice. The other 3 who were not into spicy food had to order 3 servings of the Chicken Bulgogi (which was sweet but also slightly spicy) and separate orders of rice. I really enjoyed the Chicken Bulgogi and even the people in the spicy table liked it. The rice was sticky and delicious too. After eating, we had to go to the cashier at the entrance and pay the bill.",1
599,"Stepped into the restaurant and at the same moment the cashier who was 5 meters away shouted to me if I'm only 1 person. I said yes. In a very rude manner he said they do not serve people who come alone. Terrible, rude, unfriendly service. I will never come again.",0
600,"Met up with old friends and decided to visit here based on Tripadvisor reviews. It was very busy and we were sat right next to the front door despite having booked a table in advance. Personally it was bad positioning as it was bitterly cold and every time someone came and went the cold air rushed in and it was not pleasant. Service was good. Food was good but I just feel it is a very tiny restaurant and there are too many tables crammed in and it makes getting comfortable and enjoying your meal not a great experience. I don't like the next table practically sitting in my lap when eating, but of course this is a personal thing and other folk may not mind this. For me it was a little bit like sardines in a tin, but as I say food good as was service. Don't think I would go back for a 2nd visit unless restaurant was quieter.",0
601,"Haven't been here since forever ago (high school) but impressed to see this place still standing and going strong. The decor is a touch outdated and dusty, and the lights are too dim, which to me isn't the best when you're serving raw food and Want your customers to see what they're getting.

The service is pretty decent, but it's never just your one server - it's basically anyone with a black tee you can call out to or flag down that'll get the job done. Beware their water glasses are plastic and small - and they don't typically give you straws. And sometimes the seating can be pretty tight. Not sure I would come back here by choice, but it does well for being in that area.",0
602,"We met here for lunch.  First of all there were no shrimp. Then we made our choices,  between the coming stone and our table,  our meat/ fish choices had disappeared and then we got bowks that were not ours.   The manager told my elderly mom that her name sounded Like that of a man. Very tactful!  Not a good experIence.",0
603,"Mediocre food, portions were smaller than usually, u have to add cheese, ramen and rice cake, don't bother getting the rice add ones

We waited 30mins for our food to come and they wouldn't give us our side dishes until our meal came......",0
604,"Come for the table top set, left happy.

The table top set that we got was just chicken (there are different varieties) and you get to customize what goes in it (we got rice cake and mozzarella cheese).  The food was good, although it wasn't quick since they cook it in front of you (well, not really, there seemed to be a dining table that was dedicated to cooking it in the dining area).

The side dishes here are lacking compared to Nak Won, here you get broccoli, mashed potato, kim chi and radish.  None of which are memorable.

Cost was $27ish after taxes for two people.  I'd come back for the table top set again although the portion is not really that large, so you may want to add some more things.",0
605,Their pork BBQs are tender and delicious. But I really don't like the fact that we have to order extra for lettuces because lettuces are complimentary for Korean BBQ in most restaurants I have visited. Side dishes have to order separately and not free. Kimchi soup came with complimentary rice bowl though. The taste of other foods are quite okay but not as good as the one I went at Manchester. The decoration is nice and the staff is friendly. Only cash is accepted.,0
606,My friends and I visited this restaurant as a wedding anniversary meal. 12 of us in total. It was a walk and welcoming atmosphere. Food and drinks were served very quickly and it was absolutely amazing from start to finish. The service was incredible.,1
607,Came here for lunch with another 4 people. The food is absolutely delicious and authentic Korean. Spicy but shiok!!!,1
608,"Typical N.Korean food, including cold noodles. Great place if you want to see a bit of North Korea. However, the show had a bit too much chinese songs compare to korean ones.",0
609,"The Cinder bar is a must for anyone visiting Songdo.Good food and loads of great beers on tap and by the bottle and a very nice whiskey selection too.Warren the owner and his wife will make anyone feel welcome.Gotta try the cocktails,Warren makes a superb cocktail!!냠냠~",1
610,"Staying nearby before heading to Daejeon I googled ""craft beer"" more in hope than expectation and this came up

Beer is very good quality in the modern style. Didn't eat there as we wanted some authentic Korean food. The owner, Warren, was good enough to walk us down to a hidden-away BBQ restaurant where he stayed to help with the ordering and the left us to it. We'd never have found the place otherwise. Good to see a proprietor understanding that this is a customer service business and going the extra mile to make folk feel welcome",1
611,"Seriously the bartender, waiter, host is the owner! His life is this bar, he has picked us up and dropped us off at our hotels after dinner and drinks! This place is awesome, 2 levels of drinking, eating and privacy! Off the beaten path, can’t hear traffic or noise from outside! Great beer selection, Fish and Chip is actually great! Can’t believe I’m saying that but it’s the best in Incheon.
You feel like your at “Cheers” when you are there! Sam Malone would love it!",1
612,Service a little slow and the table top barbeque wasn't as good as korean village. For cheap eats in Koreatown i still prefer Sunrise across the street.,0
613,"In all honesty, this place isn't good. The quality of the meat is just super poor (not to mention how the marinade of the meat is also extremely salty). I feel like I have to drink two gallons of water after exiting this resto. I understand it's an all-you-can-eat concept, however, the price does not justify poorly made food.

In terms of the service, the waiters get their tasks done. However, it could get slow at times. And they have a tendency to ignore you??? Like???

It's a decent place for a big crowd, however, do not expect much from it.

Also, a small PSA: be prepared to smell like a grill after you exit this place.",0
614,"I came to Seoul without knowing about K-Pop, K-Drama, or even Korean Food, We didn't quite have the motivation to try out restaurants since me and my friend doen't really enjoy Korean food, but this restaurant changed our opinion. The spice doesn't feel tasteless like the other dakgalbi I tasted in my country , we finished the whole wok just the 2 of us.",1
615,"I always come here when I'm craving a good noodle or rice bowl and love the create-your-own style that Genghis Grill offers. You can choose from a wide array of meats, a huge selection of veggies and other mix ins, and several pre made sauces in the self-serve line. I've never had a bad experience here and will continue to return for delicious meals!",0
616,I just called this place to ask about the buffet and the woman said there wasn't one.. I saw the website earlier so either she had no clue where she works or didn't know what the website said but SHE HUNG UP ON ME!! I called back for a manager and she said they don't work tonight!! A manager?? Will not be visiting this place AT ALL!! Thanks lady for losing a potential customer!!,0
617,"i was so disappointed with this korean grill house. i went on a saturday night. originally from looking at the reviews and menu online, me and my friends believed that the night owl special was 11.99, but the waiter persisted to tell us that they changed it & it's now 17.99. Kind of a bummer cause we were going for the low price. we continued to be seated down & started to place our order for drinks. two of my friends ordered soft drinks & i ordered a water. the waiter told us that my two friends can only get canned drinks ($2) because i'm getting a water. unlimited refilled drinks are $2.25 ... i don't want to be forced into buying a soft drink. i don't like soda. i hate the fizz. He then brought me my water & THE CUP WAS DISGUSTING. that was 1 strike for me. going on with our night , we continued to order our meats (17.99 gave us chicken , beef & pork slices & fish fillet). one of my friends are allergic to fish, so we asked that he didn't get it, but once again , the guy proceeded to say that everyone must order the same things at the same table. it's 17.99 with or without fish. i don't understand why he just couldn't bring one serving of it. When we placed our food on the grill, it burnt instantly; our grill was way too hot. With all my anger built up with this place, i just went to the bathroom to try and escape the night for a little. However, when i came across the bathroom, the disgust of it matched the customer service. This was my 2nd strike. Coming back to my seat to try & rush through the rest of our night, we finished our first round of meat & wanted a second round. there was a little button you can press to request a waiter at our table . we pressed this button 100 times & no one showed up at our table. the button is completely useless. we waited like 30 min for a waiter to come and acknowledge we wanted more meat. When he went to get it, he took forever to bring it back out to us. Our appetite was kind of gone at this point. & i was just done for the rest of the night (strike 3). The meat wasn't well marinated; it was completely bland. The rice was hard & cold. The beef broth was gross. The kimchi was alright lol. We went to pay our bills & one of my friends was paying debit. They were charging $1 for using the debit machine & he was pissed that they couldn't mention it to him before. i do understand that some machines charge a fee, but it would be nice that they told us all the terms & conditions before the night started. I would most definitely choose chakos over korean grill house. this was my first & will be my last time ever going here. My bill here was $50 (2 people) vs at Chako's it was $56 (2 people) & at Chakos , we at least got better service , nice drinks , the meats we requested & a nice atmosphere with enough elbow space. i will never come here again.",0

I visit here monthly and love the veggie options.

Kimchi pancakes are delicious, so in the tofu soup hotpot and bimbwa.",1
621,"we decided to try this Korean BBQ place after last night not so good food at the other restaurant... well, I must say, It’s good, juice marinated ribs, nice and tasty spicy beef stew.",1
622,"Worst place ever. Found a metal coil in my bulgolgi, I don't know how the waitress could've missed it as it was on top and hanging out. Did anyone check my food before serving? Had it remade, tasted precooked and headed up, beef was very chewy and not very flavorful. 

But eh, what can you expect from a fast food, Chinese-Korean fusion?",0
623,"MAKE SURE U CHECK YOUR BILL BEFORE U PAY. The only reason I left this review is because it cheated us. Last nite 12 of us went there for dinner, service was ok, but at the end they over charged us for holiday price.

624,"Cinder bar is a great bar to visit when in Songdo. It can be found near the center of the city by the bridge. There is a good selection of beers and other drinks and Warren is always thinking about bringing in new ones.

The owner, Warren, is very friendly and open. There are often quiz nights, music and other events going on.

A great place to meet people as well.

It's worth a visit.",1
625,"Pricey. But good Korean food. Everytime we are around Longwood area- we crave for the food here. Bulgogi, Gimbab, and so on.",1
626,"This place serves one of the best Korean food in uk, but the service is far from good. The owner should really monitor the service from their staff",1
627,Miss Korea is a breath of fresh air in Birmingham. It has great food and brings a uniqueness to the Far Eastern cuisine scene in nearby Chinatown. I have been here before with my husband last year and I would recommend it. The decor is simple- modern and black. The staff are very friendly and the food was delicious.,1
628,"Find yourself hungry in the Victoria station neighbourhood, and it’s easy to get very depressed very quickly. On offer is the worst that British megachains have to offer (Nando’s, etc.)… and little else.
In that context, we were very happy to find Lime Orange. The fact that the restaurant was packed was encouraging, so we decided to dive in.
I really wanted to like the place, but left disappointed. The problem was that everything we had was desperately bland and lacking in taste. We started with the fried sweet and sour fried chicked. The sweet taste of the sauce decidedly overpowering any chicken that may have been there. Then came the seafood pajeon (korean pancake). It was very anticlimatic, and clearly undercooked. When this was pointed out, they took it back and brought another one after a while…which was not much better. We’ve had much tastier in other places (Asadal for example).
Then came the bibimbaps (we had pork and beef), which seemed to be what everyone comes for…
This too was so bland we almost cried. My girlfriend had to shower hers in chili sauce for her tastebuds to feel something…anything….
It was all just sad.
To Lime’s credit, the portions are generous and we did not leave hungry, nor did our evening break the bank.
Did we leave satisfied ? That’s another story….",0
629,"This is our favorite Korean restaurant in Orlando. We probably go here at least once a month. The bulgogi, seafood pancake, Japchae, and galbi are 4 favorites. The food is consistently good.",1
630,"Honestly I never am one to complain, but this place is horrible! $12 for the smallest bowl of food ever. On top of that the set up is unorganized. We watched our food sit there ready for several minutes, while some guys who were behind us in line delivered their food before ours. We will not be returning!",0
631,"Besides all the great awards, this place has a special award in our hearts. The food cannot taste authentic enough until it is served with the proper ambiance. You'll be delighted by the grills built in the table sections for family style or large party. For a smaller party without grills, It also has quaint private tables. The wait staff are always very cheerful and will explain in broken english what you want to order. Lovely people will serve the side dishes that are always fresh and always an incredible variety. A variety of Korean wines are offered that are served in a special sake cup. Reasonable prices and a great menu await you. I encourage you to take the right person with you who will appreciate this culture and not spoil your time with limits.",1

634,"My friend who was visiting from Bangkok wanted to try something different so we decided to dine here after a long day of shopping. Honestly, I am not a fan of Dakgalbi so I probably would have never ate here if it wasn't for my friend. The waiter wasn't friendly (or rude) but we were able to order our food and got what we needed. We went after the lunch rush but there were still a lot of diners and it was busy. Our food came shortly and we chatted while waiting for the chicken to be cooked all the way. I thought the food was just average and wasn't spicy enough but my friend who never had Dakgalbi before loved it. We loved dipping our chicken in cheese and the fried rice they made for us at the end. I'm glad my friend enjoyed her meal but I probably won't visit on my own.",0
635,"After shopping and walking around myeongdong, you must visit this restaurant located in Myeongdong to feed your belly. You can choose chicken, beef or seafood for the main dish and you can also can choose rice or noodle if you wanna. For addition you can choose vegetable, cheese and another topping to mix it together. The boy from this restaurant will help you too cook with the pan located in you table. Their cooking skill will be a good show that you must see it.",1
636,"Usually when I go to one of these Mongolian wok type places, I leave with a box and a half to go. On the other hand, this one was more expensive and I was still hungry by time I left. The bowl was tiny, the sides were limited, and the sauces were pre-made, pasty, 'meh'. In addition to that, the service was terrible. My drink didn't get refilled even once, and my friend's food sat on the line for ten~fifteen minutes before they decided to bring it over to her. And the restaurant was pretty much empty other than our table, and two or three others, so it's not like they were super busy or something. There was a group of waiters standing around the entire time, chatting obnoxiously loud and basically ignoring us, while one other girl did all the work. 

Pro's: Fresh ingredients, large variety of FRESH meats (a lot of these types of places do frozen), decent spice section, high quality ingredients in general, clean/pretty restaurant. 

Con's: Way overpriced. Tiny portion sizes. (The bowl was shockingly small to begin with, when I got it. And then it was obviously designed to have a really thick bottom to make it even shallower, as well as a wide brim - which is cheap on the restaurants part, and kind of tasteless, in my opinion.) Lackluster sauces. Horrible service. Oh, and this is more of a personal preference, but they only had udon noodles and two rice types for what you wanted as your 'side', i.e the thing mixed into your stir-fry. Everything else was atypical stuff like tortilla strips and things of that nature. Not to hate on fusion foods or anything, but if I'm going to get Asian food, I'd like more Asian selections, haha. 

These Mongolian Grill restaurants are always expensive. However, it's because you're paying for the fact that you get to eat a huge amount of food. I mean, it's just stir-fry. It's rice and vegetables for the most part. Yummy? Yes. High cuisine? Not so much. Worth sit-down prices? In this case, definitely not.

There aren't a lot of Mongolian places in AZ, but this one is at the bottom of the totem pole, in my opinion. I suggest heading elsewhere.",0
637,"If you want to feel comfortable you have to visit here. The cinder bar will be a friend. They are really great for you and your friend. Just come here and drink with Warren and the Cinder crew.
I strongly recommend the Cinder bar because it has my favourite beers from San Diego; Sculpin and Stone IPA!!",1
638,...single diners are promptly turned away. If you show up with at least one other person you might get a table.,0
639,"I wanted some water for my 2 year old son and was refused. After our meal I challenged the owner about refusing tap water and he said it was not healthy. Probably he meant not healthy for his profit margins. Disgusting attitude.

I am a huge fan of Korean food and have tasted many wonderful dishes in Korea itself. This is without doubt the worst I have ever had. The bulgogi tasted like a Chinese stir fry and the bibimbap was just run of the mill and quite tasteless.

To add to our misery, the owner had a tense and heated meeting with his staff a few tables away from us which made us feel uncomfortable. It just shows how unconsiderate he is. These meetings should take place behind closed doors and away from the public. I felt ever so sorry for the Korean cooks, they looked so sad and downbeaten by the owner’s bully approach.

Birmingham really needs a Korean restaurant. This is not it and you will be wise to avoid it. A huge disappointment.",0
640,"I love Korean BBQ but for whatever reason when I left this place I was just sick to my stomach.  I almost ended up chucking it all back up.
I think it might have been the salmon because the person I was with doesn't eat seafood and he was okie. 
Over all the place was lovely and food was good but I think I'll steer clear of the fish next time.",0
641,"Absolutely great place for a good pint and a really good burger, especially for western flight crews overnighting in ICN.

The best part is that if you're the lucky one who enters the place and happens to be airline employee #100, your bill is free. You just won't know it until it's time to pay the bill.",1
642,"Seen this from day one for a few years.... shopfront looks good.... but find it hard to appreciate the experience and food

First thing .... The food is a bit pricey.... If you want the grill..... It can be a bit expensive... Korea food seems to be a growing trend nowadays. ... but not really for me.....

Food is okay and will not blow you mind.....

Ventilation could be a lot better.... With many tables grilling.... you end up coming out with your clothes smelling of oil...... similar to my Friday night at the local kebab shop....",1
643,"My wife would like to try some Korean food and we found this one near us. We ordered the seafood hotpot recommended by someone else, and we actually felt a little bit disappointment. The quantity was enough for two persons, but most of them are vegetables and tofu. A few seafood inside, such as shrimp.

We still believe it is the best Korean cuisine in Orlando area. Maybe we have not tried its best Korean food yet, and we would like to take another chance later on.",1
644,"the idea of korean BBQ is good but I think it's overpriced, the menu is not diverse enough, (not for the price we are paying 40$ for a friday night), the two time I went there my stomach felt weird afterward, i wasnt sure if it was me who didnt cook the food well or because something is weird with their food or the cooking surface which seems not so clean. We asked the waitress to change it and she had such a bad attitude...anyways not really recommending this place",0
645,"Visited as work colleague recommended for night out. Small restaurant so booking is essential. Service was friendly and attentive, perhaps a touch too fast? Made me think the food was warmed up as it was delivered so quickly. Menu exciting and varied - both Japanese and Korean options and waiter advised on how to choose and select options. Unfortunately I must have chosen a duff off the menu as my Katsu Chicken Udon was far noodles with some deep friend chicken on it. The 'special sauce ' accompanying it was - I swear - Hp brown sauce. Still Udon noodles were tasty. Perhaps I just choose the wrong food but rest of table said things were nice but not great. Unfortunately I think it's a case of a restaurant getting away with serving poor food to a tourist market (it's right near Wicked and Billy Elliot). Touch too expensive for what we got. Would visit one more time to give it a go and try some different food. Takes cards but reluctantly!",0
646,Very crowded restaurant. Staff was not so friendly. After ordering food and drink they soon come and prepare the food in a pan which is in front of you. For me the food was so so and the portion is quite small.,0

The waiter said they don't have any raw garlic and chilli sauce??!! Really? Korean restaurant don't have raw garlic and chilli sauce? It's traditional way to eat the bulgogi beef with raw garlic wrap with lettuce, sounds like this time we walked in to the wrong restaurant!",0
651,"For the price, what you're getting is really great. All you can eat decent sushi and meats. The cooking plates are pretty good, and I really like their beef. The sweet potato roll is also very good.

Come on friday thru Sunday for the desert bar. However ice cream is always served through the week.

My one problem here is that the servers are very slow to respond sometimes. You write your orders down on a piece of paper, very standard, but they hardly come around to pick it up. I always have to waive a guy down.",0
652,"Went here with some friends (5 of us) and we were really impressed. Staff were friendly and talked us through it all, made recommendations and checked up on us regularly. Food was delicious, super fresh meat and seafood. Would definitely recommend.",1
653,"Last Friday night my husband and I were able to try this place.  We say we want to eat there every time we go to the movies.  Well unfortunately,  IT WAS AWFUL...The counter where you make your meal was disgustingly dirty, my rice was watery and when I got my meal it looked like a bowl of mush....something you would feed a bunch of chickens. I had chosen a ton of veggies and fish,  well they destroyed it during the cooking process.  It looked awful and it tasted worse. I also spent the later part of my evening in the bathroom!  (not just me, hubby too) Never again will I eat at Genghis Grill...I actually thought about calling my bank and disputing the charge. This place is nothing short a high end really bad Chinese food restaurant, you know the  ind where you are eating and you know you will regret it later!!!!    YUCK YUCK YUCK...NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!",0
654,I arrived at 9pm to a couple of friendly wait staff in Warren and Owen. I was the only customer until all the flight staff rocked uo at midnight and the local koreans at about 1am. Made to feel like a local. Warren runs a great bar! Highly recommend,1
655,We have now been to this establishment four times. The first was an accident as we were hungry and noticed the sign. Now it is our go-to restaurant. The food is very good but the distinguishing aspect is the service. It is fast and accurate. Though is is often busy the servers are attentive and remember to do what was asked. There is almost no waiting for to get the drink order going and food arrives very quickly. We recommend Korea House highly,1
656,Fresh meat you can bbq yourself on your table! I would say the only problem with this place is they accept cash only!,0
657,"Came here on a Friday night after encountering long lineups at at nearby restaurants, came here and the restaurant wasn't busy at all, in hindsight probably should have clued in at that time.

We ordered two orders of spicy chicken & seafood with cheese and rice cake add on, and with their signature joons spicy sauce, as well as an order of soon do boo. 

It took a while for the food to come out, and the small side dishes were of super tiny portions and lacked variety. They also did not come before the meal like most other Korean restaurants and came with the main...we were already starving ! Weird backwards Korean cuisine imo

The spicy chicken and seafood was disappointing, the dish came out luke warm, and cooled down really quickly. The ingredients also only constituted a very thin layer in the pan.. literally covered only 2cm of it. There was no heating element underneath to keep it warm, the chicken taste was mediocre at best and not very tender and I cant really tell the difference between the regular spicy sauce and their signature join spicy sauce.   Soon tofu was also average, in taste.  

Bottom line: definitely made a mistake coming here, will not come back again",0
658,"Had been wanting to try this place out since it opened a couple of months ago. Finally went there today and was thoroughly disappointed. The food was just ok. Nothing special. The waiter was also not very friendly. The owner or manager, however, was very nice and courteous, which is why I'm giving two stars instead of one. Never going there again",0
659,"I'm unsure whether it was just at the time of our visit that the food tasted poor, or if it's all the time really bad. I ordered the Seafood gal bi / fried rice with cheese, and my rice was very dry. The seafood was overcooked until it shrunk into tiny proportions and I could not tell if it was a squid or prawn or shellfish that I was eating. The food really tasted so so.

However, there's a self serve station for kimchi, soup and shredded cabbage for you to help yourself with. The waitress frying up our food took her time serving others as well hence the very dry fried rice. I didn't know if we're allowed to fry the food ourselves, but when i tried to touch the frying spatula, the waitress hissed at me. I don't know if it's just me or they just don't like tourists. The price however is pretty much cheap compared to other type of restaurants.",0
660,"*3.5 rating*

After reading all the hype about this place I was really eager to try it out. It's a little restaurant with about 10 tables. 

We were greeted with tea, seaweed, green beans and kimchi. For the main course, being a huge bibimbap fan, I ordered the beef bibimbap along with the beef Cupbap. Bibimbap is a very popular Korean dish served with rice, vegetables and an egg in a hot stone bowl. The beef Cupbap was served with sweet potato noodles & rice and heavily dressed with a sauce. Of the two, the bibimbap was definitely a better choice. Both dishes can have more meat especially the Cupbap which hardly had any meat. 

 I have had much better Korean meals and would say this one was decent.",0
661,"great songs, nice mood, good people.. especially the boss warren and friendly staffs!!!
i like cocktail 'moscow mule' and draft beer '420' in this bar.

the bar opens until 8am!!! for customers who want to stay up all night lol",1
662,"Went to Miss Korea with my friend today. We had BBQ between two of us. We ordered mixed beef and pork, and also spare ribs soup with potatoes. They all came in big portion. Great value for money and high quality meat. Nice enviroment and friendly staff. Had a really good time. We will definitely visit again.",1
663,"We popped here for dinner and the food was all lovely. Teriyaki salmon and beef and gyoza and spicy chicken to start. A watermelon juice was also very refreshing. Only problem is the bbq makes you smell of cooking when you leave, maybe better ventilation would help?",0
664,"After reading all the great reviews including the endorsements from my K-Town peeps, I went out on a limb and ordered jajangmyun and Korean fried chicken. Oh no. You guys really let me down. First, it wasn't authentic . . . which I suppose it doesn't have to be, but the recipe and delivery was also poor. I'll give this place another try because quite frankly if you want Korean in Charlotte, your choices are this limited.",0
665,"Went here while visiting Birmingham for Lunch and my Nephew recommend this place, had to walk 20 mins from the car parking but worth doing so. there were lots of parking available opposite this restaurant too. Live barbecue was lovely,, all food were very delicious and portion sizes are good. We all enjoyed a lot. Lovely place,, could do a better in service.We were not even asked how our food was in the entire meal sessioin, but still charged extra as a service charge or don't know what, it only said tax.. but if you charge extra for the service, you have to up your game in sevice, I felt so. Ovderall. very good food, will be back soon.",1
666,Started off goodish they took full order then 5 mins later said had no chicken skewers for starters so we both took chicken dumplings then while ordering food started telling me I was ordering too much I was ordering for 3 people strange. The dumplings were good except one person asked for veg dumpling but got chicken. It’s a birthday she didn’t complain then the bbq food started to arrive but one of hot plates would only go to number two a warm setting when we complained as food was poaching not browning were told they knew it was broken so just use other one for 8 people we asked to move then every member of staff stood round our table telling us it will heat up give it time eventually they tried to intimidate us with restaurant and kitchen crew huddling round us. They said give us 2 separate tables then they were shouting tried to move another table threw the cooking food on top of the raw food aggressively....at that point we said we wanted to leave and they had spoiled his birthday. We found a better staffed restaurant to celebrate and will never eat there again.,1

668,"This place do have great food! The short ribs are great. I would admit that when you do order they all come out in really small portions. So if you do go then double the order, because their costumer service sucks! After our first order they never came back to check on us. It wasn't even busy! I understand if it was, but they didn't have much customers and none of them smile! We had to flag them down every time we wanted something. Also, when we wanted to order more stuff they didn't come out with all our orders. We were missing a few! Other than that the food IS good and the ice cream as well. If you do go to this place, make sure to double the order!",0
669,"This will be the last time our family come back to this place. We have been loyal since Takamatsu to Arirang, and despite of numerous Korean places have just opened in town, we still try to come back. Tonight, the food is the worst ever even though service is good. I ordered Combo 1 and Seafood Tofu soup. All of the meats are poor prepared, sweeter than usual, and leave a bland aftertaste. Onion salad (our favorite) was mixed in a galore of extra MSG and oil. It was hard to swallow. Soup is very bland! Side dishes are too sour and old, especially the kimchi, it tastes so bad! 

I get really pissed to have to pay for over $50 for this meal but only could eat a couple bites. We wont be back!",0
670,"Food are generally good. Tried lunch-Bulkogi-grilled beef and Reimen-cold noodle, which were not bad, or could say even better than expected. Reasonably priced. Served by beautiful waitressesabout, most probably selected ones, who
spoke English and/or Japanese. Rather strange setting, many long and big tables, mainly for group guests. Better ask for a smaller table.",1
671,Good food but way too pricey. The portions are nice and the range is good but I don't make six figures and can get better food for less elsewhere.,0
672,"They prepare everything on a hot plate on the table but Koreans are used to spicy food so you come out smelling like spicy BBQ. I am sure that the food is not bad but after a while everything you taste is spicy, even the water. The second time we asked for non spicy and they still made it spicy. I think that everything is ready in the kitchen and they don't want to make special orders. Their self service water station has hot water but you have to boil it yourself.",1
673,"This is another one of those best kept secrets. Firstly as a westerner you will feel like the only person there, you will be, the place is full of Koreans and some other Asian nationalities. The place is brightly lighten. The menu was interesting, guess there is no real difference between South Korean and North Korean cuisine, either that or we did try some of the more unique offerings. The waitresses are a highlight, wearing very bright almost brides dresses, they are very friendly and speak perfect English........BUT then......they double as the cast of the most fantastic restaurant show I have seen. Loads of fun and just a overall great experience. Go experience, you will not be disappointed. An absolute treat.",1
674,"Food wise, I would say so-so and slightly over priced, ordered 7 dishes (nothing special) with a bottle of soju and cost us more than USD$150. Nevertheless people were mainly here for the performances, it was weird seeing these young and beautiful North Korean ladies performing all kinds of wonderful talents on stage at the same time serving the customers as waitress, poor girls.",0
675,Best bar in Songdo with tons of internationals! Everyone who is visiting this area should consider coming by this welconing bar.,1
676,"First things first, I am a Korean and this is NOT an authentic Korean interpretation of Jjajaangmyun (black bean noodle). It lacks the scorched black bean paste flavor and scent. Noodles are added into the bowl without being drained of liquid fully, making the sauce diluted. Veggies within the sauce has texture but lacks flavor. 

I also had Kaanpoonggi (spicy fried chicken/boneless chunks). In Korea there are regulations on meat ratio to batter and very picky/sensitive eaters so the restaurants have to abide by the rules, but this place seemed like it was majority batter and 30-50% meat(still better than Korea House couple blocks down, 0-20% meat). Sauce had too much oil, as if the fried pieces of chicken weren't drained before being satayed in the sauce. 

Only good thing about the restaurant was the server. Very friendly and honest.",0
677,"Been here for lunch and dinner and I enjoy dinner better because I love cooking on the grill. Love the short ribs and beef. Love the assorted dishes especially the eggplant. Cooking on the grill is super fun.

Which it was in a better location.",1
678,It's far better in Korean town. The fried rice is terrible without flavor. The field chicken is ok but fried too deep therefore hard to bite.,0
679,"Warren, the bartender was very humble and kind, recommending specialty drinks of his and some amazing New Zealand beer stocked in the bar!",1
680,"Have been there recently, went for a booked table. The Soju was amazing (plum)!!! We chose vegetarian and full fat sharing dish, and the spices were brilliant, but all together I missed some more meat. By taste there was nothing to complain about, maybe rather the portion or the mixture of the meat&veg. Definitely will go back, cause I am curious about the grill, what is built in the table in front of you",1
681,"Went here on my own when I was in the area for business. The décor is a bit eclectic and the restaurant is small. Because of this the service was prompt. My order came and the food was great. There was a small problem with my order, which the chef (and owner, I believe) was eager to rectify. After the fix he also brought me a free cup of Miso soup and some amazing honey ginger tea. I loved the kimchi and he was so appreciative of me telling him that. I felt like someone was cooking from their home kitchen and genuinely cared about my experience, and also took pride in their work. I'll go back any time I'm in the area!!",1
682,The food tastes great and the staff are helpful. It was nice to have unlimited refills of Korean tea. Visiting was an enjoyable experience.,1
683,"Easily one of the top three Korean BBQ places I have eaten worldwide (except Korea). If you are in Edinburgh do your self a favor and stop in for an authentic,delicious Korean meal. The owner was incredibly friendly and even gave up one of her tables to let our group spread out. Made a great evening",1
684,"We ordered seafood bibimbap (my favourite, it has a special type of sauce in it, which adds so much to the flavour), deep fried tofu in sweet chilli sauce, kimchi pork, kimchi starter, spinach starter.
All dishes are amazing, very healthy, fresh food, spicy enough bit bot to blow one's mind off.
Highly recommended, my favourite Korean restaurant in whole Birmingham.",1
685,"Terrible. I ate there once 5 years ago and didnt like it. But then I decided to give it another chance. I had the stir fry pork dish and I felt sick and had to run to washroom shortly after that. I don`t know what they used to cook the pork dish. If you dont want to get sick, avoid that place and go to the other korean restaurant right beside it.",0
686,"We visit Korea House when we want a change from our usual restaurants. The food is always good and they do have a limited selection of beer and wine. The food is Korean with some Japanese influences. The kimchi was not killer spicy, the dumplings were tasty, and the bulgogi (beef) was moist and tender. In the past I've had the very tasty but spicy kimchi soup. (Spicy items are clearly marked on the menu.) The decor in this small restaurant is the very home-like, with lots of Korean knickknacks on display. The service is polite and efficient, and the prices are reasonable for Boulder.",1
687,"The Cinder Bar completely bursts at the seams with good vibes, friendliness and spot on tunes.
So many memorable evenings have been had at this spot...with the hosts taking hospitality to the next level. The Fe Fi Fo Fum is the reigning cocktail with an incredible NZ flavour twist...its a must have, seriously buy it now!
If you have the away from home blues or want to neet a new crew stop on by and make this your new local, minutes morph into hours as you literally laugh and drink while attempting to sing and dance that night away.",1
688,"Walking in the place looked nice, but I was soon mistaken because as soon as you get passed the bar, that's when all the horror comes out. We got seated, and grabbed our ticket (WHO USES A STAMP CARD THING? ). 
After we walked through a tiny walk way to get to the back where the buffet line started it was filled with an atrocious aroma of smoke, and heat.
Grabbing the food items looked so unsanitary. The food itself sat in the juices, like they all came from a can. With everyone in front of you touching the same slimey utensils i almost wanted to walk out. The meat was not refrigerated, and was leaky. I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt - regardless of everything my date and I experienced this far. The sauces were pre mixed, and even though you had a variety to choose from, with more than 1 cup to put it in, I still was not satisfied. They were definitely packed with sugar! 
Everything seems regulated, even down to not allowing for customers to pack their noodles in their bowl, which I personally go HAM on! 
When it came time to eat the food it was sooooo grease filled! Not what I expected at all. 

It's also hard to enjoy your food when the employees are constantly bashing their trays, bowls, and other Instruments on the floor when they're done cooking 1 bowl. 

All in all I would say this is not worth the price, time, and a review of 3 or more stars. The extra star I put on there was because of the nice waiter we had. He never let my cup go empty! On that note...try the peach sweet tea!!! Yum! 

Spend your hard earned money at YCs instead!",0
689,"If you shove a bunch of starved people in a restaurant in the apocalyptic world, it would look like this place. 

Don't come here for the quality of food. Come here if you are close to dying of hunger and want to stuff your mouth with somewhat digestible food. 

Our orders were lost and we didn't get some of what we ordered. People who arrived after me got their orders first. The food items that we ordered the first around came an hour later. We didn't have meat until 30 minutes of waiting. This place is just chaos.",0
690,"I have been going for years and have had every item on the menu. The food is extremely fresh and the servers are very polite and friendly. This is very authentic food!
I highly recommend their raw beef and egg yolk dish (yukhoe) as well as their dumplings (gun-mandu) and bibimbap. One of my favorite parts of my dining experience is the little delicious side dishes that come along with the entrees.
I highly recommend this lovely restaurant.",1
691,"My General Tso is crunchy. Wtf

Place is hot
Weird smell
Bad part of town
How is this ranked#1????
Rice iffy",0
692,"Amazing Bar. We spent a lot of time there. Thank you for the great moments we had Warren, Mikey, William and Daniel",1
693,Great bar if you are looking for very friendly English speaking staff who go the extra mile. Music is great and the clientele are fun too. If you are lucky enough someone might ring the bell and that is an experience in itself. Warren the owner is a real character!,1
694,"I tired this place after the reccomendation of a friend.

The restaurant was very nice and I liked the setup despite the uptight snooty atmosphere but hey its Summerlin so what do you expect. The AYCE menu was very dismal in selection and was not impressed by the little they did offer. The quality of the fish was good but they should ditch the AYCE and keep it old school and just offer specials on the rolls.

The service was ok but seeing how we went early before the lunch rush..its should have been better. We never actually got sushi plates which was rather annoying as well.

They did have the Korean BBQ setups at the table so perhaps the wife and I will return and give that a shot when it cools down but til then this is on my no go list.",0
695,We ordered seafood fried rice with rice cakes. The taste was a bit bland - maybe its because we Malaysians like flavourfull food...i dont know... you have to get the sides (which is the kimchi and the cabbage salad) by your own at the counter. The waiter was...okay...not friendly but not rude either.,0
696,"Great to discover you can get tasty, authentic Korean food in Birmingham. Good service and not expensive. Will be back for more.",1
697,"Love the spot, don't love the food.

Maru is a good spot for Korean if you just can't make it to Chinatown.   I've enjoyed their dolsot bibimbap several times and it's one of my favorites in town.  It's a big portion, so, come hungry.  Maru also brings out a decent selection of banchan and they are happy to refill, and refill, and refill....

Their seafood sundubu, however, is another story. It's watery and relatively flavorless.  Especially gross was that all the shrimp in my soup were not de-veined. Sick. The other seafood in the wasn't much better - mostly rubbery and overcooked.

Service can be spotty here, so, if you're looking for attention, steer clear.",0
698,Absolutely lovely. The whole staff is really friendly. The best place to chill and have a beer with your mates.,1
699,"It's a cool concept. I do have to admit that I love coming here, I just wish the food quality was just a lil bit higher.",0
700,"Bad food, even worse service. They only take cash due to evading tax probably. Ordered a lamb meal and it tasted gross. I barely touched it so I complained to the waitress and she could not speak much English and apologised but kept checking with the owner what they could do and all they could offer was 15% off our bill which is a complete rip off as my food arrived 30 mins after my friend has had his food. No apologies about this whatsoever. After a while, the owner came out very rude and arrogant saying they do not care if we don't like the taste of the food as to them it tastes okay. They tasted my leftovers as well. Wtf. Horrible experience. I will not be coming back ever. Probably will put a formal complaint as well after how we were treated.",0
701,Celebrated my birthday here. There was 20 of us. Seated just fine. Only one lady server initially then the second lady came after an hour. Fantastic service and food is served excellently. Will definitely come back again. Price is a bit high but went with great satisfaction.,1
702,A little bar tucked under an apartment building run by super friendly kiwi Warren. Wazza and the crew go out of their way to look after you from remembering your drinks favourites to dishing up excellent bar food as well and even ringing around for other late night bars to find who was open when it was time to move on.,1
703,"I lived in Seoul for almost a decade and this place's food tastes nothing like real Korean food. Overpriced (though I wouldn't eat their food again at any price, even free) and the ""recipes"" have been changed to ""suit American tastes"". Ha.

If you are in Colorado and want food that is more indicative of the cuisine you can find in Korea, I recommend Daegee (either CO location) or Soban in Aurora. Neither is spot on, but they are the closest I've found.",1
704,"Not good at all. Its not an authentic Korean bbq. Its a Korean bbq place but it was owned by a Chinese. They give only two side dish, seaweed salad and kimchi. Although they give large portions of beefs unlimited soda which is good. Only one dessert in the menu which is ice cream (blueberry and green tea only).",0
705,"We normally enjoy Korean food and once upon a time enjoyed this restaurant. But now, the food is unsavory. Even the rice and tea taste bad. And the place is tired and a bit grubby.",0
706,"WHY DID I FEEL LIKE I FELT SOMETHING WRONG AFTER I TASTED SUL LUNG TANG IN THIS RESTAURANT?  I was there had three sul lung tang with my friends, but, the meals were not good tastes and flavors, felt very greased or added some artificial flavors after I ate, also, the side dishes, kimchi and radish- kakdooki were not fresh, I think they might a new ownership or changed the chief.  I wouldn't go that place and no recommend to my friends.",0
707,The Cinder Bar is a great place to go of you're new to Songdo and want to meet up with other foreigners. The staff is super friendly and great to talk to and their burgers are great. The cocktails are also delicious! Highly recommend checking out this place!,1
708,The food was average. I found the management was quite rude to employee. Kimchi was very much below par.,0
709,"I'm a korean, but I wasn't able to feel korean food in this restaurant. I think the owner is a chines, so the taste towards more on chines style than original korean. I had soybean paste stew and Bibimbab. The stew was so salty and less ingredient, I think if they put more tofu or other vegetables in the stew, it would be better. And my friend said the Bibimbab has to much rice and less vegetables and meats. Maybe, I can make better dishes than this restaurant. Also, I don't know why they are only available cash. I had to withdraw money from near ATM...

버밍엄에 한식당이 많이 없어서 기대 했는데 종업원들도 중국인이고, 한식을 잘하는 식당은 아닌것 같습니다. 된장찌개가 짠맛밖에 없어요. 비빔밥은 찌개보다 먹을만한데 같이 간 친구는 밥을 정말 많이 남겼어요.",1
710,"Like korean restaurants, their menu consists of the regular korean dishes for a reasonnable price, such as bibimbap, fried chicken, etc. 

I tried the spicy chicken Cup bap which had chicken, japchae, rice and salad. It's was pretty good but wasn't really spicy. The side dishes were ok, but the kimchi was saltier than expected. 

The place itself is clean and cozy. The waiter was nice and friendly. 

Overall, I don't have much to say about this restaurant. It was good but not good enough for me to go back.",0
711,"Fantastic beer selection Warren and staff are super friendly and welcoming. You can go with your friends, or make friends there. Nothing can compare to this great small bar. Just check it out!!",1
712,I wrote review this restaurant yesterday but the owner deleted it !! 'Gomtang' has yucky smell and they don't serve 'banchan' with regular order. The food is really not fresh.! Please don't go there.,0
713,"What was fresh about this place?  The waitresses' bad attitude and poor service.  3 of us did the AYCE for $26, and 1 person ordered a korean dish.  

First off, when we got seated, the waitress took 3 out of the 4 drink orders, and then walked away. We had to shout the 4th drink order.  After we ordered our AYCE sushi items (limited to one order of sea urchin (uni) and 1 order of sweet shrimp, we waited... and waited... for our food. The appetizers like the tempura and gyoza were fine, although I had to ask for tempura sauce.  What place does not bring tempura sauce with tempura? This should have been a red flag, as I had to ask for it. The rest of the sushi came out very very slow, especially for being nearly empty on a friday night at 7pm.  
Finally the first sushi order (tuna) came out.  It's one thing if the sushi looks like it got rolled over by a car and died 2 weeks ago, but it actually tasted like it died 2 weeks ago and got rolled over by a car, and then sliced and put on top a very hefty wad of mushy rice.  It was tasteless.  The lack of flavor was attempted to be hidden by the sushi chef adding a clump of wasabi underneath.  
The rice quality was nothing that great either. It was a step above the quality of rice found at the supermarket.  
Everything else that came out had no flavor and there was a lack of excitement about the food.  
We had to wait 90 minutes before we finally got fed up, and said, where is our uni?!  The manager in charge said he would go check.  He came back a couple minutes later saying it would be out in a couple minutes as they just opened up a new box.  (Really?  they couldn't have opened up the new box when we ordered the food?)  The uni was fine, nothing horrible, but nothing that great either.  
The last sushi order they brought out was the white tuna which I usually like, but it was just horrible.  It was warm, melted in your mouth (not because it was good quality, but because it was just so waterlogged), and it had a weird almost alcoholic flavor to it. I spit it out and sent it back via the waitress who plainly ignored me until another waitress came by.  They were also very slow at servicing our table as we would stack our own plates to make room.  We also had to constantly ask for tea, but at least they kept my friend's soda cup full.  
My korean friend told me that her korean dish was awful as well. She only ate half of it.  
Overall, this restaurant is horrible.  The korean food is not good, and neither is the sushi.  1 star was given because that's the bare minimum that must be given and inside the restaurant looked very nice and modern.   This place does not deserve to serve sushi.",0
714,"This Bar has the most amazing customer service, hands down. The drinks are reasonably price and as all the reviews continue to say the wings are out of this world. Warren is an amazing owner offering hotel pick up and customer service. After discovering Cinder Bar it became my go to spot. When you enter you are one of the family. Order the Hendricks and tonic amazingly prepared. Thank you Warren for making my Korea experience so amazing.",1
715,We were excited to try Spice. The menu is cool and my chicken sandwich was good when it finally came. My wife had Pad Thai that was mediocre. The issues began with our appetizers which didn't arrive until AFTER the entrees. We sat waiting for half an hour for the appetizers... nothing. No sign of our very young very inexperienced wait person during that whole time. When the petizers arrived after we had started our entree we sent them back. Then the waitress reappeared and gave a Shakespearean monologue of exaggerated remorse. Th girl would not stop apologizing although we were obviously trying to eat. A disaster. I would not go back -- there are plenty of restaurants out there... but,0
716,"Service is not good. The food tastes flat. The ambiance is somewhere between a sports bar, a mongolian BBQ and a cheap chinese restaurant. The drinks are not good and prepared by non-professional barmen and barwomen. I had to ask for the bowls to be replaced because they were dirty and the waitress didn't see anything wrong!!! For the same money I can have better food across the street at Pei-Wei.",0
717,"Had heard great things about this place and the menu had us drooling. When we arrived the staff were welcoming and there was a nice buzz to the place. We ordered a drink whilst we waited for our pals but by the time they had joined us and finished their drink too, we had to leave. Unfortunately we were overwhelmed by the odour.

The problem is that this place is Korean BBQ, so you cook your own food at the table. Sounds like a great idea but not when there is little or no ventilation. We were there for less than 30mins but our clothes stank of fried food / oil for the rest of the night.

Considering this is a fairly new venue, it is not going to smell any better with time, especially with the wood paneling and cloth covered chairs. A commercial kitchen is not allowed to open without proper ventilation so I have no idea how this place remains open without the same in the dining room.

Such a shame !!",0
718,"I was in the area for a meeting this morning and met up with friends who worked nearby after to grab lunch. A bit of spicy Korean was definitely in order given the -10째 weather. Even though Joons is known for their dakgalbee, an awesome carb-y combo of rice cake, cheese, and rice and/or ramen, we opted against it this time around so they wouldn't have to go back into the office smelling like spicy cheese. Instead, we ordered the vegetable soft tofu soup, bulgogi noodles, and the spicy chicken rice. My friend originally wanted to warm up with some pork bone soup, but they didn't have it ready yet when we got in shortly after 11:30. We were told the wait would be about an hour for it, which I guess is a mixed blessing as any soup that takes an hour plus to prepare must be relatively authentic. The food was pretty good, but the conversation was better. My favourite was the spicy chicken rice and Joons' mashed potato side dish. Prices are great, lunch for under $15 with tax and tip, but they don't accept credit here, only debit and cash. The meal was fine while we were eating, but settled heavily and a bit uncomfortably a couple hours later, just something to keep in mind - and I have a pretty cast-iron stomach!",0
719,"Excellent new addition in Tollcross. Have ordered a take away twice now and enjoyed the food both times.
Please give it a try if you are in the area.",1
720,"This restaurant doesn't seem to understand the seriousness of food allergies. I have a very serious - potentially life-threatening - nut allergy so when we arrived I specifically told the waiter that I had a nut allergy when we ordered our mains, and asked him to go and check that the food didn't have nuts in.

After we'd eaten our main meal (which was delicious - best bibimbap in London!), I asked a waitress for the dessert menu. She said there was just green tea icecream for dessert, so we ordered some. When it came, I tried some and I thought it had nuts in - which the staff confirmed - although they hadn't felt it necessary to mention when I ordered! I thought this was really poor, particularly as I'd explicitly let them know about my allergy.

Fortunately, I only ate a tiny quantity of the ice-cream, so I didn't have a serious anaphylactic allergic reaction, just stomach cramps and some difficulty breathing. But someone with a more serious allergy than mine could easily have died from that - so Lime Orange needs to do a lot better to support its customers with allergies.

I really wouldn't recommend eating here if you have serious food allergies!",0
721,"The food was OK, not great. Seems like years ago there was another Korean restaurant here that was much better. I am not a big fan of a minimum credit card charge, especially a $10 minimum. So for one at lunchtime you need to spend $10 so the owner can save a few cents.
It is a shame because this restaurant could be so much better.",0
722,"Main bar for foreigners, having fun and learning english! The stuff is amazing, always a warm welcome. You can spend the whole night without being dissapointed. A place for going every week at least twice",1
723,Great place to just relax and meet friends. Very friendly atmosphere. Foreigners welcome!!! Thank you Cinder Bar!!!,1
724,"We had high hopes and expectation for the place and it did not disappoint us at all. The flavours were good and we loved the BBQ dishes we have been craving for. We ordered a portion of the raw beef (Yuk Hwae) and wow! Thanks to other reviewers, we were dressed prepared for the smoky BBQ environment and had we not been warned, we would have been pretty annoyed if we had turned up in our Sunday best only to find we needed to literally strip as we walked into our home and everything went into the wash and bodies in the shower! However, if you are prepared, it really is worth it. The only criticism is the ""excuse"" of the card machine being ""still"" out of order, we wondered if it had ever worked. We thought it would have given a better impression to simply state cash only up front as it would not deter us from eating there again at all. The food itself is enough to draw in customers.",1
725,"The best korean restaurant in Prague. I like how all of the staff speak korean, however the waiting time is too long. Much better for dinner than lunch.",0
726,Don't understand the 10% tax or I think it's a tip added because they accept cash only :). The food is in small portion so need to order loads.,0
727,"Had lunch on a Wednesday.  It was pretty much dead.  Ordered the hot stone bowl with seafood, tofu and spicy broth.  It was decent as I think the broth was lacking flavour.

I'll come back and give it a second chance before I write the place off.  Lots of good reviews so it deserves another look.",0
728,"I wanted to try Jumak for quite some time and I'm not disappointed. The place can allow about 20 people. The menu is presented with a scroll, nice way to display a menu.

There were no one when I arrived. I've ordered a seafood pancake (haemul pajeon), a pork bone soup (gamja tang) and a spicy tofu and seafood soup. 

All were delicious. Overall I'm satisfied with this Korean restaurant. The only thing that you need to be aware is that they don't accept credit card.",0
729,"My year living in Songdo would have been very different without Cinder bar. Warren makes great drinks and the atmosphere is very relaxed with lots of friendly people. If you're in Incheon looking for a relaxed bar with great drinks, great people, and great food Cinder is the place to go!",1
730,"Location - Central, directly opp Arcadian car park

Atmosphere - V friendly staff, really welcoming it's quite modern but as though it's been done on the cheap so I wouldn't recommend as a romantic venue.

Food - I had never tried Korean food and enjoyed the different flavours. We didn't go for anything in the BBQ menu (where the meat is cooked at your table) but wish we had given it a try.

All in all, nice flavours, fresh food, a tad greasy - give it a try!",1
731,"Cinder bar has a great vibe and the owner Warren went out of his way to chat with us. The drinks were all made from scratch and were better than any other place that I have been to Incheon. If you are in Songdo, then this is definitely the place to go for good drinks and a good time.",1
732,The only reason it gets one star is that is as low ad I can go. After sitting for 30 minutes and getting next to no service I finally left. Worst service I have ever experienced.,0
733,"Pretty great!

Let me start by saying how excited I am that Vaughan FINALLY has a Korean restaurant (even if its ramen). I also don't understand why so many reviews complain about the price. The average ramen bowl at any given restaurant goes for $12-13 and Mo' Ramyun serves ramen in GIANT bowls, hence the price tag. 

We came here on a Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty empty. Although it looks deceivingly small from the outside, there is a large dining room and even a patio (which will hopefully open in the summer). The menu is also fairly large (contrary to some complaints), there are Ramyun bowls and Dry Ramyun plates (noodles with no broth). The menu also has some appetizers worthy of checking out, like the fried tofu. 

We ordered the Mo' Ramyun ($15.99) which came with BBQ pork, grilled pork belly, and a lot of vegetables. The broth itself had a nice smokiness to it, which makes the dish really addicting. The only complain I have is that whoever cut the vegetables needs to improve their knife skills. The pieces were chunky and very uneven. We also ordered the Jajang Ramyun ($9.99 for a small) and the Jajang (black bean sauce) was not thick enough. The Age Tofu ($6.99) was great, although there was nothing aged about it. 

The service was fast & kind. The only issue I had was that the waiters stared at the patrons as they were eating. Not sure how the others felt, but it made me slightly uncomfortable. 

Overall, a decent restaurant with adorable decor and good dishes. Not a typical Korean restaurant (no banchan), but the portions make up for that. I think there is a lot of room for improvement, but given that it is a new restaurant, I hope that the owners take all the reviews into account.",0
734,"Tried to eat here for lunch on Friday... we went in the wrong door so had to walk through the entire restaurant to get to the host station and walked by at least a half a dozen empty tables.  The hostess went to the back to find out which waitress to sit us with and came back and said that it was a 20 min wait???  I get the kitchen may be backed up, but at least offer to sit us and just disclose that the kitchen is backed up and we might have to wait longer than normal for food.  So we walked across the street and ate at Carolina Ale House.

They lost my business...  won't be going back here!",0
735,"Great food! Super slow service! Be aware of the long wait

When you come in, you can seat yourself and do not waste time waiting for a host. When we came in around 7pm, they weren't busy so they told us we can sit wherever we want. But during our time at the restaurant, it got filled pretty quick and people were coming in, we saw them waiting to be seated for a long time before the waitress get a chance to stopover and tell them seat themselves at the bar or any table. 
We were really happy with the food but not the service. Our appetizer came out very fast but it took a very long time for the entry. 
Ordered Chicken kasu, it is fried chicken with house bbq sauce. 10/10 crispy batter and well seasoned chicken. Madu, we got the pork ones. I would say they are 7.5/10. It is essentially fried dumplings. The dipping sauce is sour and spicy/sweet, but the filling were a little bit dry. For entry, we got BBQ combo, 8.5/10, it came with 3 kinds of bbq, kabi ribs, bogogi and grilled pork. I like the beef better than the pork. The pork turned out a little dry but the beef were very juicy, tender and flavorful. Also the BBQ combo comes with two small side plates, it includes kimchi, radish and pickled cucumber. 

As I was saying the slow service, we waited long time to get it, even people came in after us ordered the same thing and had their entry for a while and we were still waiting. After we finished our meal, we waited long time for the check, even we try get eye contact so that our waitress would notice that we are ready for a check. Not very effective. Eventually, we were able to get her attention by waving. 

I'm not sure if I would come back to do a sit down dinner anymore. We had to wait too long for a Tuesday night, I can't imagine any other days that could be less of a wait. Maybe takeout next time?",0
736,"The Food was excellent , the best food we ever had. The staffs was so lovely , friendly and very welcoming. The price is so reasonable and would recommend to anyone.",1
737,"I had one of the most stressful airport experiences I’ve ever dealt with, left the airport to find some drinks/food and stumbled across The Cinder Bar. The owner and his amazing bartender from Vietnam completely turned around my entire day. 5 minutes in I had a huge smile in my face from the friendliness of the staff. I had some drinks which were all great prices and a burger which was delicious. Perfect for if you have a layover that’s long enough to leave the airport but not long enough to go too far. Incredible place!",1
738,"TL:DR - Basically 30 bucks for good Korean BBQ and Sushi Buffet

I've been to an AYCE Korean BBQ place.  I've been to an AYCE sushi place.  But I've never been to an AYCE Korean BBQ and Sushi place.  Unfortunately for me, I wasn't prepared to come otherwise I would've worn some looser fitting clothes.   We wanted to go to a place down the street but our group was too big for them to accommodate.  So we naturally followed the crowd and saw the line at Seoul Chako and decided to eat here instead.  Luckily for us, the place is big and was able to take our group after a short wait.

This place is perfect for a bunch of meat hungry guys.  Hmm, that did't sound right.  Nevertheless, you pick from menu with well over a dozen different kinds of meat and seafood.
Each order comes in a small bowl with a small portion for you to cook yourself on a grill that's built into your table.  There's no limit on the amount that you can order so as long you eat it all other wise you'll be charged extra.  All the meats I tried were good, tender, and well marinated.  Everything on the sushi menu, although limited, was good and above average for a buffet.  

My only gripe was our server.  He was slow with our drinks and food and some of requests were met with a eye roll.  Not sure if he hates his job or was just repulsed by the amount of food that us Americans were throwing down but he did not look like he wanted to be there.  

Regardless, this is one of MANY restaurants along St. Catherine but should be up among the places you should try especially if you're trying to accommodate a big group.",0
739,Best Bar in Korea so far! I had an amazing time with Warren! Don't hesitate and ask for some NZ beers and some rock songs! :-),1
740,"Had the Spicy Chicken (Dak Gal Bi) with noodles and sliced rice cakes. 

The total came out to be about $11 per person before tax and tip.

Here is why i rated this restaurant very low:

1. The dish is called Spicy Chicken (Dak Gal Bi), but you barely get any. I think I counted about 7 small pieces per person. Maybe they should rename the dish... to Spicy Noodles with Chicken. Also the chicken was bland. I'm pretty sure it was not marinated, but rather raw chicken cooked first, then sauce added on top.

2. There were barely any other ingredients - not much cabbage, green onions, etc. The dish is predominantly Instant Noodles and rice cakes. This is fine and dandy, but for $11, it is not worth it at all. I mind as well make my own instant noodles for $1, and order KFC. You'll get alot more food.

3. Service was bad - I had to call for the waitress multiple times. I went on a Saturday night (9 PM), and the restaurant was only 33% full.

4. Before anyone judges my review as too critical, I'm Korean and I cook/order Dak Gal Bi frequently. Also normally you get alot more chicken and vegetables, with noodle as a side and not the main. If the instant noodles is the main, then $11 is a rip off.",0
741,"Second visit here. Tuesday night and it's packed!
Last time, we got a BBQ for two, and starters, we only just managed to eat all this!!

This time, I opted for a stew, my ptnr went for some sort of spicy chicken thing, and we had dumpling starters and a kumchi side.

As last time, we got three different salads that came with the food, free refills of same which we made use of. Dressings in salad all different but are lovely sweet/sour/salty combos, go with everything!

Lots of Korean diners, and other folk who know their stuff, but I think you would be well looked after if you hadn't a clue - staff checked we were ok both visits, and checked if we wanted chopsticks or knife fork spoon.

Be aware that in common with many Korean restaurants, your clothes and hair will smell after!! Don't wear anything like a doen jacket that needs special cleaning.

We recently went to another, new, Korean bbq in Edinburgh but this place totally outguns it! 2 starters, 2 mains, side salads come with it, and we got a drink each, £40 total.",1
742,"I've been here once before, and I just went here again with a party of 25 for a Yelp International Supper Club event. 

This is not the best Korean restaurant I've been to, but it's one of the only ones in Charlotte, a city with an unfortunate lack of Korean food. It has a fairly extensive menu. I've tried one of the soups, I forget which one, the bibimbap, and a bunch of appetizers. The appetizers are the best part; the kimbap and wings are especially good. The bibimbap is only OK, but I think this dish is never that great. 

I also need to complement the service. There were just two servers tonight for a party of 25, and everything came out very quickly. 

Since this place is right next to a Blue Line station, I expect to be back here semi-regularly.",0
743,"In a land of cookie cutter bars and franchises, this quaint bar stands out and demonstrates how to ""do it right"". Take all of the items from a normal bar, add a superior sampling of alcohol choices and a friendly staff who bring customer service to the next level. Mix these things together and you get a bar that performs, where the seats are always warm because nobody wants to leave. Awesome place. I'm glad it is in Songdo because if it were anywhere else, this place would have a line spilling out into the street and you'd never get a seat. The music is top notch as well.",1
744,"The Cinder Bar is my favourite bar in Incheon! They make amazing Gin and Tonics. The owner, Warren, is welcoming and friendly. He takes time to get to know you, even when the bar is packed from their awesome live bands! It's full of amazing people who are looking to have a good time!",1
745,"In Korea for Presidents Cup and went to The Cinder Bar after dinner. Great bar with a really fun atmosphere. The owner and bartender, Warren, goes out of his way to make sure every customer has fun and the gin & tonics are out of this world. If you are in this area and want a relaxing drink, go see Warren at the Cinder Bar.",1
746,"My second visit to a hidden treasure Nice modern decor without being ostentatious. I love the barbecues recessed into each table allowing customers to cook their own food. You can't get any fresher than that. Vegetable dumplings, vegetable fritters and squid in spicy sauce followed by pork, squid and prawns cooked on the barbecue. Fantastic quality food at a very reasonable price. Definitely one to check out and try again. Bring lots of friends",1
747,"I guess you have to expect to pay for the kind of quality you get at The Cinder Bar. Burgers are really good, and they have beer above the standard weak lagers. Worth the price every once in a while!",1

The Owner Warren and his staff - Daniel, Mikey and Chris ( to name a few) know how to take care of their guests.
You will be surprised how they will remember your name and drink even with a packed bar.
Excellent drinks
But do recommend -
Fish and Chips
The flying chef burger
Worth the time, money and experience",1
749,"I travel to Korea often on business so am fairly familiar with authentic Korean food. I was looking forward to eating here and seeing how the food in Birmingham compared with Seoul.

Firstly, none of the staff are Korean. Not that this in itself is a bad thing, but it would be nice to have some Korean staff in a Korean restaurant instead of all Chinese. All of the staff were friendly and efficient though, so we had no complaints with the service.

I found the food to be a disappointment though. While they had many of the normal Korean favorites, our food tasted very bland compared to authentic Korean. We ordered bulgogi, which didn't come with any of the normal side dishes, we even had to ask for lettuce.

If you had never been to a Korean restaurant before, then this place would be fine. But if you've already been exposed to proper Korean food, then you're probably going to end up disappointed.",1
750,"I like it. It's okay. I did see one of the cooks touch food with his bare hand, though. But really, the chicken is pretty good but I hope it gets better!!!",0
751,"Good option of bar for everyone in this city; not just foreigners but also koreans; I am a korean.this bar has all the kinds of drinks you can imagine. The drink prices are very good and the food prices are great too! Warren, the owner, speaks English and Korean so he talks to everybody. He is so popular that he could be the future mayor of Incheon.

The music here is always good and the service is always excellent. You have to come here.",1
752,"I was craving for Korean food and couldn't find it anywhere in Muscat. Then was told by one of Asian friend about this place and I cannot get enough of the food over here!!!
Staff is easy going and very much approachable. And the food -- Yummmmm!
Try the Kimchi fried rice it's surprisingly tasty!",1
753,"Having experienced Korean BBQ before in major US cities and a few times in Toronto. I was really looking forward to see what all-you-can-eat Seoul Chako had to offer my taste buds. 

Lets start by complimenting the trendy atmosphere they have created with an inviting dining area, music playing in the background and lights dimmed just right. Seating area is a mix of tables and booths and all designed with built-in natural gas BBQ grills where the main action takes place. The staff is well coordinated during busy hours, friendly and mostly english speaking. Now for the menu... 

Where most Korean restaurants would require a tour guide to walk you thru the complexity of their menu. This one is kept simple with a few choices of marinated and non marinated slices of meat, shellfish, a limited option on appetizers / side dishes (normally called Banchan) and only one soup option (two if you didn't know miso was Japanese). Everything is served with steamed rice, one spicy sauce (Ssamjang) and a lack of all the common condiments like fresh garlic you would find elsewhere. Also, the popular way of eating Korean BBQ is with lettuce wraps but unfortunately this will cost you an extra $1.50 per order. Sliced lamb is also available on the evening menu over the weekend. Sushi is also on the weekend menu but at this point I would stick with the Korean stuff. If not familiar with Korean BBQ you want to order ALL appetizers / side dishes and mostly stick with beef, short ribs and pork for a great meal.

Although an overall good experience the menu itself could use a little more authentic Korean options. They just recently open so there's room for improvement and get their liquor license issue straightened.

Great...
All-you-can-eat and do it yourself experience. 

No so great...
Lettuce and beverages are extra's. May rush you out on a busy Saturday night. Avoid tables near the front door or really close to a speaker if this is an intimate night out.",0
754,Went here with friends and for birthdays. Loved everything about it the food is amazing and at brilliant value. Would recommend for people who are curious about Korean food,1
755,"Our server Daisy was awful. walked up & asked for drinks then told my friend & i to go help ourselves. did not even ask if it was our first time in (which it was) & did not explain how the ordering process works. we had to follow other people & figure it out on our own. bathrooms are absolutely disgusting, fecal matter was all over the toilet seat. daisy never came back to our table then proceeded to give us our check soon after receiving our food without asking how our meal was or if we wanted any dessert. there are better stir fry places out there, i do not recommend here.",0
756,"We had a mixed bbq and it tasted amazing, and was reasonably priced considering how much meat you got, and it included 2 beers. Service was also very fast, and both the waitresses were very nice and were just the right amount of attentive. Couldn't recommend you try this place enough.",1
757,"I came here 3 times with friends and had great experiences with this place. I loved bbq pork cooked by myself on the electric barbi, and the spicy kimchi soup. The staffs were very friendly and helpful too. I know I definitely need to wash my hair after leaving the restaurant but I will certainly go back again and again!",1
758,"We enjoyed our dinner a great deal. We thought the restaurant was very well priced and chose the Beef B selection for 2. We also got an order of Kim, Kimchi and Hot Beef Soup to share. We loved it all. The beef selection came with three types and they gave us three sides/lettuce/sesame oil with salt and chili paste. All were YUMMM. I had to order white rice as it doesn't come with the order, which from other places I've been to globally that was weird. My water glass came out with food on it, which was gross, but the server replaced it. We asked for a pitcher of water, but that never came. When it came time to pay it was hard to get a server and the restaurant at this point was not full. I would recommend the food and would go back for the food but the service could do a bit better.

Green Tea Ice cream was yummm and on point to what we had in Japan.",1
759,"We came here for dinner last Saturday around 7.15pm. It was full, and we snagged the last two bar seats before others came in and had to wait 20-30 mins for a table/bar seats. The place was very brightly lit providing a welcoming ambience. We started with the scallop pancake and the rice cakes. The pancake was a little dark for our liking,  but it tasted good. The rice cakes were disappointing. They were just pieces of starch in some spicy sweet sauce, but after the first one or two pieces, it got very boring. There needed to be something else to provide a textural contrast. We didn't finish this dish. For mains, we had the mixed grilled meats and the kimchi fried rice. The mixed grill came with a side of ban chan. The meat was very soft and well seasoned, while the kimchi fried rice was tasty, but a little too oily. Service was ok throughout, but servers did seem a little cold at times. They had some really cool cocktails that might be worth a try. Overall, decent experience, but we probably won't be running back to eat there again. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.",0
760,We went here a week or so ago after purchasing a Groupon.We got the bulgogi ($25) and kimchee soup ($10). The food was fine but over-priced. I don't think I would go back. There are better Korean restaurants that are more reasonably priced.,0

764,This was my first time having Korean Food. I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is very clean and the service is excellent. We began with a vegetable pancake that was very good especially with the hot sauce that came with it. My chicken was spicy and perfectly cooked. There were small dishes of Korean vegetables that were all new to me. Some I liked while others were too new for me to really evaluate. I am very pleased I went and will go back the next time I am in Sanford. The experience is well worth it.,1
765,I was invited last minute for a quick bite with friends. This being my first time here was pretty neat. I ordered bulgogi and the plate size serving was big enough for me to finish with a side bowl of rice. The space had big pictures of the noodle bowls being displayed on the left wall since the menu had no pictures of the food on it. The TV showed the Korean news and my group was the last ones to leave this spot.,0
766,"This location is kinda gross.  Dining area isn't well kept, neither is the food area. Employees acted like we were interrupting their social hour.

Skip it.",0
767,"Decent Korean food. Service is ok - seems like a fairly new restauranteur team, so some of the sequencing was a bit off.
For example we ordered 2 starters, but one came after we’d started the main course, so we sent it back. And my wife’s main course came a few minutes after mine, which we had to flag.
However the team of waitresses were well dressed, and couldn’t do enough to help once they had realised their mistake.
So overall, decent food, a friendly restaurant team. They just need to improve some of their sequencing.
Overall Miss Korea is a good edition to Birmingham’s burgeoning Asian restaurant quarter.",1
768,Warm friendly pub with an excellent selection of beers. This place is a must visit if you want more than a Cass.,1

Overall We were disappointed with the food and service here.",0
770,"If you have a spare evening in Phnom Penh don't miss a visit to North Korea! This unusual restaurant serves Korean favorites followed by a vivid floorshow.

Operated by a department of the North Korean regime, the restaurant provides a source of hard currency, a venue for propaganda and possibly more nefarious activities that benefit the DPRK.

The large banqueting hall is brightly illuminated and decorated in what might be described as ""synthetic wedding party"".

The food, conveniently pictured in a photo menu, was abundant, savory, and featured barnyard, sea and kennel-to-table (yes, dog meat) Korean favorites. Service, provided by attractive young women who also perform, was pleasant and fast, a necessity considering the imminent start of the show.

The fifty minute floorshow featured most of the all-female wait staff singing, dancing and expertly performing on a wide variety of traditional and modern instruments with an ear singeing, over-amped audio output.

Most of the guests in this busy eatery were Korean men, but Westerners and some families were in attendance. Communication with the staff is challenging absent Korean or Khmer, and one needs to accept the presence of smokers, ""minders"" and surveillance. Was that a camera overhead in the women's toilet?",0
771,"Favourite Korean joint! I love the dakgakbi(joons special) chicken version. It's basically chicken veggies and their famous sauce in one pan. You have to order a minimum of 2 orders. You can also add sides, I recommend adding the ramen, cheese and rice cakes. Perfect for 2 people. If you come with a party of 4 I would recommend ordering separate orders as I find the portion not as much. The joons special is awesome and full of flavour. They also give a few side dishes( kimchi, beans, mash (super creamy and sweet- always get seconds) I have also tried their pork bone soup and kimchi fried rice- not a big fan I think it lacks flavour. Overall, I would recommend this place and to order the special!",0
772,"Terrible service! Rude waiter and waitress! When we had difficulty understanding what a particular waiter was trying to tell us in Korean, he kept repeating the same thing in Korean over and over again without making an attempt to seek help from his fellow colleague who could speak basic English. We were exasperated even before the start of a meal. We asked for the WIFI password and the waitress replied “NO WIFI” in a mono tone and gave us an expressionless look. Very unfriendly. To top it all, the food was not fabulous. Our 1st and last time there.",0
773,"Tiny bit off the main thoroughfare, and the frontage I think conceals a bit that the interior is really quite nice, but not to be missed.

Korean bbq is great because there's nothing like cooking the meat yourself then popping it in your mouth while it's still toasty hot. Vegetables also cook nicely too.

Staff were charming and very attentive. Nice touch that the chef popped out to check on everyone. Really surprised at the bill given how much meat we ate. We didn't drink much but it still felt good value.

We had the assorted meats bbq, and it was all great. Marinaded strips of beef were particularly nice. Will look forward to bulgolgi and bibimbap next time (other Korean specialties).

We couldn't eat everything, and they suggested themselves that we just cook up the rest and take it home. I often wish I could do that at restaurants but I'm too embarrassed to ask.",0
774,"Over the years their menu has changed and as well as the décor. Their menu appeared to have more selection. The staff was pleasant and welcoming. They will ask you if you want a table with the stove grill or a standard table. We got the standard. I ordered a Gimbap for an appetizer. It is their take on a sushi roll. It was quite good. My wife had the Dolsot Bibimbap which is a veggie mix with Kimchi in a hot bowl. It also had an egg in it. I had the Sundubu Tziigae that is a hot pot with seafood and tofu. The taste was great but only 1 shrimp, 1 piece of squid and a tiny piece of probably octopus. They did refill the little dishes of kimchi items; service was very good. Overall I felt the quality and portions dropped. Korean dishes have been a favorite of ours for some time.",0
775,"I always go to Yoogane at least once whenever I visit Myeongdong. The food and rice are okay. It's a pretty busy place, and always full of people, so I suggest going here at around 11am to be make sure you are seated at once.",1
776,"A small restaurant, but the food is so good, and I like the decoration here. I like the BBQ here (especially the flavoured chicken) and the starters. Kimchi is authentic too. Sushi and rolls (I like the lion king roll) are ideal options beside the beef bibimbap!",1
777,"Wanted some spicy Korean dakgalbi while hanging out in Myeongdong and all everything seems to be pointing towards YOOGANE.
Pressto this shop has very delicious and spicy chicken and octopus galbi.
Super texture and wrap it up with side dish of fried rice which soaks up all the goodness from the galbi. The shop has rotating team that comes every 3 mins to stir fry your plate which means you get 3-4 different person frying your galbi. Get your own unlimited kimchi and salad bar at the corner and the kimchi is GOOD.
Went there again as was hooked to the GALBI.",1

781,"My friend and I went to Lime Orange on a Friday evening for a pre-theatre meal. I was very excited about dining here due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Google. However, we left feeling disappointed and did not feel like we had our Korean food fix.

We started with the kimchi jeon (pancake), which was sickly sweet. The pancake was loaded with spring onions and very little kimchi. With the negligible amount of kimchi in the pancake, they might as well rename the dish 'spring onion pancake with traces of kimchi'. My friend and I joked about the chef mistaking sugar for salt.

My main was a seafood soup dish with rice. It was ok but nothing memorable; hardly any seafood, apart from the tiniest pieces of squid.

We ordered green tea ice cream for dessert. The ice cream was drizzled with lots of strawberry sauce. This was not described in the menu. They should have served it on the side. The sauce was super sweet. Fortunately, the waiter was happy to replace the ice cream, this time without the sauce. The ice cream itself, although very enticingly described in the menu, was not good at all. It wasn't smooth and had bits of ice in it. It tasted cheap.

Overall, very very disappointed. We went to Lime Orange with high expectations, but the food for us was unfortunately a bit meh...",0
782,"They have traditional Korean dishes and then there's the huge pots u see on everyone's tables. So how it works is you order per person. So if you're 3 people, you'll order 3 orders/person of one pan you all decide on unless u all want different ones (they have seafood chicken and beef to chose from). I dislike how you can't order extra noodles which I guess makes sense because they say it's per person but the portions here are so tiny. I'm not exactly sure how they are portioning but it's never enough and actually very little, although very good which is why we always return despite the tiny portions. So you don't necessarily have to order noodles either. Some people just get the proteins with the sauce. After your done eating it, save a bit of sauce and protein etc left and order fried rice. You pay based on bowls or per person. It tastes like bibimbap. I'm giving this place 4 stars because it is delicious and I always return. Would be 5 stars but they lose one due to tiny portions and being a bit pricy for the amount of noodles you get, which isn't filling.",0
783,"The waiter of this restaurant was extremely ARROGANT and went totally psycho when two of us asked whether we could sit at a table of 4 when there is only one table taken by two guests in the entire restaurant with about 10 tables total. He owner said IT WAS THEIR LUNCH TIME and they did not want 2 guests to sit at a table of 4. I asked then why the other two guests were sitting at a table of four. he said because they were Americans. At that moment my friend and I just wanted to get food and leave but his rudeness was not done yet. When we ordered and asked about lunch special, the owner said NO, IT IS NOT LUNCH TIME! Then I asked:""When is your lunch time then?"" He got pissed and asked us to leave. OMG! This is horrible.

I promised we were not being arrogant or anything. At the beginning I was thinking his rudeness might be a result of his limited English, as an immigration I should have more patience and sympathy. But no, i was wrong. He was rude and the reason he refused us what he served with the two white Americans was because we are not white.

Although I did not have the chance to dine here, I got a chance to glance at their menu. It was pricy compared to many other Korean restaurants in this area. And they don't have many typical Korean dishes on their menu. So it might be a good thing we were driven out of this place.

It was my first time ever to write a review about anything online. I just feel there are so many hard working restaurant owners and waiter/waitresses to be supported and this kind of people should run out of business if they are not changing their attitude.

Avoid this restaurant.",0

787,"Three of us went for dinner, having the kimchi pancake (very generous with the kimchi, and not too spicy if that’s something you’re worried about), the BBQ Set D and the Naengmyun (Cold noodles in a vinegar broth). The pancake was delicious and probably the best I have had outside of Korea! And the set includes a variety of 5 cuts of meat (the pork neck slice is especially tender and delicious) and 2 beers of your choice, this was an extremely generous portion and undoubtedly worth the price - a great option if you’re new to KBBQ and aren’t sure what cuts to order. The set also comes with all you need for Ssam (lettuce wraps) and the side dishes are also of a great quality (and are refilled for free if you ask). The naengmyun is also probably the best I’ve ever had, I highly recommend!! The service was great - very attentive and friendly, explaining how to use the bbq and changing out the grill halfway through to a cleaner one (something I was very impressed by, as many Korean restaurants don’t do that in the U.K). Overall I was extremely impressed, and would even consider it the best Korean restaurant I’ve been to outside of Korea!",1

I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant it is worth the drive from Orlando.",1

792,"Since moving to Korea in January 2017, this is by far the best spot in the area!! There is a great mix of local, expats and travelers passing through Incheon/Songdo leading to a ""never know who you might run into"" evening.

The location is a bit hidden for a first-timer, but that adds to the mystique. Once there, the interior is intimate and welcoming. There's also additional seating upstairs and a recently added dart machine for a fun competitive game with friends. And for spring and fall, there is outdoor seating as well (you will appreciate the air conditioning indoors during the Korean summer months!). Don't miss out on the monthly Trivia Night as well for a good time with co-workers or friends.

The food, with the recently expanded menu, is always great. Remember, the Cinder Bar is a bar, so the menu is very appropriate, but don't let that fool you in terms of quality and taste! My personal favorites are the colonel chicken sandwich and wings...which remind of wings from back in the US. The burger, fish sandwich, fish & chips and fries are also favorites and give a variety of choices. Cost is very reasonable and appropriate.

On to the beer....the Cinder Bar offers a dozen or so beers on tap and countless bottled beers. The tap selection is vast from Asia-Pac to Europe to US to local craft and includes many types (pilsner, stout, IPA, porter, wheat, etc.). The whiskey selection is also extensive with many of my favorite single malt Scotches!

And lastly, the services is always phenomenal, which is the main reason I return. Warren, the owner, and his staff are always welcoming to both regulars and first time visitors. He goes out of his way to introduce himself and get to know his patrons.

So if you've relocated to Songdo or happen to be passing through, I recommend an evening at the Cinder Bar.",1
793,"Extremely unimpressed with this.

The concept is great, really. Cooking your own food makes it fun and cuts costs for the restaurant, allowing the prices to be cheaper (in theory). However you would expect the quality of the food you are being served to be far better than what you actually get here. Korean BBQ is wayyyyy better than this. This place was hyped up to me by a couple of friends (whose opinions I will take very lightly in the future). Unfortunately, everything is too salty and lacking actual taste and flavor.

The sushi, likewise, was a major disappointment as well. I did not expect great sushi (it is a Korean restaurant after all) but it was far beyond sub-par. The makis were rolled very loosely, so everything would break about before you could stick the piece in your mouth. The only semi-acceptable roll were the plain avocado... but even then, the avocado tasted old and the seaweed had an odd flavor. Was it stale? We may never know.

The vegetables were probably the best part of the meal. You are better off going to Le Petit Tobeki (formerly known as 5000 ans) on Monkland... but even that has declined in quality.

If anyone knows a great Korean BBQ place, please enlighten me!",0
794,"This was an amazing reasturant if you are looking for good korean food I would highly recommend!.
The staff and service were perfect! Food was marinated extremely well. The grill on the BBq was replaced at the perfect timw to keep the food cooking the best it could!
Accompanying sides were included with extras also available.
Try it it speaks for it's self!",1
795,"The Cinder Bar is out of the main area of Songdo yet it is the best bar. The drinks are phenominal. I would reccomend the Gin and Tonic which is a killer. The prices are incredible compared to other bars in Korea. The best part is the incredible atmosphere. The music is great and the everyone is incredibly welcoming. Especially Warren the owner and bartender of this place.

PS Order the Cinderella. Its on the secret menu. I can garantee that you will love it.",1
796,"I almost don't want to write a review about this place, because I don't want to say anything bad.

First off, the staff is so so nice. I really enjoy them. 

The dining room is beautiful- I love the decor.

The food that I've tried just isn't that great. I've been 3 times, and only once was it good. But the staff is soooo incredibly nice, that I would consider going back to try some of the more adventurous dishes- and I would just stay away from the sushi. I just have so many other sushi places I enjoy more.",0
797,"I only liked 2 things from the menu ALOT when I first came, which was the rib steaks and chicke filet. They were incredibly flavorful and fully loaded with an awesome and tasty marination and sooo juicy  . Everything else was very bland. I didn't like any of the sushi specialties,  just the regular cucumber and avocado makis which were nice and refreshing. 

The second time i went, we felt everything was tasteless, and the avocado was a bit browned :(
My friend didn't like the saki, it was very vinagery. I haven't tried a saki I liked yet, so I wouldn't know.  And the side order of spicy mayo wasn't spicy at all, tasted like mayo with food coloring    :(

And the service was very poor in the begining at our 2nd time. I wasn't too happy about just arriving like 20 min before the lunch time they stated, and yet still get charged for dinner, which is the same thing but for 2x$. They should have written it at the right time. Also a waiter told us to pay right after we ordered our first round because he was ending his shift, so we had to split his tip with the next waiter, instead of paying a full tip each, which would have been double for us, my friend was upset about that. Near the end a really good worker began his shift, and he was taking our plates very fast, so my friend decided to give the tip to him.

She doesn't want to go back there. I was disapointed at what was awesome last time, tasted completely different this time.",0
798,Went there last night. Was not top... customer service was slow... had to ask twice for a green tea. They serve hot beverage in cold drink glasses. I find the grill little too small and we were 4. I went to the washroom and it was not clean. And it's too pricey.,0
799,"Outstanding ""hole in the wall"" bar with good food. Run by a Kiwi with a lot of local experience. Well priced food & beverages; happy hour from 6PM to 9PM. No pizza (reported incorrectly here) but wings, fries, shrimp, fish & chips, & a burger. Friendly staff. Well done & highly recommend!",1
800,"Do not recommend! we ordered a vegetarian Bibimbap. They gave us 1st time a Bibimbap with meat... so we told the waitress and she said "" sorry sorry"". 2 min after we got another Bibimbap expecting a vegetarian one this time. After 2 or 3 layers we realized there was meat again inside this one. So they probably used the 1st one to redo a vegetarian one... Very disappointed. Not recommend this place!",0
801,"Ate here before the theatre..a random week night in chilly Edinburgh at 6.00...no need to book, I thought. Well, as they had online booking decided I might as well and, although there was one free table, it looks like booking was a wise decision. It’s a small, cozy space with friendly staff who talked us through the menu as we had never eaten in a Korean restaurant before. Prawn starter was magnificent and easily enough for two, followed by the Korean BBQ, neatly fitted into the table top. A decent bottle of reasonably priced house wine...what’s not to like?",1
802,"Restaurant review:
Olive oil fried chicken sort of has a healthy ring to it doesn't it.... This review is mainly for the original fried chicken. i have read that a lot of the other friend chicken with sauce are quite soggy and not very good. Personally the original fried chicken is quite crispy and has a clean flavor to it based on the oil used for frying. This leans to a crisp fried chicken instead of the chunky hard fried chicken you get at other fried fast food restaurants. The only issue is that the fried chicken comes at a cost. it is unbelievably expensive and the chicken pieces are also quite small. With that, it is good for a 1 time experience, but I will take my fried chicken cravings elsewhere. 

Pros: olive oil to fry chicken, waffle fries

Cons: Very expensive, takes a while to prepare the chicken sometimes

Hidden deals:
None

803,"The night I chose to check out this place happened to be Warren's (the owner's) birthday, the entire bar was more than happy to help him celebrate. The people are extremely friendly, when I first arrived I assumed that everyone in the bar were old friends. I was traveling alone and it didn't take very long before a group invited me to hang out with them at their table. Turns out most people had just met that night everyone was just mingling. I definitely recommend stopping in at Cinder Bar.",1
804,"We booked this restaurant based on all the positive reviews, unfortunately we found nothing positive about the food! We ordered the Rib Eye steak and Salmon Teriyaki from the Grill section. As you don't get anything with either dish we both ordered a bowl of sticky rice each. The Steak was tiny, overcooked and fatty and the rice was just plain nothing to write home about. Although the salmon was a good size it just tasted burnt and was in a pool of soy sauce .Overall the food was very disappointing, the staff were not very helpful, it was a big disapointment after all the good reviews it got. We were both still hungry so had to get a burger from McDonalds before going to the theatre!",0
805,"Concept int챕ressant, l'ambiance est bonne et le prix raisonnable pour un all you can eat. Je recommande.",0
806,Wonderful authentic Kimchi and glass noodles and table BBQ is great fun if you don't mind smelling a bit smokey after. Decor and service are excellent but loos were a bit messy on my visit.,1
807,It was full with clients that's why we got in. We asked about lots of optional drinks and snacks trying not to eat anything unusual.,1
808,"i used to go to the one in downtown and this time i thought i will give their yonge location a try!!

ordered the chicken dakgalbee with their original joons sauce. and always its a must to add on cheese, ramen and ricecake!!! (MY FAVVVV!!!) 

it was a little different as the dakgalbee was now cooked by a staff and brought to you instead of it being cooked right in front of you!! (there was a little area on one side of the restaurant where a staff is cooking all the dakgalbee orders). i didnt like that as i enjoyed taking part in the cooking process and watching it cooked right in front of me!!

the portions did seem smaller and the ramen ended up being overcooked. everything else was ok. maybe its just me but i find the downtown location tasted better!",0
809,We ate here after a long days walking which may influence my review to be fair. I found the menu limited and the place was so busy the staff don't have much time to explain the options or make recommendations. I found the side dishes the worst I had in Seoul and the chicken seemed poor quality to me and quite fatty.,0
810,"I've been passing by this restaurant for years and finely gave in and went with my
Friend.

At first we were seated on the side leading to the kitchen it looked dirty so we asked to be moved to better seat.

24.99 unlimited food sounds like the real deal and it is just depending on what you like. Personally the cooking part is cool but it does take work. The best meat was beef rib most flavour and best quality. Shrimp I found bland and no flavour, same
For the chicken and beef slices. I asked for some sort of sauce all they had was spicy stuff untill one of my orders came the fried dumplings. The plum sauce is what I was dipping most my food in because lack of taste.

It was a great experience but I don't think the food was that great. But a pitcher of Sapporo 16 bucks can't go wrong with that.",0
811,"I've come here many times over the last couple months. Their menu isn't extremely long compared to some other Korean restaurants, but everything I've tried so far has been delicious. 

They have some of the tastiest takoyaki I've tried in Montreal and their kimchi pancake is delicious. They are also one of the few places in Montreal that offer Cupbap. I got to try their friend chicken during my most recent visit and I really liked it; it was very juicy. Their fries are also a little sweet, if you're into that. I highly recommend this place for some down-to-earth Korean food. 

The only minus I've found so far is that they don't accept credit card, only cash and debit.",0
812,"Great Korean barbecue and good sushi. Come early it fills up quickly.
This is an all you can eat. You order dishes and cook them on the grill in the middle of the table. They also serve sushi though this is not the principle attraction. If you want just sushi you will be better served elsewhere. Ambiance is good, though loud.
Enjoy, I have several times.",0
813,"Very nice food, and great concept. Service could be a bit more attentive, but overall we had a great evening.",1
814,"Given the good reviews, we were looking forward to this for a pre-Hamilton meal, but we were disappointed. On a very hot night we tried to go for a ""light"" option of sharing several starters, but everything came deep fried, and not particularly tasty. Won't go again",0
815,"Ordered an Uber take away Chicken Bibimbap and kimchi! Delicious but.....no forks O.o Just imagine- you're hungry, you just got a warm meal but you cannot touch it!! Bit disappointing 🙄",0
816,"The first time I came here. Delicious food, kindness service and staff very friendly. The best Korean BBQ I was ate. Much better than almost Korean BBQ in London. Highly recommend for everyone love Korean BBQ.",1
817,"The taste of food is nice and the price is reasonable. However, the service not really nice. All the staff work like zombie. All the shop no one can speak either english or chinese. We want to change rice from normal rice to fried rice because we order wrongly, the guy staff said no no!! And left without help anything. Only a guy who wear shirt which I thought he's the manager help us change and cook for us.",0
818,"Me and my friends only tried the chicken fried rice but it was SO GOOD! In fact it was so good that we came back 5+ times for more on our trip to Korea. Last time we ate there we asked less spice and that was a mistake, since the spiciness really added to the taste of the food. Once one of the employee finished frying the rice he shaped it as a heart. Was super cute! Was very cheap too so it didn't kill our wallet :)",1
819,"If you ever find yourself in the Songdo area of Inchon, you must visit the Cinder bar. Warren, the owner, is very personable and welcoming to new guests. I don't regularly drink liquor (prefer beer), but Warren makes a G&T that could convert me. This place is a must if you look for a bar with a laid back atmosphere and good food.",1
820,"I had spicy chicken and my friend had soup that had shrimp, tofu and fish with the bone in. The soup was bland but the chicken was really good. The 6 sides were interesting none of them made be say oh wow though. The service was great and the atmosphere is typical of an Asian restaurant. Not sure I will visit again but it was a nice experience.",1
821,"Only few measure of a good Korean restaurant. Pork bone soup was undercooked. Tofu soup and expired ingredients. And nearly impossible unless under horrible conditions, the Kimchi was expired. The cucumber Kimchi was just a cucumber in water. The servers are all confused as hell. They brought out the mains before the Kimchi and the rice much afterwards.",0
822,"I have been going to this restaurant for lunch takeout on and off the past few months. I usually get the beef bulgogi or the beef galbi bento box and they are consistently good. It is very filling and comes with rice, kimchi, vegetables and a fried dumpling.",1
823,"Warren is lovely, and the atmosphere is perfect for post-school gatherings. The sliders are just the tastiest thing, both beef and fish. I especially enjoy the ginger-lemon-something yummy drink :)",1
824,"I ordered two pic for to go it took me 15mins stand
by and they just send my order. The chicken is not that good",0
825,"Busy, quirky little restaurant. Excellent value for money, fresh tasty food, cooking on the bbq, what’s not to love?",1
826,"The Cinder bar is full of character, just like its owner, who generates a fantastic atmosphere. Each drink is spectacular! *****",1
827,"It was my first time there. I was meeting friends, and i knew the menu wasn't really my thing. But, ok,,, usually most places have a decent salad.
It was Tuesday, noon.  At 12:15 we ordered lunch, Two people in my party ordered salmon, only to be told at 12:30 that they were out of salmon.
I ended up with a pricey burger, which was ok, but over cooked.  The service was mediocre at best.",0
828,It was my 1st time visit this place base on recommendations but I give 4 start because on busy fathers day weekend  I order a dessert after nice food very yummy and so flavorful but wait for over 20 minutes for dessert and to find out that they dont have a mango for my dessert oh no how Vietnamese cousine doesn't have MANGO,0
829,"- I've driven past this place a few times but was hesitant to stop in to give it a try. The outside looked a little run down so it seemed a bit sketchy to me. The inside could use a little renovating as well as putting the AC on. When we got inside it was quiet and lacked decor. The Korean food here is good, even tho the actual restaurant is deceiving. I must say the bibimbap is better than any other I have tried in the Charlotte area. The bulgogi on the other hand, was good, just average. 

One thing I would recommend is to not go on your lunch break. With only 1 person serving the whole place and what seems like only 1 person making the entrees in the back, you're time does get very tight unless you call ahead. 

Overall don't judge a book by its cover. What seems to be not appealing on the outside (& inside ) has pretty tasty food.",0
830,"The beef was good , didn't change out the grill as often as I am use to ..
Not a big selection on sides with grill.
Coming from BBQ in Los Angeles I have High expectations..
Good for first timer ...",0
831,"Delicious meal, best dish: marinated BBQ, great service, to give you an idea, some Korean friends recommended the place to me. Definitely will come back!",1
832,"I've eaten here a couple of times now, and both times were a pleasure. The food was excellent, and the staff were very helpful and welcoming. I'd highly recommend it, and I'll definitely be returning here in the future.",1
833,Authentic Korean barbecue is very good. Good variety and quality of foods. The restaurant is spacious but not too elegant.,1
834,"Although I love the concept, I was not thrilled with the food here. The best thing I would say is the chicken. It has a nice flavour to it. Other than that, I feel the food is quite bland. With no sauce or spice on the other meat, seafood and veggies, grilling just doesn't do enough. The pieces of salmon seemed fresh but when cooked just felt boring due to the fact they they were just simple raw pieces of salmon with no taste. I feel this place should offer sides of spices and special sauces to help compliment their meat. For me anyways, this would give a huge boost.",0
835,"After being recommended to go here by foreigners and Koreans alike I made the trip here (it's about an hour from where I live). Easy enough to find...keep the starbucks on your left and walk straight and pick up the sign!
I was instantly made welcome by Brandon the doorman who showed me in and sat me down at the bar. The owner Warren asked me what I was after drinkwise n made some excellent recommendations...all were consumed and were expertly made!
Warren has made an excellent atmosphere and the customers were all in on it. I arrived alone but left with the intention of going back and continuing to meet great people.

I can't recommend here enough...alone or in a group you will have a fun time. And check out the g n t's! From an English man, they hit the spot and more.

Thanks to all they guys at the cinder for a great time n I'll be seeing you again!",1
836,"My husband and I have been coming to E-jo whenever we are in town from LA. On our recent trip, we were disappointed with the service. The food is good! The Kimchi is the BEST! I too am a huge fan of their Kimchi and would buy their kimchi by the gallons.  However, with that said, if you want people to come back, then hospitable treatment go along way. 
Also being honest with prices would be good too! The menu had one price but was charged more, and wasn't even told. Unfortunately, my husband and I want to go elsewhere. We will sure miss the Kimchi!",0
837,"My husband and I came here for lunch. I had the hot stone bibimbap and he had the spicy pork bulgogi. My bibimbap came with soup which wasn't hot (I was cold so really would have liked some hot soup) and quite bland. The bibimbap was adequate, it is kind of hard to mess up bibimbap. The spicy pork wasn't at all like any bulgogi we have had anywhere. The flavor wasn't there and the sauce was pasty tasting. The meal came with two small dishes of kimchi and pickle none of the other accompanyments that I normally see. I have spent much time in South Korea and have visited many Korean restaurants and this just wasn't it. l always get worried when a menu tries to do too much. This place had everything from noodles to sushi.",1
838,"This location is horrible! One its winter and cold as heck inside with all the fans going full blast, two there's nothing like gangster rap music playing loud as hell, then to top it off almost all the food bins were empty. We ordered our water and lemonade and only waited 15 minutes for it and the place was 20% full. This is one location we will never come back to plus it was pretty dirty around food area. Not sure why we even stayed",0
839,"We all got excited about some good Korean barbecue and the menu looks great but our experience wasn't that great.
First the place is very crowded which by itself is not bad ( may indicate good food) , but after waiting a while the get seated, we found out that the Korean bear was not cold and there were couple of other options that we didn't look or. The appetizers were really small and the kimchi was not very pickled but rather mushy and not to much flavor. Also the barbecue was not crisp and not very well marinated. And to top everything we almost got embarrassed at the end when we were told that their card reader wasn't working and that we should go across the street to get some cash.",0
840,"The food was mostly good, portions are good most of the time but since is a buffet doesn't really matter for the most part. That being I don't think that it's worth it for the price, it's not the only Korean BBQ in town and the quality could be better. The service was not good. The waiter didn't come every time we ask something, and he seem like he didn't understand when we spoke. I think is important for waiters for speak French as well since I had to translate for my friends.",0
841,"The barbecue is decent, seafood is a little fishy tasting but the service is absolutely terrible. I would tell you to come here if you have enough patience FOR the waiters/waitresses. Some of them were in a terrible mood and made my dining experience terrible.",0
842,"I have never felt such an overwhelming urge to write a negative review for an establishment.

I walked in after a long day of work looking to order some takeout and enjoy it at home. After perusing the menu I decided to order an appetizer (vegetable dumplings) and a roll of sushi. I'm a tiny gal (4'11 and 96 lbs.) so this is more than enough to feed just myself. I had, however, been looking forward to trying the food here and had every intention of coming back and eating in another day when I had more of an appetite and could order a larger meal. Today I wanted to keep it simple. The owner, however, refused to even serve me unless I ordered an entree, which I simply wasn't interested in today. Not only that, but if I asked any questions about the items or dishes, not only did I not get much of a response, he just seemed irritated and responded in a very condescending manner.

I left absolutely disgusted with the way I was treated, and you can rest assured I will NEVER step foot in this restaurant again. I'm positive there are plenty of other restaurants in the area that would be happy to have my business and who are actually interested in having returning customers.

Good luck establishing any kind of clientele with this attitude.",0
843,"Korean restaurants seem to be popping up in a lot of places, so I wanted to give it a whirl.  My friend, Randy, and I saw this restaurant when we ate at a nearby restaurant a few weeks ago. We agreed to meet there for our monthly lunch gathering.  First impression was great.  The atmosphere is alluring, with an impressive array of visual stimuli.  Loved the red color scheme. It was quiet enough to enjoy a good conversation.   Unfortunately, the food was just not my favorite. The fried chicken strips were so chewy that I couldn't finish it. The kimichi cold slaw was good for the first few bites, but I couldn't finish it either.   The iced tea tasted like instant tea, not freshly brewed.   Finally, we noticed the Sanitation Score was a 90.5.  This is clearly below the standard that is acceptable to me.    I am glad that I experienced this restaurant, but I will not return, unless Randy insists, and I don't think he will.",0
844,"This place was recommended by a friend and I enjoyed it.  For someone to say they were disappointed at the fact that a restaurant called Mo Ramen had limited selection of food because it was only Ramen seems kind of well...ridiculous.  Walk into Mr Sub and complain about their lack of variety of food.  Give me a break.  This is on point with the Ramen house trend.  The specialize in Ramen.  So my experience here was good.  Servers were great, very nice and had no issue with English from what I remembered.  Place was clean and food seeemed fresh.  I have it a three star because it didn't blow me away but I'd go back again for sure.  Went with 4 adults and 4 young kids.  I am Korean and my wife is Chinese.  Hopefully they keep their standards up. 3.5 more like.",0
845,"Three adults introduced two kids, all of us non-Korean, to this cuisine...and it was a great experience! The service was superb, explaining any dish we weren't familiar with, and preparing the meat for us at the grill built into our table (which the kids loved). Apart from one appetizer that wasn't a big hit, all of the grilled meats and side dishes were excellent -- especially the Pork Bulgoi, which was labeled as spicy but was more of a pleasant tingle than really hot. Try this place if you like a Kobe-type Japanese restaurant -- much more flavorful cuisine here, and lower prices.",1
846,"So a co-worker invited me to lunch for my birthday. I went online, saw great reviews and the menu and decided I'd try the bimbimbap. the waiter however suggested that as a first timer I might want to try the lunch box. though both are crowd pleasers, I went with his suggestion and wasn't unhappy.
I got the bugogli (beef) lunch box. my co-worker got the chicken wing box, with a side of beef.

Unsure why my co-worker could get the chicken wing box with a side of beef, when I couldn't get the beef box, with a side of chicken... was the same food. but, what I got was really tasty and flavorful.
the beef could've been a bit more hot - semi-luke warm, but still not bad.

we got there when they opened at 11, and within 20minutes the place was nearly packed.

I wasn't too happy with the dumplings - they had somewhat of an odd after taste, but my co-worker says he liked them.",0
847,"I noticed with other reviews that getting a table for one could be a problem, but luckily for me it wasn't

The best is to compare this to any fast food restaurant. Don't expect a great service or a fine dining experience. But the food is good, fast and cheap!

After ordering your food and drink they soon come and prepare the food in a pan which is in front of you. When the food is done it's time to enjoy! The food itself has a great flavour and the portion is sufficient. If you are a big eater you might want to order a side dish.
If you need something you press the button and otherwise you go to the cashier to pay and leave.

A great place for a quick bite if you prefer to spent your time on other things in Seoul!",1
848,Overpriced! Atmosphere wasn't warm the service was not up to par the server was not knowledgeable about the food on the menu. Went to a place in Southern California food was great portions were great and less expensive than this place in Chandler Arizona and they didn't do a mandatory gratuity for four people how ridiculous!!! they jipped themselves I would have given more of a tip because that's the way I am not just 18% TIPPER! Won't try again....to bad.:-(,0

They show was amazing, I enjoyed it a lot, I was totally awed by the way they spun and twirled, and the many many instruments that could play! They don't allow you to take pictures inside, but they won't ask you to delete your photos either once you get your chance to. The food was okay, but just order a simple dish or something and just enjoy the show!",1
851,"Korea House is known for it's great service and quiet settings. You pay a premium for the location. And the restaurant is only made up of private rooms so I recommend reservations, but usually they can squeeze a party of four.

The side dishes are usually exquisite here, the beef is of the best quality. Though for basically the same quality you can literally walk about 100 meters to Saebyuk-jib and eat good meat. But you are paying a premium here for the privacy and small touches. For example the charcoal that they use is not preheated and they light in front of you since they are using a very good quality of charcoal.

Ask the waitress for the best cuts of meat that are available at the moment and they will recommend for you. As each day quality can vary.

They also have a dried fish (bori-geul-bi) with a green tea soup with rice to finish the meal. You take your hot rice and drop it in your cold green tea bowl. Take a piece of the dried fish that is broken up for you and dip it in the sauce they give and immediately eat the rice that was mixed with the green tea soup. It is fabulous.

I enjoy the dish so much that I visit the restaurant for the dried fish during lunch time and skip the BBQ.",1

Reply to Manager's Response.  Thanks for the polite response to our comment.  To be clear, we were well aware that yours was not a traditional Chinese restaurant, as evident by the tacos, chicken sandwich and burger selections offered on the small one-sided food menu.  Also, we were certainly not looking for enough food to serve an Army, but rather enough to satisfy the average appetite.  Only time will tell if your formula will be successful, and I hope you are because your bar area looked like a nice place to stop for drinks on our way to dinner.",0

I just came over from Canonsburg because of the high ratings in Yelp but found this little hole in the wall locked (with the sign out front still reading OPEN). It is 3:40pm on Monday afternoon so they should be open, but there are no signs of life. 
Very frustrated and hungry.......",0
858,"Been here once and never again...the grill...why do so many places use that stainless steel plate that just lets everything stick onto it and burn? In the end everything tasted BURNT and not very pleasant at all...I think the only plus side is it seems to be well ventilated? (actually i don't rmb too well but I wasn't overcome with smoke when i first stepped in, unlike some places I guess) Anyway I strongly recommend they change to some non stick grilling plates. Overall like every other ayce place...mediocre food for relatively reasonable price",0
859,"Not sure if this is a chain similar to the one on colonial but the decor and menu items were similar, except this restaurant is bigger with a higher ceiling. Their sides were just as flavorful, was not overwhelmingly spicy. Still a fan of their hot stone Bibimbap. The waitress recommended the ""Sundubu-Tzigae"" tofu and seafood soup, count me in as a new fan of this soup. The black goat soup is no longer in season :(

Aside from soy sauce, they have a red sauce available which compliments any hot dish.

The staff was very friendly and the restaurant itself is clean.

They do have table top hibachi available if you want to cook the BBQ meat yourself.

I wish it was in a more flattering location, I think it borderlines a hole in wall concept, but do not judge the interior based on the outside, my mother was a little turned off but I insisted. We both left happy with our food choices.",1

The kimchee is just how I like it and the Mondu is amazing!! Flavors are great, staff is friendly, and I love feeling like I'm back at my ex-mother-in-laws eating. They offer non-spicy meals too if that is not your thing. They have the best of all the Korean dishes, including the soups and the Korean BBQ. Whatever you're in the mood for, they got it, when it comes to Korean cuisine.",1

Free-flow kimchi is available, self-service. Restaurant is smoky during the grilling. Wear an apron to prevent stain on clothing. I covered my handbag & coat with the apron to prevent smokiness.",1
862,"Who can resist for mozarella?
This restaurant is very famous. If you go to Korea, you must it the chicken dakgalbi with mozarella. You can add ramen and topokki. Also you can add fried rice and mix with the leftover, then you get fried rice!
Taste really good and worth the price.",1
863,"I saw the restaurant had a big one step to get in, but inside it was pretty accessible. I was pushing my husband’s wheelchair in when the greeter didn’t let us in at all. He said we could not go in because it was too narrow. I went inside and I could see there was plenty of room to move around compared to most of the restaurants around Myeongdong. He said sorry, but didn’t let us in even tough there was room.",0
864,"The restaurant provides the food with direct cooking on the table in front of the guests which is quite interesting to watch. The taste is good and the portion is so big. We ordered only 2 portion for 3 persons, yet we felt so full.",1
865,The food is very tasty with generous portions. Seafood noodles recommended! Staff is friendly and professional. About 15 minutes walking from the Royal mile.,1
866,"Great bar; great selection of beers and drinks, fair price. the expats are extra friendly. Can´t wait to go back.",1
867,"The night I chose to check out this place happened to be Warren's (the owner's) birthday, the entire bar was more than happy to help him celebrate. The people are extremely friendly, when I first arrived I assumed that everyone in the bar were old friends. I was traveling alone and it didn't take very long before a group invited me to hang out with them at their table. Turns out most people had just met that night everyone was just mingling. I definitely recommend stopping in at Cinder Bar.",1
868,"Everything was super good, people of the restaurant is super kind. 100% recommended I'm happy of going that place.",1
869,"You people don't have a palate.  Regardless you are Korean or not, this cannot be one of those restaurants that you want to go for a decent food. If nice servers made you feel like you are eating a good food, You should go see a doctor.

From perspective of Korean, I should say something more harsh about the quality of food. However, I will try not to do so because it's ALREADY so bad. 

It simply reminds of my first cook which I made when I was 13!!!!!!!! It's that bad.",0
870,"Always got the Dak gal bee. Nice to have it once in a while.

My friend used to come here all the time but he said it's getting more expensive these days....",0
871,"Having lived in Korea (three years) and being married to a Korean, I think I know good Korean cuisine - and Korea House gets my vote for the best in Central Florida.",1
872,"I would not recommend anyone dining in, take out is okay. Just do not dine in, honestly never seen a server as obnoxious at the end where he basically called me back and was unhappy of the tip I left him, clearly his service is not worth 15% better be glad I even tipped at all, brought me water with oil like substance floating at the top and barely gave my table any attention. Food is above average I'd say, but service is just laughable. Will not recommend anyone to sit down and dine in, not worth the hassle of an angry man growling at you over tip.",0
873,This Korean restaurant is so good! The service is fast and friendly! The food is amazing! It's never too crowded either! If you love Korean food you need to come check this place out!!! Yum!!!,1
874,I tried to eat Korea food at Amazing Chicken It is very delicious and clean inside Absolutely I will visit again There is very nice place I recommend to visit there,1
875,A little slow on the cooking but worth waiting! Excellent korean authentic food experience will definitely be coming back for more,1
876,"I actually joined Yelp so I could write this review. The restaurant is visually beautiful. The quality of the sushi is above average. Pricing of food & alcohol is reasonable. BUT the service was so poor that  I will not return. More specifically, the all you can eat sushi is a SCAM. For the second time I noticed that orders are taken at the beginning of your one hour time limit, the quicker/cheaper items come somewhat quickly & the better rolls don't come until you have 5 minutes left - so you can't order again. I gave them the benefit of the doubt on my first visit but on the second visit it was blatant (there were only 2 other tables & a couple at the sushi bar the entire hour we were there). 
I'm not going to return for a 3rd trip to verify it again.
Long story short - don't offer all you can eat if you don't want to honor it or raise the prices & don't cut corners.",0
877,"i gave this place a try as the other Korean restaurant 'Toppokki' across the road in china town seemed too busy. The food was absolute garbage from the frozen breaded prawn starters to a kimchi stew which tasted hideous, I felt like i could taste tomato ketchup in the soup. The service was pretty appalling, had to go out of my way to get the attention of the waitress who was frowning the entire evening. No authenticity, horrible tasteless bland food which is nothing like Korean home cooked food, poor service. If only I could give zero ratings.",0
878,"Initially, we had some trouble finding the place. It's tucked around in back of the building, not in the front. We called and Warren's wife came around the block to meet us and lead the way! How's that for service???

Warren came over and welcomed us immediately upon arrival, making us feel right at home. He asked us about our normal drink preferences, then made some suggestions and headed off to get them.

We tried several different beers and of course, had some pub grub. The burgers and shrimp scampi are great!! Good portions and lots of options to wash it all down.

We met serval of the locals/regulars, who are all super friendly and fun to hang with.

All in all, a great time with great food!! Also, wonderful owners who truly enjoy taking care of their customers and doing everything they can to make your experience a great one!!",1
879,"Food and service was great, we missed Korea and were pleasantly surprised by how authentic was food. Everything delicious and portions were huge. Ordered stir fry squid, korean spicy cold noodle. Difficult to find - it's sort if behind construction site.",1
880,"Lime Orange is an excellent pre-theatre restaurant choice, very reasonably priced and beautiful tasting high quality food. Never having eaten Korean food before the staff we very helpful and informative advising on the best dishes to try. We had delicious Pa Jeon to start, followed by Beef Bibimbap and Pork Belly.

I cannot recommend this delightful family run restaurant highly enough.

I understand why Lime Orange don't take bookings between 18:00-19:30, so my tip is to get there early (17:30 latest) if you want to get a table and enjoy this delicious food without being too rushed. A queue developed at times, but was quite fast moving.",0
881,"Shit restaurant. Disgusting food. Bad waiters. 
This restaurant for pig not for human
I never had eat like bad food in Montreal. 
And also Very expensive (25 dollars for this...) 

If you want to have the worst moment in Montreal, go here !

From a French chef.",0
882,"The raw food were prepared great but with poor explanation and very poor service. 
We arrived at 10:30and been told we only can do last shot so why not we were fine and glad to obey the rule.
However they gave us the bill which we paid immediately before all food delivered except the deserts and ask for tips twice! How horrible someone kept asking for your money! I said I will leave it on the table.. And they just kept ask for that!!!! How creepy! 
I will not recommend to anyone who want to enjoy his/her dinner or lunch . 

FYI they served DIY BBQ so you have to cook it yourself I am fine with that cause I am from canton. But I felt confused the time I walked in . No one tell me what s going on there! I thought it s a full service restaurant.",0
883,"Dishes were dirty
Servers didn't care about our patronage
Honestly it's a discount version of Chakos with a heftier price",0
884,The food great!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE. Hubby went to get wings they gave us legs. We ordered calamari bc we were taking it home they gave us potstickers....I was so upset that I couldn't even go back to complain. This was the second not good experience with this company.,0
885,"I really wanted to love this place but I cant. YC's is a much better deal. 
Smaller portions, higher prices, drinks not included, no extras like soup and frozen yogurt and a server that you need to tip for not doing much of anything. Bleh

If I'm going to stand in line and create my own meal, let me wait for it and carry it to my table so I don't feel obligated to tip.

Nice selection of meats and noodles, sauces and spices - but I would never choose this place over YC's. Tried it 3 x's and just don't like it.
They do serve alcohol here so that is a plus.",0
886,"We went to Joons restaurant for lunch. Joons restaurant is a plainly decorated restaurant similar to other restaurants in the area. The restaurant was not very busy and the service was brisk.

We ordered the beef dumplings and Jjeesong bulgoli. The dumplings were okay, but not flavor to them. The bulgoli was difficult to eat because we did not know how to eat it. We did not know we have to cook it for 10 minutes on the gas stove on the table before eating it. Afterward it was pretty good.

Would we go back? Maybe if we were in the area.",0
887,"We had a very disappointing evening here. I have to follow a gluten-free diet and my friend stated in advance in her email booking that there would be two people who had to eat gluten free. The menu online also says that dietary requirements should be made clear to the waiters.

When we were ordering we asked the waiter which of the dishes could be made gluten free and which dishes should be avoided. The waiter did not know what gluten free meant and what wheat was when we tried to describe the dietary requirement. He made some suggestions from the banquet menu but could not confirm whether any of the sauces in the dishes contained gluten-ingredients which was very worrying.

We ended up having to order boiled rice and edamame means as we could not take the risk of having an allergic reaction. I would advise anyone with any dietary issues to avoid this restaurant as nobody seemed to follow through on the claim that they could accommodate dietary requirements.",1
888,"No matter what time I visit this restaurant it is always packed with customers. For Muslims, you can try their seafood fried rice and add few add ons such as rice cake, cheese, ramyeon etc. Good thing is that food is always served within 10 minutes or less.",1
889,"It was me and my partner's anniversary today and decided to come here for dinner. We had a reservation and they've seated us promptly upon arrival. The food was AMAZING! They did try and fill us up with rice overflowing from the bowls but it's all you can eat so what can you expect? The reason for the 3 stars is the service. Not that the service was bad...it was pretty non-existent after being seated. Our cups of water were not refilled unless we flagged down a server. When my partner was still working on his dish, a waiter came and asked us if we wanted the bill. With his mouth full, he nodded. The waiter brought the bill in a flash, and had him pay while he was still chewing his food! After this, our dishes were swept away quickly and rushed out. And no, we were not pushing the 90min seat rule by any stretch. We grabbed our things and made our way to the door. 
Really great food, but not in a hurry to go back.",0
890,The food was floating in oil. We thought the noodles with vegetables and beef were over cooked and also in too much oil.,0
891,"Had a lovely bowl of bibbimap, full of flavour. Excellent starters too. Quick efficient service. We did come out smelling of oil though! It lacks a bit of atmosphere, but I don't mind that - we only wanted a quick bowl of something - we weren't looking for a full on dining experience. Worth popping by if you're in the area.",1
892,Went here the other night for dinner. Luckily we booked a table before as its a busy and small place. The starters were phenomenal and we ordered two of the bbq meats to share along with the veggies. The food was amazing! Its a normal Korean bbq where you cook your own meat at the table but the staff gave great tips on the best way to do it. Great sauces and side dishes to go with the meat as well. The staff was very helpful and so friendly! Would go back every week if I lived in Edinburgh!,1
893,"Had the brisket, bulgogi and pork belly. Our favorite was the bulgogi and brisket. Make sure if you want the All You Can Eat you order off of that menu vs. the standard menu. Tables are tight with all of the sides but definitely yummy!",1
894,"Maru is the perfect place to take your borderline adventurous eater friends--you know those people who might be up for trying a different cuisine as long as it is delivered in a trendy setting. I love trendy settings, but I also love tasty food served in less than fashionable surroundings. If I had to choose, I would take food over fashion any day of the week and twice on Sunday.

I went to Maru for a loner lunch and ordered vegetable sundubu. The ingredients are fresh, and the banchan kept me happy. However, the sundubu was mild and, sadly, bland. I hate sad sundubu days.

From reading the other reviews, perhaps the real star at Maru is the BBQ or bibimbap. Maybe they are so excited about meat that they forget about the timid tofu. I give them an A+ for interior. 

Right after my meal, I thought I would be giving Maru 2-stars, and solely for sundbu it may be 2-stars, despite the super fresh ingredients. Now, I am giving them a little bump for maintaining a clean, attractive restaurant that can serve as a gateway for adventurous eats. And lovebirds be advised: These are definitely date-quality surroundings (as long as you don't get the kid playing cymbals on the grill cover as your dining neighbor).",0
895,"If you aren't from Korea, this place will make you feel at home. Even mix of westerners and locals. Great place to grab a beer with existing friends and a great place to make new friends. Hats off to Warren. Love your pub.",1
896,"The restaurant nestled in a great location in an area where it easily accessable by sidewalks. It's surrounded by other restaurants. On the Sunday I visited it was bare, a few patrons at the bar. After being sat and viewing the menu, I had sticker shock. I have a fast rule, if you visiting an international restaurant that serves another cultures food, the culture should be present in the restaurant. It wasn't. Moreover service was nice but a little in the really slow side. My Appetizer took 25 minutes to come to the table And immediately after my main serving was served. The place is a nice concept in a nice location but I think it's kind of gimmicky. Be ready for atomical pricing.",0
897,"Welcoming helpful staff, nice atmosphere. Starters of chicken katsu and veggie mari were good, as was yummy spinach side. Both had bibimbap for main which was delicious. Only quibble would be being served main courses half way through starters. Was told would stay hot, after stirring it was warm only as beef had gone cold. Would have preferred hot and not like I had to rush my starter as main was already there. Not great choice of puds but you'll be full by then anyway.",0
898,"Went here with 7 friends. Service was quick and efficient. We all went for the set BBQ menu and it was delicious. Side dishes were delivered but we weren’t sure what we were supposed to do with them until a pour waitress explained how it all was done. We all enjoyed barbecuing our own food at the table, and all agreed that we’d definitely go back again.",1
899,"I found this restaurant on tripadvisor as I was looking for a Korean restaurant in Muscat. My friends and I ( a group of 5 people) had dinner here on the 21st of January, 2016. It's in an alley across from chocolate room. There is a little area to park your car in front of the restaurant. It's open 7 days a week. It's closed from 3 pm to 4.30pm. The prices are reasonable and the food is to die for. I had dukbokki, kimchi Jeon, japchae, my husband had bulgogi and my friend had bibimbab. They were all delicious. It is a small restaurant but if you miss Korean food in Oman you can definitely have it here.",1
900,"A late night visit for a night cap found a great bar with friendly staff who very helpful mixed a great Moscow mule The owner at bar a great guy could not do more to make you welcome, will go again one day.",1
901,Authentic place to get good Korean food. My biggest complaint was the bright lighting. It should have been dimmer. Food was good and service was excellent. Cool building too.,1
902,"Sitting down and reading the rather high prices on the menu at this restaurant I figured I must be missing something. The large, unattractive, brightly lit room was full of customers. The service was sporadically slow and unfriendly. The food was nothing to write home about.
Which left me scratching my head, why were there some many people here?
And then it happened.
The lights were dimmed as images of serene forests and waterfalls looped on the flat screen TV. A piano accordion suddenly appeared and the waitresses began singing. There were fake bouquets of flowers, costumes resembling the ugly duckling after she grew into a beautiful swan, heart shaped maracas, mostly North Korean karaoke songs and a random version of 'On Top Of The World' by the Carpenters. The highlight was the waitresses rocking out on electric guitar, bass guitar and a drum solo.
Yes it was overpriced. Yes it was extremely weird. Yes I would never go back, but without a doubt, I will never forget it.",0
903,"From now on when I travel to Korea, I'll be visiting Cinder Bar! Warren the owner was so friendly and welcoming, and I certainly felt very comfortable socializing with all the great people who go there. Great food, great drinks and all round a fantastic night! If your in Korea, this is a must visit!",1
904,A hidden gem. Food and service were both great. It is a small restaurant and fills up fast so be sure to book. The kimchi pancake was excellent. Good quality meet and the banchan sides were also really good. I will return soon!,1
905,"I've come to this location several times. On one occasion over the summer, I ordered multiple dishes with a friend and we were not given any pickled appetizers. When I questioned the waiter about it, he claimed that the pickled appetizers only came with certain dishes. I thought that this was suspicious as everyone in the restaurant was receiving appetizers and there was no indication on the menu which ones came with them. 

So, I decided to follow up months later by telephone to verify whether the appetizers came with all dishes. The woman on the phone confirmed that they did. Yep, I was blatantly lied to.

Is this how you treat paying customers? By lying and disrespecting them?! Shame on you, Mon Ami. Shame on you. I'll make sure to spread the word about your unethical practices.",0
906,The ambience of the place is fairly traditional and be prepared to sit on thin cushions with your legs crossed and tugged under low tables. The food served are in small portions and you can expect up to 10 varieties of traditional food served one after another by girls clad in hangboks. You may not know what you have been served and the best thing to do is to ask the waitresses on what and how best to eat it. As expected the meals can be very pricey. I personally do not fancy such traditional food served in this manner.,0
907,"I just came back from my second trip to South Korea and have had Korean friends cook me yummy Korean food.
This place is legit.
Soups , Appetizers and main courses all are delicious.
You might find some small differences like beef in my soup was not thin strips but nonetheless very delicious with excellent flavor and plenty of herbs and mushrooms just like authentic soups I have had in Korea.
Rice was of good quality and cooked well.",1
908,"Warren welcomed all of us and made us enjoy our time at The Cinder Bar!!
The chicken wings were amazing, so we had to go back there again thea same night for more wings!!
Thank you for your hospitality and kindness!^^",1
909,It took 45 minutes for them to serve us. Never coming back. Food quality didn’t make up for the wait either.,0
910,"On June 5th, I ordered online and as my daughter was eating at there with her friends.  She picked up my order and  when she brought it home I could not tell the difference between my full meal and her leftovers! She had more leftovers than I had in a full meal! My full order was literally only 1 cup! It barely covered the bottom of the container! As I started to eat, I get a call from Genghis Grill. The person who I think name was.. Mike.. apologized and said my order got mixed up with somebody else's take home!  I could not believe it... I was eating from someone else's mouth!  He said he would check with his manager and make sure I got a refund, we it's been almost 3 weeks and I have not seen my refund... really!  Please help!",0
911,A great place where you'll find really good Korean dishes.. The BBQ is brilliant and the noodles as well. The restaurant is very nice and feels like you're at a house. Staff were very friendly :-),1
912,"Evening meal with a work colleague.

Very good food, and authentic Korean menu. The meal just felt a little rushed with starters brought out separately and mains before starters had been finished.

Would 100% eat here again.",1
913,"Beware of the seating arrangements. They will insist on sitting you in a particular area. We had a group of 5, and was separated to sit at 2 different tables, instead of sitting us at a table of 6, where there was no one sitting, nor was it reserved. 

Server also takes awhile to come back to you.",0
914,"It's a great bar, I like the atmosphere there and the staff is really nice. I've been enjoying every stay.",1
915,"I came here for dinner with a group of friends as an alternative to Korean BBQ. Of our group of 6, one ordered Bibimbap, 3 of us shared the Dak Gal Bee and 2 shared Bulgogi. I wouldn't recommend coming with a group larger than 8, as even with 6 of us it was a bit awkward.

The table-top cooking experience was interesting, but the staff are very unobtrusive when they come by to give the ingredients a quick stir and make sure everything is cooking along as it should. We just kept on with our conversation and soon everything was ready to be eaten!

4 of us (including me!) are self proclaimed wusses when it comes to spicy food, and the Joon's original sauce was ok for the 3 having the Dak Gal Bee, but too much for one of my friends having the Bulgogi. I think it has to do with how much sauce they add at the beginning because as it cooks and reduces the sauce gets spicier. I found the spiciness enjoyable because it added a kick but wasn't uncomfortable. If my taste buds needed a break I would take a bite of the mashed potato side dish (yummy!). 

After our Dak Gal Bee (chicken, veggies, with extras of rice sticks, sweet potato and seafood) was mostly done, our waitress added white rice and made a delicious fried rice dish on the wok using the remaining sauce. I think it was the best part of the meal!

Bibimbap tip: if you are not sure how spicy you like this dish, scoop out some of the hot sauce first. The put a lot in the dish and you are supposed to stir it all up before you eat, but my sister did that her first time and nearly died from spicy heat! It's much easier to add more than try to eat something that's burning your mouth. 

My friends who have been down to Joon's on Bloor St. said that the menu here is smaller, however this was a fun restaurant with friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere. I'm personally not the biggest fan of spicy food, but if you like spicy Korean food this is definitely a spot to check out.

They only accept Debit, no credit cards. Washroom is located downstairs. There is limited parking behind the restaurant.",0
916,Visited Taste of Korea for dinner this evening with my husband. It’s a little difficult to find but the food is worth the effort. It’s an easy 15 minute walk from The Chedi hotel. This was our first experience of Korean food but the menu was simple to follow & the waiter guided us with the amount of food to order. We went for one of the fried boneless chicken specials which was described as sweet & spicy. To accompany this we had the fried vegetable rice. We were also served a number of side dishes of various textures & tastes including miso soup. We really enjoyed our meal which was really tasty & really reasonably priced at 10 Rials. We would have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant to all.,1
917,There is only one anser ; The Cinder Bar why? Its a great place because warren and his team are very friendly the food is nice especialy the wings the beer is fresh and the cocktails are awesome!!!,1
918,"Mijin is so sweet and attentive! If you visit in the afternoon, make sure to check in at the Cinder and visit with the most outgoing Korean bartender you will ever meet!",1
919,"As the name suggests each table has an electric barbi on which you cook your selected meats.
Excellent variety and the food was well prepared and very fresh.
Great fun and the family enjoyed the whole experience.
Waiter was extremely helpful, friendly and attentive.
Price reasonable for what we got.
Will visit again. Booking almost essential.",1
920,"I’ve been to this place many times; alone and with family and friends. This time I ordered kimchi chigae. The soup didn’t have a single decent piece of pork it used to have. It was all bit and pieces. One of the side dish had mayo which I couldn’t eat. Common allergens (ie eggs, nuts) are specified on menu, which gimchi chigae has but not for the side dishes. I couldn’t change the dish. If this had been told to me prior, I would ask first whether I could change. If not, I’d order something else. I ended paying for something I couldn’t eat.
Also, I ended up with gimbap without tuna despite ordering tuna gimbap on my first takeaway with the restaurant. Money wasted there.
The taste of the food is still good but other aspects has dropped quite a lot. A bit here. A bit there. It’s big when they are all accumulated.",0
921,"We when there to dine as we thought it was a Halal Friendly DIners...checked out the place & to our surprise the place is not halal. They don't serve pork but then their chickens are non halal...the service was also bad. No one guide us to our table when we approached the counter. We sat there for almost 15 min before someone approached us & asked us the order. We asked the waiter whether the place is a halal friendly & they said NO so we left the place immediately. So, my advise to all our Muslim colleagues, stay away from the restaurant!",0
922,"Numero Uno Public Bar in Korea, especially, Mr Warren and his wife are very kindly and friendy ...this bar provides wide range of fresh beers and qualified coctails with very cheap price.

924,"A wonderful family meal for 4. We had the 'D-Set' meat selection from the menu which was certainly enough for 4 of us. The meat were all very tender and marinates were delicious. The side dishes were all superb too, salads, radish and I ordered extra kimchi which was delicious. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. The value for the quality that we received was very good indeed.",1
925,"Our first time here. Made me wonder if I’d ever had a Korean dish like this before. It is a simple restaurant. I told the waitress I wanted something with pork and she told me to get the bulgogi. My wife had the beef version.

Many cold side ms served with it along with lettuce to, we assumed, use for eating similar to a lettuce wrap except these were longer skinny romaine leaves (I think).

Food was very tasty.",0
926,My friends and I had a great night of food and drink at Korean BBQ edinburgh. Staff are lovely and friendly and the service was great. The prices were really good. We thought it was one of the best value nights out we have had. Can't wait to return.,1

928,"Went for dinner. This WAS our go-to Korean restaurant. We sat down and immediately noticed very LOUD rap music coming through the restaurant speakers. Young servers and several young people standing around kitchen doors. We asked if they would turn off the music, and they asked if we wanted to move to another table. So we moved to a table at another Korean restaurant. The owners shouldn't let the children run the restaurant!",0

Finally getting seated, I immediately wrote down what I wanted...and waited...and waited...everyone else was getting served. I didn't even receive my water while the table next by was already grilling their stuff. What terrible service!  I left after waiting a solid 15 minutes.  Went else where. Awful service. They didn't even apologize.",0

935,"Completely underwhelmed by the food here.  The meat is not marinated and lacks flavour.  Do not come here expecting to find true Korean BBQ.  

The food comes with sides of spices and sauces to put on the meat while it cooks but there is definitely a lack of quality to the meat that is served.  This place is passable considering how cheap it is.",0
936,"5 stars for the food. 0 for service.  We went on Tuesday night at 8 pm of last week. The place was quiet. Only one other table.  We ordered 4 appetizers and spicy chicken for main course. The appetizers came out quickly.  We almost finished our appetizers and a couple came in.  We waited about 30 minutes, still no chicken and our server was no where to be seen (there were 2 servers that night. One had only one table and ours had us and the new table).  Waited about 30 more minutes and our server came out with chicken but brought to the table that came after us.  They looked surprised but ate a piece of chicken each then pushed the rest aside.  I watched them since I had a feeling that they were our order. 

At this point, our drinks were still not filled once and we were wondering why after an hour, we still didn't get our chicken.  The server walked by so we flagged her to asked about our order.  She looked back to the other table and probably just realized that she had brought our food to the wrong table.  She said nothing then went to the computer probably to check the order then went into the kitchen.  After a few minutes, she told us unapologetically that it would be another 30 minutes because they ran out of chicken. Enough said. We canceled the order, paid for the appetizers and left. 

As a former server, I understand, mistakes happen.  But she had 2 tables the whole time. We didn't expect our server to be chatty but our drinks never got filled, she did not smile once and she never checked on our table the whole an hour+ that we were there.  Again, we liked the food and we would most likely go back but the service will need to be improved or we'll just order take out from now on.",0
937,"I was so eager to try this place because it looked so nice.  Once we arrived they seated us within 8 minutes.  Then we had to wait another 10 just to see someone and order a beverage.  She dropped off our beverage and did not inquire whether we wanted to order and disappeared for some time.  
Eventually we ordered and our food arrived rather slowly.  We watched others who arrived after us receive their food first.  Its a good thing we only had Pad Thai.  
We finished our mediocre meal before we saw the waitress again.  

Overall its over priced, service was slow and poor, very very loud in this place, very nice decor, seats were very hard and not comfortable & food was mediocre  and not very good. 
We will stick with Basil, Red Bowl and Thai Taste for our Asian food needs.",0
938,Excellent place for G&Ts which feels a bit like a bubble somewhere outside South Korea - this is probably why so many expats hang around here. The owner is a very friendly guy and admittedly one of the best gin and tonic gurus east of London...,1
939,"This place was quite the disappointment. I don't remember it being this bad 4 years ago. Or maybe I just forgot. 

Anyways, came here for dinner with a friend. She got bulgogi and I got the tofu stew. The bulgogi was quite tasteless with no spice at all. My tofu stew was a depressing site. You know those seafood medleys that come frozen at the grocery store? I think mine was made of that. There was one calamari ring, three mussels and one dried up shrimp. LOTS AND LOTS OF ONIONS. 

Oh and the side dishes?!? What on earth is happening. I've never seen side dishes so garbage before. Not to poop on a place but kimchi, radish, mashed potatoes and broccoli with hot sauce on top doesn't sound right. Where's the seaweed, beans and sprouts. 
I don't see myself returning here.",0
940,Went for one of those after midnight special with a few friends and we had terrible service. Waiters were rude and obviously didn't care about customer service. Would never come back or recommend this place.,0
941,"Good option of bar for the expat crowd. Nothing special, pleasing mostly foreigners. All kinds of drinks, expensive and very small place, but apparently the only option in town if you don't speak Korean.",1
942,"There are many of these chain restaurants in Seoul. The establishment is always busy because it has a fast service with reliable taste and affordable price. If you want to get traditional Chicken Galbi (유가네 닭갈비) in a local small friendly place with tasty side dishes and wanting to blend in to the local crowd, you would love this place. If you higher expectations there are better places that serve the same food for a higher price.
I would recommend it.",1
943,A little bar tucked under an apartment building run by super friendly kiwi Warren. Wazza and the crew go out of their way to look after you from remembering your drinks favourites to dishing up excellent bar food as well and even ringing around for other late night bars to find who was open when it was time to move on.,1
944,Service was horrible. Sat down for about 5 minutes and no one came to serve us. Asked 2 different waiters for waters and it literally took 10 minutes for WATER to come. Then it took 10-15 more minutes for food to come as if we weren't already starving. The food was also horrible. Sprouts weren't spicy. Kimchi also wasn't spicy. I understand they're busy but that's no way to treat customers. Definitely not coming back again.,0
945,"Traditional Korean restaurant with the food I grew up on. My favorite is the Oxtail soup #4 and my husband's is #1 (beef brisket). He says it reminds him of his Czech grandma's broth. Arrives bland but add salt and it becomes a very rich and flavorful soup. Dump in the rice, and it's the perfect comfort food. It's our go-to when we're sick or just craving a soul-warming meal. I personally haven't liked any of their noodles, however, but their soups are so good that I overlook it.",0
946,"If you aren't from Korea, this place will make you feel at home. Even mix of westerners and locals. Great place to grab a beer with existing friends and a great place to make new friends. Hats off to Warren. Love your pub.",1
947,"It is our first time for korean food in Edinburgh. I would say that I will absolutely come back again. All food is fresh and good quality.
Thanks for this lovely meal^^
See you next time!!",1
948,"Tucked in a corner of Chinatown, this little slice of Korea was almost empty when we arrived at 12:15. The waitress was swift to warn us that they were cash only but luckily there was a cash point in the Tesco express just up the road.

By 12:45, the place had filled with chatter; even the large banquet table down the middle was full. Reassuringly, the majority of diners were Korean and we were only 1 of two tables with Westerners on it. The menu was all in English and the waitresses were quick to take our orders and very helpful.

We ordered samgyupsal(belly pork) bbq, soy bean soup and kimchijeon (kimchi pancake). The kimchijeon came first, unusually it seemed to have been deep-fat fried and so had a slightly crisp coating but still tasted quite good. The soy bean soup was good though a little low on chillies. The samgyupsal was somewhat disappointing - rather than the thick meaty strips of the home country, this was more reminiscent of bacon; thin and overly fatty. Despite that, it was an enjoyable meal, coming to £32.00 for the three dishes plus sides and drinks. Is certainly go back to see how the other food compares!",1
949,"Ventured here with our Korean friend, who we promptly put in charge of ordering. The kimchi cut fresh at the table was the best that I have ever had - the radishes were especially delicious. 

Don't ask me the authentic names, I don't know them, but the pancake, beef with veggies, and the assorted beef soup were all incredible. I tried beef tongue and tendon for the first time, and thoroughly enjoyed both. The tendon is a bit gelatinous, and the tongue tastes just like any other cut of beef. We got two cold buckwheat noodle dishes, and I definitely prefered the broth preparation to the chili paste preparation. I WILL warn you however, that these noodles were EXTREMELY difficult to bite through. I took a big bite thinking that I could just bite them off, but I couldn't, and kind of wound up choking a little. The super kind server came rushing over to see if I was okay, or if the food was too spicy. And I was embarrassed. White chicks eating Korean food wrong. Boo. 

But it was no big deal, I took smaller bites and loved every minute. The staff is very friendly, and helpful if you aren't exactly sure what to get.",0
950,"A great place to meet up with friends! Thank you Warren for letting us barbecue and celebrate my last day in Song Do! I will never forget your hospitality and the bar's wonderful atmosphere :) Also, those fries are amazing!!",1
951,My husband and I came at teatime before the theatre. Staff were friendly enough and the chef very helpful in helping my husband with the BBQ. All meals were very tasty. It all felt very authentic. Would try again.,1
952,"I could've given a 5 starts but the customer service was horrible. I was trying to be nice and even tried to make jokes to lighten up the mood, but he didn't want nothing from that. I understand that we need to pay 15% but the way our waiter spoke to us was disrespectful. Our waiter yesterday night was not listening to us and took really long to bring our ice cream at the end of the night. 
There are ways to explain the rules of the restaurant to customers in a respectful way. I really didn't want to give the tip but we had no choice apparently.",0
953,"£75 for two people was a bit pricey for a light lunch, food good but not stunning. Pancakes a bit soggy and oily. Sake was the cheapest and a bit like fire water but I still drank it. Pick carefully and you will have a great meal.",0
954,"1 star is an overstatement. On my list of worst Chinese food I have ever had. I had sesame chicken and ate 1 bite and spit it out. Probably going to have upset stomach now.

I actually love Chinese food hole in the wall joints, but good gosh $22 for sesame chicken dinner and side lo mein and chicken is not even edible WTF!!!",0
955,"The dak gal bee is quite good.  Not a place to go for fancy decor or attentive service, but good if you want to grab a quick bite of authentic Korean food (if you've been to Korea:  it's like any of the millions of low-end diners around, which isn't a bad thing).",0
956,"I have been to several North Korean restaurants in several cities, they are pretty similar in many ways. Nothing special if you have been to a North Korean restaurant, but if you are familiar with the Korean food often seen in South Korea, some dishes with the same names are worth tasting. North Koreans make kimchi with a different way, very unique. Not the best place if you expect a conversation with your friends, because their music is loud and are the reason a lot of people going there for, and who knows what the waitresses would do when they hear what you are talking about, they all speak Khmer, English and apparently Korean very well.",1
957,"It's been forever since my last Korean BBQ meal. Never been in Montreal for AYCE BBQ; I was pretty skeptical when I looked at the menu beforehand. Sushi at a Korean place? Never a good sign. Turns out the owners are Chinese so don't come here expecting the real deal. 

That being said, we were a group of four on a Thursday evening. Can't believe how busy it was. There was already a line at 6:30pm. One family I saw (also a party of four) didn't get sat for at least an hour. Yikes. Reserve (only can on weekdays). They almost messed up our reservation (took my friend's name down completely wrong) but everything was good in the end. 

There's three different menu prices. It depends on the time that you come and if it's weekday vs. weekend. 

- Lunch: Monday to Thursday (11:30am to 3:00pm): $15.99 vs. Friday to Sunday (12:00pm to 3:00pm): $16.99
- Dinner: Monday to Thursday (3:00pm to 10:30pm): $24.99 vs. Friday to Sunday: $26.99
- Late dinner: Friday to Saturday (11:00pm to 2:30am): $14.99

We tried most of the things on the dinner menu except for the fillers (aka. rice, deep fried and sushi). 
- Good: seaweed salad, kimchi radish, tofu skin sushi, sliced beef, short rib, ox tongue, salmon, clams (its spelt calms on the menu), corn, pineapple (wish they sliced these flat instead of bite sized) and fried scallop. 
- Decent: kimchi, salmon sushi (this is nigiri: okay but rice is bland), spicy salmon roll, spicy sausage, onion, zucchini and mushroom. 
- Bad: edamame (dry), green beans (frozen and tasteless) and all the desserts (vanilla, mango, green tea and strawberry yoghurt ice cream were generic and pretty unsatisfactory). Also tried the lychee jello (tastes like those lychee suction cup candies) and mango pudding (good but too sweet). Desserts were disappointing. 

Food was decent but service was pretty brutal. It was painful trying to flag down our waiter to get him to change our BBQ. We'd flag down other waiters and they'd say no problem but no one would come back. 

Can't say I'd return anytime soon. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere; so many amazing restaurants in this 'hood.",0
958,"Very good expat pub with a very friendly staff. They will get to know you and if you come back after being gone for months you will be greater by name.
Typical pub food that is pretty good.",1
959,"What a great experience! We love going to NYC to get authentic Korean food cooked tabletop but now we can have it close to home too! The meat was very fresh and flavorful, the sides were great and the kimchi pancake was everything I hoped it would be!!",1
960,"As other reviews have said, the waiting service is poor. This is mainly down to the poor attitude of the waitress with glasses. There were several scenarios where arguments nearly broke out. The food is average and I've had better in London. They do not have space for you to put buggies and it ends up near the door. I did't feel comfortable with this.",0
961,"This is unfortunate.  I have been to some of the other chain restaurants and they were wonderful.  This was our second time.  The first experience wasn't nearly as bad or we wouldn't have come back but now it's time to warn others.  1st this is not cheap.  The small bowl is $12.49, reg 14.49 and large $15.99.  To put that in perspective, my husband and I typically share meals.  Here, he gets regular and I get small.  The wait staff is attentive and friendly enough.  You may wait a little, but nothing terrible.  The buffet bar itself has food everywhere.  Several items that are dropped in the containers of food.  Which is understandable.  But there is no one maintaining it.  There are several men at the grill and the area is filthy.  One guy was pouring a bucket of dirty dishes into another bucket on the floor.  A couple fell out.  One of the cooks stepped away from cooking.  With his gloved hand, picked the bowl up off the floor, tossed it in the bucket that is on the floor and then stepped back to cooking.  It was mentioned to the guy who asked us for sides and he did ask him to change his gloves.  Trying to eat lighter I got the chicken.  It was so spongy (assume fillers) and had so much fat and connective tissue still attached, I couldn't eat it.",0
962,"Got in, request for assistance for a seat with backing for toddler, got rejected. It’s a eat or get out mentality here. Pure disappointment",0

Soju puts a twist to tradition Korean food dining with the design of the restaurant and the presentation of the food. The restaurant looks very much like a cafe with the art, the hanging lights, and the wooden tables; quite aesthetic. The food menu was very limited in comparison to a standard Korean restaurant. However, the drinks menu was more extensive. It was very nice of the owner/head-chef to greet us and thank us for coming out. Overall service was great and presentation was

Soju Punch: 
A mix between soju, yakuroto yogurt, and tropical fruits. This tasted really good! Taste like an alcoholic version of Yakult/Calpico.

Korean BBQ Combination:
If you're like me and loves to try everything, get this! You get all the three meats they offer: Kalbi, bulging, and dwaejibulgogi. It comes with white rice and two banchans, kimchi and pickled cucumbers. You get three decently sized pieces of each meat: The meats were cooked and seasoned well. The sauces were on the sweet side. I liked it, but for $18, I expected a bit more stuff. The banchan included pickled cucumbers and kimchi. The pickled cucumbe was sooo good, just the right amount of sourness and sweetness. The kimchi however, was more sour than spicy.

Kimchi fried rice with egg:
The egg was perfectly cooked over easy. The fried rice was seasoned well, but it was not that spicy. The kimchi was more sour than spicy. As someone who loves sour food, I still thought it was sour. Maybe it would've been more enjoyable if it was a bit more spicy and a bit less sour. 

VERDICT:

Would I order them again? I would order the drink and the meat again, but not the fried rice.

Would I go back again? If you want me to. I'd go if my friends want to go. But I would not be the one suggesting it.",0
964,"Haven't tried Korean food in a Korean restaurant before, and was thoroughly impressed.
We visited on a Saturday evening but however, I DID NOT reserve a table. So my advice would be to do so as it was busy. I managed to get a slot at 8 o'clock and eagerly returned.
The atmosphere was electric, the bbq's which acted as a lively centrepiece for each table, were producing an enticing aroma which elevated our appetite.
We ordered the sirloin to BBQ and the rice cakes. The sirloin was nicely marbled and marinated in a delicious sauce. It was served with lettuce leaves, kimchi, salad and bean sprouts. All were delectable.
The rice cakes were chewy and tasty. Perhaps a little too sweet for my liking as I prefer hot, spicy food but still so delicious.
We got octopus balls and dumplings for starters which were both so incredibly yummy.
Nothing was disappointing. I can't say a bad word. All customers were smiling and laughing. The staff were incredibly helpful and polite. The pricing was extremely fair.
An excellent meal and a great introduction to Korean cooking.",1
965,"Heard about this place quite a while ago and I've heard good reviews so decided to take a visit with the family. Not much of a big place and the food was okay. Quite overrated. Service took a while. Mains came before the starters? And even when we've finished our mains the starters still hasn't come out. They forgot our orders and the staff seemed disorientated. Some of the bbq meat were good and the rest were taste less. Seafood platter was okay. Fresh. The potato, pumpkin veg platter came out after we had the meat and seafood platter so we sat there eating grilled veg. The spicy fried chicken was really good and the decor of the restaurant is pretty but apart from that it was mediocre.",1

G Mart Korean restaurant is much better as far as taste and you get bigger portions. This will do when I can't make it to the other side,0

969,"I went here with my friend during the winter for Korean BBQ, true to its name.

The beef BBQ I ordered was way too salty and the some was the meat was not marinated. The amount of meat was too little in comparison to its price and other Korean restruants in the city.

The waiters were not friendly and when the chef came out to greet us, he was really...odd and we felt really uncomfortable due to his attitude towards us.

Don't think we want to come back here again.",0

The squid rings were grossly flavourless.
The beef was basically falling apart.

I missed coming here & then remember why I didn't come anymore.

This is not korean food guys. A lot of thing are missing for it to be a korean retaurent. It is basically a grill your meat and veggies. And it is overpriced for the meal you eat. They dont even use the same type of meat korean bbq use.(where is the samgyupsal abd the chadolbaeki?_aka the basics).... but at least they use fresh ingredients (sometimes). The owner is chinese so theres a lot of chinese influences that i spotted.. like the dressings and sauces and marinades do not taste korean (salty and spicy) but sweet and sour like chinese food. Or maybe americanized korean food? Idk ... i hope this is not what non korean people think this is korean food.",0
972,The dish was very flavorful. After few rounds of it we felt quite yucky. Mayb becoz we didn't order the instant noodle or rice or cheese to mix together that's y the sauce was too rich in taste.,1

only down side i think is you stink a bit of bbq cos of other tables cooking, wouldnt recommend going to this place if heading out after.",1

When our server came, she took our drink orders (good looking drink menu by the way) but failed to explain the ordering process. When we asked how to order our food, she pointed to the line and explained that we fill a bowl ourselves with what we want in the stir fry, then circle what kind of rice we want on a little card. We walked over to the line and were handed a tray with a stainless steel bowl for the create your own stir fry. The tray felt sticky. Gross. The meat section was first, and there were pieces of raw chicken that people had dropped in a bunch of other containers. Then I witnessed the man in line in front of us use his fingers to push the ground meat off of the tongs and into his bowl before returning the tongs back to the tray of meat. No thank you. The carrots looked like they'd been sliced days ago, all soft looking. Ultimately I put my tray back and decided not to dine here. Will not return.",0

The interesting range of drinks available traverse the globe too, from serving Korea's Maxx, new Zealand beers and decent Scotch whiskey to Manhattans and Warrens' signature cocktails... and now you can enjoy tasty food there too. Would I recommend a visit? Definitely, from meeting people in the community and watching a rugby match to having a quiet drink, this bar has it all... and the playlist pleases too! Probably why it's been our local for over a year.",1

Rice was good. Miso soup was good. Fried pot stickers were good.
Pan-chan - kimchi was good. Thinly sliced vinegar radish were good. Other stuff were not.

We ordered a mixed meat plate which came with two beers for £42 and we ordered rice and kimchi as well. The food was plentiful and offered a good mix. The lettuce, sauces and sides were topped up for free. The service was excellent with frequent grill changes and the food compared favourably to bbq I have eaten in South Korea. My partner very much enjoyed his first Korean bbq and would come again. I was initially a bit apprehensive as it was empty (at 5pm) and doesn't have a great exterior but I am glad we came in. Highly recommended, I just wish we'd had space for the kimchi pancake!",1
982,"The food quality is always hot and cold at this location. Sometimes its great, sometimes not so much, I wish they could be a little more consistent with the way they marinate their meats. Also, another issue I have with the location is the staff. No matter when we go, for some reason we always tend to have bad service. At first we thought it was because they were busy, but when we started to look around and observe what was going on, my bf and I realize that the servers at this location cater to their Asian customers before anyone else... Which came as a big surprise, shouldn't people be served in order that they arrive? Until they can learn to serve people equally, I will be ditching this chain completely.",0
983,"My husband and I have eaten at Korea House on occassson for several years and always enjoyed it but on our visit today, I was greatly disappointed. It looked like the decor had changed so perhaps it is under new management but they had better review their changes or I'm pretty sure the will go out of business. My favorite dish is Bulgogi ( a korean BBQ beef). This restaurant used to have wonderful slices of this marinated beef. The dinner I got today arrived in a ""bento box"" which is a novel way to serve Asian food, however, the meat that came in the box was like leftover scraps. It was about four tablespoons of beef shreds, the biggest was about the size of a dime. The was about half a cup of rice, a teaspoonful of green vegetable and about a tablespoon of Kimchi. I had ordered a combo with dumplings ( gyoza) and there were four of those without the unique dipping sauce that usually accompanies it. $2.00 worth of food costed $10.50. I left there very diappointed and hungry! Sad to say, I will not be back!",0
984,"We decided to try this place for lunch on a quick trip to Birmingham. There were four of us. Our waitress was very helpful, explaining and recommending dishes. We had a selection of appetisers, some meat that we bbq'd in the pit on the table, a broth dish and teriyaki salmon. I have no idea how authentic it is but it was all delicious. The gyoza were better than wagamama. The other dishes were interesting and made a change from Chinese/Japanese/Thai. There was plenty of food but not too much. It came to £61 which I thought was good value, we only had soft drinks. Only point to improve was that the ladies loo could have been a bit cleaner.",1
985,"I have been here three times. This is not really a Korean type. Fare to say it's Asian BBQ. For lunch, the choices of meat are only 4 plus fish. I like beef rib and fish fillet the best. They offer many other dishes like fires and fried rice. I always have pork potato soup and Korean cold noodle. The quality of meat is average but worth the money 15.99$. Plus 10% off for students. 
The place is always half empty. This time with road construction right outside and wide open door, the noise level is very high.  
The service was unsatisfactory. I came late at 2 pm. The only waitress already sat in the restaurant and have her big lunch with three other tables dinning and other people coming in. I understand you open at 11 am and you need to have lunch. A quick bite is understandable, sitting among customers, and keep eating for one hour is not very convenient to me. I had to stand up and approach to her to add orders and remind her of our orders, and I felt bad to interrupt her great lunch. 
At last the waitress charged us with tips included bill. Hate to say this but it's typical in cheap Chinese restaurants. Like I couldn't do the math or you are confident your service wouldn't get any appreciation.",0

988,"Dak Gal Bee. Dak Gal Bee. Dak Gal Bee.

That's what you get here. Chicken (and seafood optional) and vegetables, with cheese, ramen, and rice cakes added on. I come here too often for this dish although with all the add-ons, it gets pretty pricey.

If you want your usual gamjatang or soon tofu or kalbi beef, don't come here for it, they are best for dak gal bee!

Original spicy or extra spicy are good options. Gave the teriyaki sauce a try once and never doing that again.

They do need better ventilation.. way too hot for hot foods.",0
989,"Had the combination chicken (half is sweet, other half is soy) together go great; it is big enough to share. We also ordered some fried rice which was really nice too.",1
990,"My first Korean bbq restaurant I've ever been to! They had something for each of my picky friends - which is always a bonus! The menu is huge and has many great options to choose from. Everything we ordered tasted delicious. However the service was awful. We had to flag down our waiter each time we wanted to place a new ticket, and even had to remind her for a water refill. The food came out all in various waves. Sometimes items we ordered would never reach our table and items we definitely didn't order would come out. This place deserves 5/5 stars, but I sadly, can't give it close because of the service. Still a definite must try while in Montreal! $27 dollars for all you can eat ...so go hungry!!",0
991,Staff are so rude!!! They shouted at us and insisted to order one per person even though we have 2 kids with us. We weren't able to finish our food! Food is not good at all! I don't recommend this place!!!,0
992,"i would have never thought that this place could reserve such a surprise!
we had the buffet (6€). we didn't eat meat but the rest was more than enough! there is a selection of korean pickles (kimchi, cucumber pickles, carrots, beets, delicious stuffed peppers and others) you can tell that they are homemade. kimtchi was not particulary strong flavoured, as i like it, but my companion preferred it like this.
the lady prepared for us freshly deep fried vegetables puffs, banana and fish fillets. I was really surprised, the fish was actually really tasty and fresh, perfectly well cooked, juicy and delicious! even the rest rest was not greasy at all.

there were a few other dishes that I haven't tried, from what i could see it was noodles in different sauces with veggies and meat. there was a hot and sour meat soup as well, and rice of course!

I was so happy of changing my mind about this little family-run restaurant. the owners really care about what they are doing, and even though they don't have many clients, whenever someone arrives they treat him like a real host at their place.

the furnishings is really heavy and peculiar, but in its own way it gives a feeling of authenticity (though not Korean! elvis was printed all over on the seats :) ). the owners seem to be there out of any pretention, if not to do the best they can to prepare good food.

i left this little place with a smile and bitterness too,for having prejudged koreas Haus as just another fake orientalish imbiss for so long before TRYING IT!

well at least it has been a good lesson for me! and maybe for you as well!",1

995,We were two couples looking for Korean food and this was a recommendation of a friend. The Bibimbap with Korean beef and an egg is delicious and the dumplings are awesome as well! The owner himself serves and his wife cooks. The owner is extremely nice. The place looks very uninteresting from the outside and inside it is a collection of random stuff from all over the world. This place is worth a try!,1
996,"Love to try out local ethnic cuisine- good Korean. Speaking of locals, there were quite a few locals there. If you go after 6, plan on a wait. Service not bad for a Korean restaurant (though I realize I'm making generalizations). Slightly different concept- you pay extra for the ban chan (side dishes) and even white rice. Minimal cost though. Very limited ban chan too, but a nice change if you've been eating a lot of British food.",0
997,"I went 3 times, 1st time was good, the grill n everything awsm. 2nd n 3rd times weren't. ...friendly. waiters were unpleasant. They don't smile, not attentive. Don't like to have any conversation. Orders took long to serve. I don't enjoy food if it's not served with care n love. I complined, it seems to be a normal thing for them. 

Wat I didn't like about the place : not spacious, not well ventilated , not many tables with windos.suffocating, narrow between tables, so noisy. Expensive. Not Cleane. 

I love the grill do it ur selves. Many items to choose from . 
I will not go back ,didn't feel welcomed,wish the staffs were more friendly, little bit more spacious ,if were not too noisy,well ventilated,",0

1008,"The worst experience I have ever had in a Korean restaurant!

I am an Asian myself and have been in South Korea. I can say that I have had amazing Korean food everywhere in the world, but for sure NOT in this Korea Haus!

I went there with my friends and wanted to try out this Korea Haus, since our favorite Korean restaurant just moved to Charlottenburg. The food was disappointing and the price was way too high according to the size and the taste of the food. The four of us ordered four dishes, including two portions of Bulgogi, one fish soup and one noodle dish. The bulgogi cost 15€ per person, and the two portions we had were not even enough for one person to get full. There was barely anything in the fish soup, maybe four tiny pieces of fish?! The noodles were kinda OK, but did not have much flavor.

Two small side dishes came with the food. Since the four of us shared the side dish, we asked for another portion of kimchi. The waiter was nice enough to tell us that we have to pay for extra kimchi. We were surprised to hear that because ALL the normal Korean restaurants offer side dishes for free, as a custom. The waiter went to ask the owner if we could get one for free. The owner came out from the back with such an arrogant attitude and told us we cannot get one for free. He said, if we want to have free side dishes, we should go to another place. We were totally shocked and could not believe it. The owner obviously only wants money and does not care if any customers come back again or not.

Furthermore, I, for the first time, had diarrhea after having Korean food.

As a foodie, I will never go back to this place again and would also advise all Korean food lovers to avoid this place. You deserve better food and treatment for your money!",0
1009,Ate here last night for the second time in as many months and this time went for the barbecue at the table and loved the whole experience. The food was gorgeous and the staff were helpful and pleasant! Can't recommend this place highly enough especially if you haven't eaten this way before!!!,1
1010,"We tried Chicken galbi with cheese for 3 person, Fried Rice for 2 person. The cheeseeee is soooo overflowing, even we can eat the cheese for snack haha!! Love the place, staff really help us to cook the food and tell us where should get the side dish.",1
1011,"great songs, nice mood, good people.. especially the boss warren and friendly staffs!!!
i like cocktail 'moscow mule' and draft beer '420' in this bar.
and the shot 'oh yeah' (warren's specialty) is awesome
the bar opens until 8am!!! for customers who want to stay up all night lol",1

1013,"Great looking place, but that was about it. Was thrilled to finally get some Korean close(r) than Charlotte or Columbia, but both dishes we tried were a let down. The Bibimbap was far from sizzling and when they supposedly re-made dish was brought out, it was just reheated.",0
1014,we found worm in miso soup Very worried about how clean the food is. I mean all the meat we had.. worms.. just disgusting to even think,0
1015,"A nice atmosphere and good to see a Korean BBQ in Edinburgh this concept has potential if the food improves. Food was edible and pleasant enough, but I feel the chicken dish I ordered was miss sold by the waitress, she warned me the dish I ordered was very spicy, however, it was actually tasteless and bland not a hint of flavour or spice in my opinion.
Also the side dishes weren't very authentic and options to buy more sides were very limited e.g the only noodle option is udon.
If you're looking for good Korean in Edinburgh I'd recommend sodaeng as the best. Hope Korean BBQ is able to improve on authentic Korean flavours as I liked the look and feel of this restaurant.",1
1016,"For my first visit, I went at lunch and did Bulgogi bowl.  Meat was missing seasoning for sure.  Overall an okay meal.  Service very good.  

Second visit, I got a spice soda, green curry mussels, and Tom Kha soup.  Maybe I had high expectations, but I was underwhelmed.  The spice soda was highlight!  I got the honey orange- fresh, delicious and made on site. Highly recommend.  The Green curry mussels were fine- not best I've had. I like a crisp crostini and preferably
grilled but it was more on the soft side here. I also had to request a bowl for shells and a cocktail fork.  Minor things but take it from being 4-5 stars.  I've eaten Tom Kha soup at Rai Lay in South End- flavor out of this world so I had that expectation of similar experience and was far from.  Bummer.

I think this is a good addition to Fort Mill overall.  Will I go if someone invites me?  Yes.  Will I recommend it as a place to go?  Not necessarily.",0
1017,Never tried Korean before so asked them to help me decide. They were more than accommodating and went out of there way to say how the food is traditionally eaten. Can't ask for more than that it was fantastic give it a try you won't be disappointed.,1
1018,"This place had a very decent meal, the staff was really friendly, and everything seemed very clean. The restaurant provided us with a good amount of side dishes. Vegetables and the food we're very fresh. I'll definitely come back.",1
1019,"I really like this location better than the other locations. There's always a table open for me and my friends and it's never too crowded or loud. During the lunch menu there isn't any beef short ribs which was kindof a let down because my friends and I really only like the sliced beef, short ribs and chicken. My advice is to just skip seafood all together, it's not worth the pain. In general seafood at kbbq is never that great and usually falls apart or doesn't taste that great so unless you're a big seafood lover you can do without it. As for side dishes, the kimchi is always on point and so are the radishes and sliced potatoes. Depending on what day during the week you go, sometimes you'll find the portions are a lot smaller than usual. The first time I went they had pretty big cuts of meat but the last time I went the cuts were very small and thin but that's not an issue since it's AYCE you can just order more. PSA if you're paying with debit they charge you like $2 more so if you're ballin on a budget bring some cash!! Definitely recommend this place if you want some good kbbq",0
1020,"This is a pretty new place. The dining environment is really nice. They also have a wet bar. The food is so so, very Americanized mixed Asian food. We tried six different dishes. The curry and short beef ribs are pretty good. The rice bowel and spicy kimchi tofu soup is not good. They are not even close to what Korean food like.

In general, 5 stars for environment and services. 2.5 stars for food taste.",0
1021,"The food is nice, there's no doubt I will always be a fan of their meat, but it is unfortunate to say that the service there is mediocre. 1) None of the staff speak french. 2) sometimes you have to wait firever after your first order and at the end there's missing pieces. The waiters just want you to leave, they have the worst service ever. I'm giving a 3/5 star for the food, but If I could rate the service, it will be a big zero out if 5.",0
1022,"Perfect Atmosphere, Food, and Exceptional Customer Service! Terrific bar menu, beer selection, cocktails etc. Great Place!",1

1024,"The good..
1) Beautiful place
2) Excellent service
3) Quality BBQ meat 

The bad...
1) Spoiled side dishes (KimChee & Spinach)
2) Fish cake was cold and disgusting.
3) Experienced diarrhea 10 minutes after finishing dinner.
4) Overpriced green tea ($5 for two servings)

First time we were here was about 2 years ago and the food was good. It appears this place has gone downhill due to the lack of customers and are compensating by cutting on their quality and raising their prices. What a shame.",0
1025,"Cinder Bar is a wonderfully bright and joyful bar in a trendy restaurant/business district of downtown Incheon. It has a cozy neighborhood bar feel and a very welcoming vibe. In addition to expertly-prepared cocktails, and wine and beer, they have a great bistro menu of largely western bar food. The host, Warren, was exceptionally friendly and gracious and is a consummate host. The clientele is very diverse and all seemed to be having a great time. Cinder Bar is a must-see for anyone visiting Incheon.",1
1026,"I tried this restaurant after reading the reviews on here, i was most disappointed, we were the 1st in the restaurant at approx 5:45pm but the service was appalling. We were not given any advice, explanations or recommendations about the dishes on the menu. We were served by 3 different people, with the main waitress not talking to us at all when the dishes were delivered or removed the plates. We asked for a glass of water to accompany the other drinks we ordered and was given warm tap water with no ice, we were not offered mineral water. We asked for the menu to order tea when we had finished eating we waited over 20 mins and order still not taken. Also waited a long time to pay the bill, so much so we only just made the start of the show we booked to see.",0
1027,Frankly I have not experienced shops can beat this in terms of service. Shopkeeper insisted we had to order one portion per person even though we told them we definitely could not finish and it would be a waste of food. Walked out as the attitude of the waiter was SO bad that we rather go somewhere else that shows even a tiny bit of respect to food.,1
1028,"Seen a lot of my friends post pictures of this place (very excitedly) on Facebook. Also been recommended to come, so I came with my parents.

I'm going to start with the upsides. The two main servers speak fluent English. Major plus. They have two free parking spaces in the back (which they let more than two cars park in...). Also a plus. Biggest plus of the night is that they did not spill stuff on my jacket (see my review on Oh Geul Boh Geul, which I would rather go to than here still...)!

The meh's: The food was pretty decent, but nothing to write home about. We ordered two portions of the dak gal bee with seafood ($11.75 or so per portion). Seafood is mussels, baby octopus and something else I can't remember. We then added noodles (ramen - $2) and at the end, fried rice ($2.50). I had heard that the portions here were small, but I was hoping for the best. I hoped that with the side dishes, there would be enough for the three of us. Turns out I was woefully mistaken. Should have figured that one out by the number of (not) doggy bags the other customers had. The portions were not tiny, but they were definitely not generous portions. There were only four side dishes (kimchi, sweet potato mash, seaweed salad, pickled carrots and radish), and each came in tiny portions. Most ice cream scoops I've had are bigger than that scoop of sweet potato mash. Thankfully, they did allow us a refill. I was super excited for the fried rice, because the menu says that at the end, they put the rice in for you, add sesame oil and seaweed, then mix it up with the remaining sauce and stuff at the bottom of your pan. As soon as I saw the pan (before they put the rice in), I knew this was going to be sad. There was very little sauce to begin with. I mean, it coated what was in the pan, but unless they added more sauce (which they probably did), there would not be enough for the rice. The rice was NOT worth it. Buy a bowl of steamed rice ($1.50) and mix it in yourself. It's cheaper and pretty much the same. I detected a hint of sesame, but I couldn't find any seaweed. The fried rice aside, for two portions of seafood dak gal bee, there was only 1 mussel. Does this mean that each portion only gets 1/2 a mussel? The logic there makes me sad.

The downsides: Menu is quite limited. I prefer restaurants where I can order a zillion different things to eat. Already mentioned the portions above. Will reiterate. At a lot of Korean restaurants where you do your own table top cooking, or share an entree, especially those that say they're for two people, there's usually a lot of food (like enough to feed 3 hungry people or 4 average/small eaters). This was enough for two. We were going to order a bibimbap, but when we placed the order, the server came back to us immediately and apologized that they were out of cooked rice for which to make our bibimbap. This was at 7:15pm. This has never happened to me before. An Asian restaurant running out of cooked rice... wow. They were making more, but we did not want to wait for it. My parents were satisfied (as in no longer hungry), but I was about 55-60% full. 

Total damage for the night: $30 and a bit after tax but before tip.

Will I come again? Probably not voluntarily.",0
1029,"The food is good but the service was bad. Probably I was speaking in Chinese with my kids, and the waitress gave a face.

And when a Japanese family walked in, The waitress was giving the best smile n greeting the other family.

This made me wonder why there is a diff in service.

Hence I will not be eating in such restaurant again.",0
1030,"As we saw a lot of local people queuing for this restaurant, we decided to go as well. You sit at an table with a stove, where the attentive and english speaking staff will cook your spicy chicken or seafood. For two people, I recommend to get the ""small/middle"" size and to add some rice/tteobokki/ramen. Add some extra cheese to combat the spiciness. Also ask for an apron, as the red oil may spatter onto your clothes.

We really enjoyed this franchise and went again at another location.",1
1031,"Main bar for foreigners, having fun and learning english! The stuff is amazing, always a warm welcome. You can spend the whole night without being dissapointed. A place for going every week at least twice",1
1032,"Great bbq here for a fair price, and plenty of it. It's a nice break from the typical pub food. Highly recommended!",1
1033,"First of all we didn’t even get to eat at their restaurant, thank god. I came in to their restaurant during lunch and ask this person at the casher if they can cater for 16 people and he said no. Then i ask if he can prepare a table for 4, since my son is craving for fried ramen, what happen next was he went straight to the door and ask me to leave. Then i ask him nicely how long do i have to wait? He said go and don’t wait with a rude voice witout looking at my face and there was no explanation even a simple appology. This restaurant is the worst i have ever encounter in terms of their service with their customer. The rudest restaurant in Seoul. I don’t recommend anyone to come to this place. It will definitely spoiled your trip.",1
1034,"We went to the restaurant during busy hour. The waiter who served us was pretty rude, and there were many limitations on what we can order, which is ridiculous. This problem is made worse as the food we ate was less than stellar. I strongly urge readers to avoid going here, as you would probably have a bad experience like us.",0
1035,It was full with clients that's why we got in. We asked about lots of optional drinks and snacks trying not to eat anything unusual.,1
1036,We had the mixed seafood and chicken kalbi and my kids really liked the food. We were 5 in the group and ordered some extra rice and mozarella cheese. It was super yummy and we were all satisfied. Will definitely recommend the place. Thumbs up!!!,1
1037,"I don't normally write reviews but it just has to be done. The lady who owns the restaurant needs to stop telling us when and how we put Siracha on our bibimbaps. How we should be doing with the food we are eating.

It has been occasions where she has purposely took hold of the siracha and has put it all over my sister's food to the point she found it too spicy. If she is reading it, YOU NEED TO KNOW WHEN TO LET PEOPLE DO WHAT THE HELL THEY LIKE WITH THE FOOD THEY ARE PAYING FOR. You may not like it but hell we are the ones paying to eat there.

I won't be going there because of another attempt of eating there, she has tried to smother my food with Siracha when I told her NO.

I do not recommend this place to people who just want to eat HOW they want.",0

1039,Good price for the lunch special and decent selection. I wish they had different dipping sauces.,0
1040,"The first time I went to Maru, I went with a large group as a guest of a family member of the owners.  So we got personal service and never ending Bulgogi and Sushi.  It was my first Korean BBQ experience and I was hooked! 
The salad is addicting and sushi is good (not huge like many places, but nice manageable pieces) and Bulgogi is heavenly.  The decor is so nice and you feel like you should be on The Strip and not in a business park. 

Since then I have been to Korean Gardens, but decided to give Maru a shot with my own wallet (Ok, my Boyfriends) because we didn't want to go down to China-Town.  I might say that Korean Garden might be a bit better, but I would never turn down a dinner at Maru. I prefer that Salad at Maru over KG! hah. 

We went on a Friday night and were suprised how few other patrons were there.  It made me kind of sad  :(   

It deserves a shot!",0
1041,"We had the Korean BBQ (menu D) for 2 people with 2 beers each and more than we could eat, all for under £50. The waiters were so friendly and helpful showing us how to use the BBQ and talking us through all the pickles and seasoning. The food was absolutely delicious and the Korean Beer was good too. At the end the staff called us a taxi - they couldn’t do enough to help. The only thing to note is that it was cash only so make sure you take enough cash with you but definitely go! Also it really would be hard for vegetarians.",1
1042,"Very disappointing. We ordered the other day from Skip the Dishes. We were very excited to try a new Korean place. We have our local favorite but decided to venture out. Portions and price are reasonable but taste is a whole other story. Three dishes - from most to least satisfying. Japchae - very tasty, the only tasty item. Tuna Kimbap - a little soggy, just didn't have the usual satisfying taste. Soon Tofu Jjigae - supposedly this has seafood - maybe 1 shrimp and 2-3 calamari rings. Taste, leaves something to be desired. Now, the Teokbbokki - JUST AWFUL. It was essentially drenched in black pepper and we couldn't even take a single bite. Recommend looking elsewhere if craving Korean. This place is likely to disappoint.",0
1043,"First of all, the service was slow to the extreme! It took us about 10 mins to finally get the server's attention that we're ready to order. We ordered DakGalBee hot pot as our base and we also ordered cheese, noodles, etc with it by adding a few dollars. 
The taste of the food is just okay, nothing special that makes me wanna return to the restaurant.
But if you walk further up North, there are even more better taste Korean restaurants.",0
1044,"1) lots of people seated = extremely slow service. It isn't bad, it is just slow. Once seated, wait 5-10 minutes for drinks order. Wait for drinks 5-10 minutes. Another 15-20 minutes wait for food order. Raw/BBQ yourself orders, will obviously get theirs quicker. Possibly another 25-30 minutes additional wait for the cooked food. We opted for all cooked, so first 2 people ate theirs whilst other 2 watched, once finished, still a wait before the other 2 people were even served.

2) food was tasty and portions we thought were good

3) cash only

4) there are separate booths and tables for 4, the row of tables down the centre all squeezed together, so you may be next to strangers. The seats are comfy and the atmosphere is lively, and you will likely be socialising with your own company anyway

5) you/your clothes/coats will come out smelling of BBQ/oil/grease/chilli etc. The vents up above in the ceiling might not be doing anything useful at all

Would recommend going if you have lots of time, want to try different flavours on your palate and/want a different experience of cooking whilst socialising and eating.

Next time we come, we'll choose our clothes wisely.",1
1045,"Before I start my review, a matter of full disclosure first: I am the contestant for this Genghis Grill's 2014 Health Kwest, a competition to lose weight over 60 days eating Genghis Grill once a day for each of those days. As part of this competition I do get a free bowl for those 60 days and must complete social media challenges for the possibility to win money at the end of the competition, one of the challenges is to complete a Yelp review. I will try to be as fair handed as possible.

This particular branch of Genghis Grill fell under new ownership a couple of months back and they have done wonderful work to update the look of the restaurant and up the skill of its employees, and it shows. The new bar and dining area are tasteful and the staff is excellent. 

Over the past 48 days, I have become acquainted with a number of the staff who know me by name and are always pleasant. Allen, Andrew, and Mike have always been skilled behind the bar and make sure my stays are pleasant and my glass of water is never empty. Arnell and the grill staff are always hard at work and always make sure my bowls are well taken care of and never burned or under-cooked. David, Martika, Hailey, and Edwin have been some of the best servers, making sure my bowls are brought to the table quickly and always greet myself and any guests with a smile and great attitude.

The food here is what you make of it, quite literally. There is a variety of meats from beef and chicken to turkey and calamari. With plenty of seasonings and loads of vegetables the real struggle is to limit yourself so your flavor combination doesn't overpower itself. This is one area of criticism. While some recipe cards are offered at the line, there could definitely be more, showing how versatile a Mongolian stir fry can be. Given the combinations, you aren't limited to just an Asian inspired meal. You can branch out to an Italian pasta dish with pepperoni and red sauce. You can do some outstanding fajitas or even a manly beef and vegetable with barbeque sauce dish. I just wish they had 1) a salad bar and 2) a buffalo sauce so you could make a buffalo chicken and vegetable dish.

My only criticisms are minor and I really enjoy the establishment. And don't let people tell you these places are grossly unhealthy, if you do your bowl right and pay attention, they can be extremely good for you. Even my vegetarian mom loves this place.",0
1046,"Walked in when they opened at 5pm. Place became busy after a few minutes. Uber driver guessed that we were going to a Korean restaurant as he said the street is a quiet street but he has dropped off a few passengers there so must be good he said.

If the closing hour is really 10:00pm they need to update their website!!! Either that or the waiters were in a rush and wanted to go home early.",0

1050,"Cinder is an excellent meeting point for International travellers and residents alike. The beers are carefully selected, the food is excellent and the owner is attentive and engages his customers in conversations. Well worth a visit or two!",1
1051,Satisfying meal good enough for everyone. We ordered the basic set chicken barbecue with fried rice for four (extra cheese) and extra noodle (for my wife who doesn’t want it that spicy). We were attended to immediately and the staff were going around to see to it that they would cook the food in front of you every time they would pass your table until it is done and ready to eat. I found the taste very nice and it does go well with their Korean cider (which actually is their local Sprite). Dinner turned out fine even if I did have some hesitation before we entered the place.,1
1052,"We've had dinner at this location a couple of times and nothing was really good, bland being the order of the day. The final straw was a take-out order of wings they were dry and hard. If they can't get even that much right .... let's say the only reason they're still open is the dearth of good Korean restaurants.

But there is a good one and not too far from here either, expect a long wait to get a table.

1053,"Was at Myeondong area with my family of four (2A/2C) shopping for hours that we accidentally bumped into this Chicken Galbi restaurant. The food (we ordered chicken + octopus + fried noodles) is simply delicious and would be easy to accept/eat, especially for foreigners who are exposed to Korean food for the 1st time. Price wise it is not too expensive, but would have to agree with many others that there is certainly room for improvement on their service level from the staff. But for the price one is paying and considering this is a so-called Korean Galbi chain, we are not too bothered with the so called poor level of service.",0
1054,"A friend and I had never eaten Korean before, and wandered into Miss Korea on the off chance we would enjoy it. The restaurant itself is not the poshest in the world, and if you're looking for intimacy then it's not really the place for you, but it is nicely decorated, the seats are comfortable and there's a friendly hubbub atmosphere. The waiting staff were friendly and accommodating, there was a wait for food but it was explained to us before we ordered so we didn't mind too much.
The food itself was tasty - we shared dumplings and edamame to start, then had black bean pork and noodles and bibimbap with a side of bean sprouts for main. It was tasty. With the exception of the bibimbap which came in it's own hot bowl, the food wasn't as hot as I would expect - but that's not to say it was unpleasant. (A lot of the menu is meat which you have to cook yourself on a built in grill on the table so I guess if you ordered that then your food would be super hot)
The reason the review is 4* and not 5* is that at the back of the restaurant there is some kind of function room or bar area, which generated a lot of loud noise throughout our dining experience, also, where we were sat was directly opposite the door and every time anyone went in or out the door stays open so we were repeatedly having to ask for the door to be closed as it was really cold. I understand the weather can't be helped and there are limited seats, we hadn't booked, so our table was probably one of the worst positions and if we had only had to ask once for the door to be closed I wouldn't mention it - it was the fact that even though the staff knew we were cold when the door was open and were stood and could clearly see (and feel) the door was open, they waited for us to ask before they closed it.
Overall though, a good experience.",1
1055,"Came to Miss Korea on the recommendation of a good friend who accompanied me. Nice modern decor without being ostentatious. My friend chose the menu and I was very pleased. The starters of chicken dumplings and fried vegetables were nice and the edamame fresh but it was when the table top cooker was opened up and I was presented with freshly lightly fried pork, squid, prawns, mussels and salmon I realised how good the cuisine was. All of this at a bargain price. I shall come back again",1
1056,"In Town for a conference and spent some time searching for a place to have a drink. Uncovered Cinders after a detailed search but surprised that they weren't top of the search.

Owner, Warren, an extremely friendly and welcoming host! A range of beers to cater for taste and an even better selection of spirits for even the most discerning palate.

I started with a malty indiga (American craft) served with some dubiously crunchy (typically Korean) nuts and graduated through Guinness and Stella Artois to an extremely reasonably priced local lager. Even a selection of Scottish beers and islay malt whiskeys for the more selective drinker.

Would highly recommend the venue to anyone!",1
1057,I really enjoyed the food and they have a good beer selection. It's a must visit if you're in Incheon.,1
1058,The chicken that  I had  was fried crispy with the soy garlic was very very good! Now the pork belly on the other hand was not good it looks good but it was not good I had way better.... my fiance had to Simon on a bed of salad they give you a whole lot of salad but she did love to Simon.. my baby she's very picky about her food she had a fried rice with calamari and shrimp and she ate it all and this was a big helping!,0
1059,"Korean Grill House is a good place for meat. 
Meat meat meat, lotsa meat. Meat is how I live, meat is how I roll, and this place is full. of. Meat. 
This location of Korean Grill house is in a small plaza off midland Ave, so it's fairly hard to park, which is a small downside. the inside of the restaurant houses a lot of people, and it's always packed, so you have to wait to get a seat. 
You have either the choice of an all-you-can-eat grill, or a lunch bento box (at lunch). Being a regular customer after church, I come here (it's in the area) and usually get the bento box, as I'm starving after service. It's a fairly stable meal choice, with the choices of several kinds of meat at about 8-12 dollars each, with rice, tofu, a bunch of Asian veggies, and of course MEATTTT MEATMEATMEATMEATTTTTTTTT!!!!! sorry. 
I find the beef is either very very very  good or satisfactory, and is a risky choice to make, depending on the chef that is cooking your food, which you have no control over. I usually order the chicken, which is seasoned and marinated to perfection, with a good portion given to you. However, I find you sometimes have too much rice, and end up being able to have one bite of rice and one bite of meat, or vice versa, and have to finish your meat with no rice to mellow out the rich taste (though too much meat is fine :D) I wouldn't recommend getting anything else as they don't season those enough in  my opinion. 
As for the all-you-can-eat grill, it's super cheap, at what I remember of something like 13 dollars for one adult? anyways they give you tons of options of MEATTTT including beef, chicken, salmon for one deal and I think if you add 2 dollars for everyone you get Lamb and shrimp, which you should do, I mean it's only 2 dollars...
You don't want to pass down the grilled beef, as it's in delicately sliced slices, marinated with a sharp eye for taste (or should I say a sharp tongue), and completely delicious. The grill all in all is great. 
The service is mediocre, which is the only reason I'm taking off a star, since sometimes your order gets mixed up and/or it takes a year to get to your table at lunch. 
All in all it's a great place to go if you want meat, but not a great place for vegetarians and vegans :D. If I ever feel the craving for tons of grilled meat, I'm coming here.",0
1060,"This places needs an updated review. Me and the hubs came in on a weekday around 7pm and I was honestly shocked to see that there wasn't a soul in the dining room. You would think service would be good but it actually wasn't! The service was mediocre and we didn't get any drink refills. We were there approx 45 mins to an hour and only one other table came in and sat down. That table actually left before us because our service was that slow. 

Not sure if I would ever come back and eat here. If anything, maybe a to go order.",0
1061,"Came in as 15pax and asked if they could accommodate. Said no and we ask if we could get separate tables by seating separately. One of the staff was very rude and started asking us to leave, stating that they don’t want to serve us. Food is mediocre just like any order ordinary dakgalbi, nothing great. Would not recommend anyone here due to the TERRIBLE service.",0
1062,"I don't know how this place is still open.
I've never been food poisoned from eating korean food. I've had bad food but to be sick for couple of days from drinking 5 scoops of the Galbitang soup is unbelieveable!!!
Even the kimchee was awful. I serously don't understand how Kimchee would be awful.
Everything tastes nothing like korean food, used ajinomoto/dashi for seasoning, spoiled & old/aged.
Hopeing this place will do well but instead of improving, everything dropped severely & way way over priced for the quality.",0
1063,"I came here for lunch on a Wednesday. I wanted to try Basil Thai or Bab Plus, but the lines were too long for my time constraints. So, I decided to try BBQ Premium Chicken. I was hoping it would be just like Jip Bap (on 6th street, just north of Green), and I was pretty disappointed. I ordered the cup with sweet and spicy chicken and rice for take-out, per the recommendation of the cashier. 

The rice to chicken ratio is off - way too much white rice left over with pretty much zero flavor. The chicken was crispy, but again, the flavor wasn't amazing. 

I'm just a white girl that doesn't know much about authentic Korean cuisine, but I've had MUCH BETTER on campus. Namely, Spoon House and Jip Bap. I would definitely recommend Jip Bap 100 times before recommending this place for a much more flavorful version of a similar dish. 

Wait wasn't too long, but the restaurant was nearly empty. Decor is nice.",0
1064,"I like the food there, come here on many occasions but last occasion I lost my appetite from seeing 2 bugs climbing on the wall so close to my face.  
Cleanliness not very good.",0
1065,"After sharing a room with several Korean ladies, my daughter has a love for Korean culture, especially the food!

We try and find a good Korean food when ever we travel together, and closer to home as often as we can. A weeks holiday and a rainy day was a good excuse to try out Miss Korea, a BBQ style place close to the cinema.

The decor is minimalistic, with stainless steel and chrome predominated. The food and staff were Korean (so my daughter said). Despite being a busy Sunday lunchtime we were seated quickly. The menus are in Korean and English, and coded (in case you don't want to try and pronounce the names) with colour pictures to give you an idea of what to expect.

A complementary small portion of spicy korean salad to start with was a good start.

We ordered KIMCHI CHIGAE and BULGOGI DOLSOT BIBIMBAB and both of those were excellent. My soup came bubbling hot, and was full of flavour and spicy. Rice was included. I would also recommend the jugs of fruit juice. The mango we had was great!

It was good food at a good price (under £30 for a meal with drinks and a starter). A chain worth supporting...",1
1066,"Excellent gin, kraken and cocktails. Good bar food too. I recommend the cinder shrimp. Wonderful company too. Warren and the team are great.",1
1067,"We went 10:00 am and there were no customers.
We went group of 7 people. Gave $15 tip.
There were no 'extra' service except keep pouring water.
Waitress asked for $10 more tip.
She said it's because it is a group customer. WTF.
I said isn't it up to the customer?
And she goes yeah but... please give us $10 more.
Very very unsatisfied. Will never come again.",0

 Generous portions,friendly counter guy.
Place probably would fail a health inspection thou.
Never going back!",0
1069,"Celebrating a friends birthday so a small group. Keen to try something new we went for a set menu consisting of starters and main followed by ice cream. Starters was soup followed by something similar to dim sum. This was lovely and there was plenty of it. Then came main course which consists of various meats, vegetables and sauces which you cook for yourself using the hot plate in the centre of the table - think fondue style. Bit of a novelty factor which soon wore off as I eat out for someone to cook for me! Good to try/experience but if I went again I'd get something else. All of the food was lovely though.",1
1070,"Passing by many times, tourist behavior - try if you have not tried.
Tables are one of the smallest compared other restarants, seats are very packed, legs would hit the table legs if two sit
together on the same side.
Good for someone who like to eat rice. The problem is that the order is counted by the numbers of persons. One and only one dish ordered- big wak rice.
The one we ordered is rice with cheese, pretty alright and cheap, about $6000 won a person.
Free vege, raw cabbage and cold
soup can eat all you can- i did not bordered.",0
1071,"Was taken for a mother's day meal. What a meal if was we waited at least after hour before being dealt with. Was told we would need to pay by cash despite seeing others pay with card. We ordered drinks before my daughter went to the cash point I waited and the staff served the other familes arounf us despite us being seated first, did not want to bring the drinks out until she was back it was across the road in view of the restaurant. The food it's self over cooked tough, under seasoned and plain tasting. Was not enjoyable at all. The service was appalling it was like we was a burden to them the it was a shambles out starters we were brought one starter out of 3 and it took another 25mins before it was received. We had our mains before our starter arrived. Ended up just paying for what was ordered and leaving. Still hungry, disappointed.",0
1072,"Irrespective of whether you are a local, an expat living in Korea or just passing through the area, you really should be visiting The Cinder Bar. Put simply, you won't find a warmer welcome, a nicer atmosphere or a more enjoyable environment to spend an evening in.
The thing that really stands out about the place is that the team there are clearly genuinely interested in you having a good time whilst you are there and go out of their way to show warmth and friendliness, irrespective of if you are a regular or a visitor from out of town.
Food is tasty, drinks are excellent, cocktails are made with care and attention to detail. Prices are extremely reasonable, too.
The really nice thing about the place is that the positivity is infectious! Not only are the staff incredibly friendly and helpful, but this rubs off on the clientele, too. It really does feel like a little community!
If you are looking to spend an enjoyable time in the area, this is the first place to visit.",1
1073,"This is where I always enjoy Korean food the most. Always been in the Tarvit street branch. I was never disappointed. Food quality is great. I tried bbq sets and bulgogi dishes so far. They were always really tasty. Last time I got beef bulgogi, seafood pancake (that I adore) and a soup. Everything was just great. Little space, so if you don't book sometimes it's a bit of a risk. But it's really easy to book online. The service was great, everyone always friendly and welcoming. really nice a cosy atmosphere. It's not the cheapest place to eat but the quality is outstanding that every single penny is worth it. I really look forward to try the new branch as well. This place never disappoint.",1
1074,"We were going to see Sleeping Beauty at The Hippodrome so wanted a quick but tasty pre theatre dinner. Spotted this on way into Arcadian car park and thought we would give if a go. Restaurant had plenty of Korean customers and we were the only Europeans but we were made to feel very welcome. Staff were very helpful and we had three starters and two mains including a deep fried tofu starter and a spicy pork stew with kimche the pickled cabbage that seems to be very important to their cuisine. We also had a glass of white wine and an iced lemon tea. The food was delicious Anf plentiful and the bill was £29! Sorry to see some people had a bad experience here, ours was fantastic and I can't wait to try it again.",1
1075,"These people treat me really well. I love the KimChi Pancakes. I get them mild , delicious! If you are not accustomed to Korean Food or do not like a lot of spice , just tell them and they will tone it down for you as they do for me ! I love the Barbecue Chicken Salad. Do not miss the Pearl barley Tea. It is different, but it is great. The people here work very hard to satisfy you. Some of the items on the menu are an adventure for some Americans so ask if Americans are going to like them. If you are looking for Adventure the food is very good. The Soups are particularly good . Spicy and full of vegetables and sea food. You can them to adjust the level of spice if the stock is not pre prepared. The Korean style Sushi is a little different than the Japanese but if you like Sushi, you will like simple honest Sushi here.",1
1076,"This restaurant is located in the centre of Myeong-Dong. In the evening the restaurant is crowded. The staff holds is not to say that unfriendly, rather in the distance. This can be understood, the number of visitors is very much. The main ""trick"" for tourists - the food is prepared in front of you. For Koreans it is quite trivial. ""Prepared"" is probably a strong word. Rather mixed and heated. This allows you to feel involved in the process. The food itself is ordinary, nothing supernatural. I'd define as Korean fastfood. So the prices are quite humane.",0
1077,"No typical Korean free appetizer to start, just a few pieces of Kim Chee, the oxtail is tasteless , the spicy pork like a Chinese fried dish.",0
1078,"Well where do i start.  The food is very good here but that is not the issue.  The issue is service, which has happened now multiple times.  

On my second visit here, i waited more than 10 minutes just to get acknowledged to order food.  Then they forgot to serve me food.  So for about 30 minutes flagged down a couple different waitress and said where is my order.  The response i got was thats its coming.  But looking around me, people who arrived after me are all getting their soup.  I cant even remember how many times i have said something but they dont care to actually care.  Finally after i saw a couple pay for their food as they were done eating as they came in at least 10 minutes after us, i said they came in after us and they are already done eating and now paying for the food.   The lady said that they forgot about our order.  WTF......  she said they will make it immediately. 


On my 3rd visit i had to wait over 20 minutes after i sat down just to order.  Mind you its not busy in there!  It was not even half full.  Then it takes forever to get food.  

Today takes the straw.  There was only 3 tables of customers.  NOT ONE OF THE 2 WAITRESSES CAME TO TAKE MY ORDER.   Both my wife and I tried flagging one down but they just go right into the back.  

After 23 minutes waiting, we got up and left.  I have never experienced this is ANY restaurant in my life.  STAY AWAY from this place.",0
1079,"Ari rang Korean BBQ is not unlike the others currently trending around the valley and beyond. I noticed one major difference: horrendous service.
When you enter, you can go to the sushi restaurant side or the BBQ side. I have only been to the BBQ side. It is well ventilated, which is nice. The walls are all decorated with people's sharpie phrases, signatures and drawings. Some are funny, some are philosophical, some are lame, and some just are.
The tables are clean, but the inside of the grill controls are yucky. Clean those bad boys! Speaking of the grills, it's like pulling teeth to get a grill change. That would mean that your server would have to visit you once and a while. With a 2 hour BBQ limit, I can see how they make money. If they only visit you once or twice in the two hours, you barely eat anything, and you have no waste, because you're still starving. No one asks about drinks. You get one little plastic water bottle that is mostly ice, and shot glasses to serve it. For a table of 5, this is unacceptable.
The meats were pretty good. There wasn't much in the way of seafood, and every time (we've been twice now) I have asked for the squid, they don't have it. The steamed egg is tasteless. The gyoza is greasy. The tempura veggies were uncooked. If you get a hot green tea, it is served in a molten lava temperature pot with no handle. Like I said, you never see your server. We received incorrect meats, incorrect portions, and no grill changes. 
This place is a hot mess. The 2 stars is for the smoke-free air, and good meats. Everything else about Ari Rang is a downer for me.",0
1080,From the moment we walked through the door of the Cinder Bar we were made to feel like Family. It was the most fun we've had at night here in Songdo - Icheon South Korea. The food is truely amazing. Oh and the beer was awesome of course. We will miss this amazing little bar and awesome atmosphere. Thanks so much for making us feel so welcome. People please go here for a pint or a some fish and chips try the wings or ask for the famous Ginn and tonic. You won't be disappointed I promise.,1
1081,We wanted to go somewhere different as a family for Father's Day lunch and a friend recommended here. I always read reviews beforehand and so we knew about the cash situation and that service tended to be slow. We got there when it opened at noon and so service was not at all slow. We were the only customers for a while. It gave us time to ask lots of questions about the food and the numerous options. Two of us chose the cook yourself BBQ option and two had terryaki dishes. The beef terryaki was delicious and it was a novelty to cook on the grill. The rest of the food was good verging on ok. We didn't appreciate the additional 'tax' added onto the bill but had been very happy with our young waitress and the service she provided. Probably won't rush back but wouldn't rule it out either,0
1082,"I can honestly say this is the best Korean food I have had in Birmingham! However they need to sort out there air system as you stink of food when you leave! GET an extraction system in place!

Also been here a few months ago and still the credit card issue remains... They keep saying the system doesn't work... Seems to me they don't want to pay the card machine fees?! It's 2015 people get a grip!!!!

Other than this I still love this place! The food is excellent and the service is friendly! This is my third time back!",1
1083,"Food is generally good. Worth mentioning are kImchi which is mild spicy version, chewy tasty stirred fried beef & excellent scallop; & not forgetting the spicy taufu soup. The waitresses dressed in Korean traditional dresses will go up the stage for musical performance around 8 pm, which is kinda interesting.",1
1084,"As someone said, for Prague, where the food is quite mediocre, this place gets a four, while in LA it will probably get a three...
The fact that the owners are Korean does not make the place Korean. The food was OK, warm and generous, but it was not Bibimbap Korean.....
We ate, the service was ok, place looked OK, clean, though you step out smelling like the cook :-((
As I said, being that you are in Prague, this place is a good place to eat",0
1085,"I don't get why some of this cluster of restaurants can be so empty on a Saturday night while others are brimmed. Anyway, this place is in the latter category and it's easy to see why. I've never been to Korea so I can't vouch for the authenticity, but it's well worth a visit. The staff are very helpful and happy to walk you around the dishes. This is quite useful as some of the dishes a either quite spicy or served raw. They're also happy to anglosise a dish for you too, if what they're serving is a bit weird for you. Every table is equipped with a barbecue grill too, and this looks fun. I'm not sure where some of the ""expensive"" reviews come from on TA. 34 quid for 2 people with sides, drinks and starters is pretty good (what do you want for your money??) and the service was excellent, especially for a busy Saturday night. Cash only!",1
1086,"Best burger in incheon. Great service. Great selection of beer and liquor. Caters to expat crowd, especially flight crew and overnighting flight crew. It’s worth the walk. Must go,",1
1087,"Cash only!

I got the Bibimbap traditional beef and I didn't really like it too much. It was cheap for $9.95 which already includes taxes. The rice was really dry. But I had bibimbap else where but I don't recall it being that dry. Also there is only one kind of sauce that goes with it and its the spicy sauce. I did go up and ask for a different sauce and the response was what sauce. I told the owner something non spicy and he repeated what sauce. Not sure if he just didn't understand what I was saying. 

This place is located in a run down food court. I probably won't go back again.",0
1088,"Most of the food was good chicken was brutal and service started strong but fizzled fast ,in my previous visits I would struggle to complain but not this time, hopefully just a fluke",0
1089,"Good was lovely. Drinks were served quickly. Food not so quickly. Waitress service wasn't the best, seemingly too rushed off their feet to be too friendly or offer any menu guidance etc. We have eaten korean bbq before but they should really assume that and should take the time to offer to assist new clientele. We ordered squid beef and spicy pork with sides for the bbq. Everything was lovely and fresh. Staff were attentive at keeping an eye on bbq temperature and replacing the grease proof paper laid over the bbq though. I would recommend but maybe not for ppl trying korean for the first time.",1
1090,"I have been eating at Korea house for years. It is small, unpretentious, and tucked away in a strip mall. They have redecorated recently, and I find the food is still great. I eat the Japanese food - this is, in my opinion, the best Udon Soup in town. Also great Gyoza. Couldn't tell you about the Korean food, but don't believe the bad reviews - it is a really great little place.",1
1091,"Definitely a must visit for AYCE Korean BBQ in Montreal. Tianxia has better quality and more variety of meat than other places like Seoul Chako. For example, I find that Seoul Chako sometimes over-marinate their meat. Tianxia also offers free soft drinks in its AYCE price. My only criticism is that the place is a bit small so it can't accommodate large groups, and for a fun activity like Korean BBQ (where you cook the meat yourself), you want to go in large groups.",0
1092,"Not authentic korean food. Seeing that its main focal point is korean cuisine. You would expect that they would use korean white sticky rice, but sadly they used jasmine rice. Also at first glace the name is very confusing. It looks like the korean word for side dish (banchan ). Our waiter was extremely slow. Overall our experience was very disappointing.",0
1093,"I'm unfortunately going to lower it to 2*.  Poor service... plus the wait staff can barely speak English so it's a guessing game sometimes.  I found the prices to be steep looking at the KBBQ menu...$91 /4ppl KBBQ? or $16 for seafood pancake?!  Dolsot Bibimbap was a small portion.   Sides were still ok though. Kalbi was ok too.  What irked me is when I asked for recommendations on the menu (asking what's popular for lunch), they directed me to the KBBQ... But no one in the restaurant (which was full of Koreans) were eating KBBQ...   :(    $70 for lunch, I'd rather go elsewhere.",0
1094,"My friends and I went there a while ago because I was recommended by a relative but we were very poorly treated by the servers and staffs. Despite the place not being busy, the servers didn't attend us when needed and they were gattered at the front desk chatting while we were raising our hand for service. It took an eternity for them to bring us water and the server in charge of our table looked quite annoyed at us and would not take our order for the sole reason that it was written on two pieces of paper instead of one. I personally wasn't willing to pay 15% of tips for that kind of poor service (which was asked for with tables holding more than 6 people). In the end, we decided to go eat at the Korean barbecue restaurant facing Seoul Chako.",0
1095,Visited today two hours before or reservation but the staff were happy to accommodate us. We had the beef bbq set meal and it was great. Staff and food were excellent. Can't fault it!,1
1096,"This restaurant is always busy whenever we pass by. We went to Myeongdong 3 consecutive days and we were amazed how they get lots of customers. The first time we tried around 11pm, we were told that they were closed already so we went back the ff day for lunch. Had a good chicken and seafood dish with cheese though they can still improve on their side dishes. Wait staff always check our food and they did it alternately very often.",1
1097,"Been wanting to try this place for a while now since my best friend loves the mixed food in a big pot concept (galbee?) here. My mom and I had to walk out because we found it very pricey for two people, so this time we enlisted one more person to go with us.

For starters, the minimum order is 2 and each option (chicken, chicken and seafood, pork and baby octopus or beef and baby octopus) ranges from $13.50-14.50ish. We got the beef with baby octopus which is the most expensive one, with the original joons spicy sauce. I should also mention that you can't mix and match which is a big let down. Each add on (e.g. we got ramen noodles, cheese, rice cakes) is 2.25 Each, more or less depending on what you get. 

Presentation is cool but honestly the taste was very underwhelming. The flavour was just very monotone, everything tasted the same and had a very strong old cabbage bitter flavour.

At the end with tax and tip I paid about $45.  You're paying a lot for very simple and cheap ingredients with your hard earned money. What I am trying to say is, you can make something similar for way cheaper and taste wayyy better.

I won't be coming back here again if I had the choice. Sorry Joons.

Food - 1.5/5
Atmosphere - 4/5

The food is cooked right in front of you (and for you), and it is very tasty. The spiciness is just right and it is a delicious meal that can be shared by the table!

Pro tip: the minimum order is two people portion and they open till 2am, perfect for a mid night snack!",1

1100,"I was surprised at how the inside looked compared to my expectations. It's really really nice. Nice bar. TV's on a few walls. And outside sitting. Started with the calamari which looked a lot like onion rings when placed on table. They were the most tender I've had and while I was disappointed that no sauces came with it they have a sauce built in. A little sweet. On to the chicken strips. Lunch menu gives you 8 nice size pieces of chicken and a side. I will say the chicken looked better then it tasted. The coating and the sauce had great taste and texture. But very over cooked and a little dried out. 
I will return but not for the strips.",0
1101,"We ate at this Korean BBQ Restaurant the other night with friends (You cook your own food if you pick a BBQ dish).
Service was very mixed, girl waitress was excellent, organised and efficient, but the other staff not quite so, some were just lazy. Asked to get table cleared after main course, as they left it on table for 20 mins, even though the restaurant was quieter. The youngest staff cleared 1/4 of table, after requested, then proceeded to stand around and do nothing for next 10 mins. Eventually got table cleared, including glasses with wine remaining in them, after requesting again. Awful attention to guests.
Food was a different case. BBQ chicken was a generous portion, BBQ Prawns not so, only 6 medium prawns for the money. Stir-Fry was generous portion and tasty.
Restaurant really has to sort out service, as we left thinking there are better Korean BBQ restaurants near-by, so why would we go here again.
Tip should be given in cash, if added to VISA, staff do not get it, owner told me which is fair enough. If cash they get it (Legal requirement in UK anyway).",1
1102,"Two meats, beautifully marinaded, one in beer, the other sweet. Great kimchi too. Service faultless as before. Unhurried Sat afternoon meal, with just enough to eat. If you're confused what to order, the staff give great advice. Fast becoming a favourite place to eat.",1
1103,"From the time you walk in the door you are treated like a regular or long lost friend. Good selection of beer and great tunes. You will not find a friendlier, harder working crew in any bar. Too many amazing staff to mention but shout out to Warren, Mikey, Mijin, Saleem, Amir, Asad for way too many good times in the Cinder.

1104,"This little restaurant is run by a family that lives in the same building as the restaurant. It is worth ordering one of the meals that is cooked at the table and shared among all. We went with 6 people and got a meal that was grilled at our table for us and served with numerous side dishes. We definitely did not go away hungry. The waitress explained every step she was doing, telling us how long it would be until she was back to stir, etc., so we knew it was not time to start eating the dish yet. When it was ready, she demonstrated how to wrap it in lettuce for eating, and handed her demo to me, the oldest woman in the group.",1
1105,"The place is rundown and shabby. The lady is nice but the food is quite poor. I had the oxknee soup, spicy pork, hangover soup and handmade noodles. The oxknee soup was so bland. Adding chili didnt help. The hangover soup tasted like yuckt simmering vegetables. The noodles were bland too. The spicy pork was okay but not oustanding. It was abit too oily. I like their kimchi though. All in all, not recommended.",0
1106,"Came to dinner here. My sister decided to get the shrimp fried rice and not go with all you can eat like the rest of us.
Halfway through her meal she discovered a partially-alive fruit fly in her rice.
We called the server who called another guy and he asked if she wanted another dish of rice. NOPE One fly is enough. 
When the bill came we still got charged and it hard to argue with the guy in charge because of his broken English. 

Conclusion: If a bug is found in your meal be prepared to still pay for it because you ate some of it.

Is there any way I can give any less than 1 star?",0
1107,"We went here for lunch just a few minutes after it opened at 12 so we were the first in. Friendly welcome, quick service, tasty Korean food. Worth a visit.",1
1108,"Noticed this place few months back and after a friend recommended it I decided to try it last week. Called them and got the map on whatsapp.

Ambience is minimal, we were the only diners on a weekday at 8:30PM.
Ordered a chicken salad which was nice and a kimchi fried rice which comes with a lot more side dishes like pickles, etc.
We also got a soup (Radish) with it.
We didnt like the fried rice as we found it bland. Might give the other apetizers a try next time.",1
1109,"When I want to eat spicy Stir-fried Chicken, I usually went Yoogane. Yoogane has many kinds of menu and we can choose that we want to eat. When I went to Yoogane, I almost eat Yoogane’s spicy Stir-fried Chicken. It was my best menu in Yoogane. Sometimes, I add noodles and cheese. I think cheese is the best combination with spicy Stir-fried Chicken. Lastly, when I am done eating, we can add fried rice. I think this steps are best step for eating spicy Stir-fried Chicken. Therefore, if you have some chance for try it, you can order this menu. In addition, price is not really expensive.",1
1110,"We used to come here all the time several years ago when it used to be Takamatsu but have heard so many terrible things about Arirang about people getting food poisoning, the food being made with expired and low quality ingredients, so we avoided going. Recently, I heard that they changed cooks so my family and I decided to come try their dinner. First of all, their restaurant says it's a sushi bar, but they don't have sushi. Their side dishes looked dull in color and not very appetizing. We ordered mool neng myun which is a icy cold beef broth with noodles and that was lacking so much flavor. Even putting in vinegar, sesame oil, hot mustard, it was still really bland not very good. We also ordered bibim neng myun which is a spicy mixed noodle dish but the sauce was so bland, even when we asked for more sauce to put on the noodles, the flavor didn't change because the sauce was watered down so much. They also use super thin noodles that didn't hold up very well and it just wasn't good as much as we wanted to like it. The galbi seemed ok, my brother ate all of his order. The spicy pork bulgogi didn't taste very good either. The d챕cor inside is really weird, they use garden fencing as d챕cor. The music went from Korean hip hop to acoustic Justin Beiber and it was just weird. Overall, the experience and food was very lacking and we won't be going back. There are way better Korean restaurants nearby that have good food and better atmosphere.",0
1111,"Before leaving NZ to live in Songdo, South Korea, I checked out the important things to me squash, golf and a good bar. Squash is virtually non existent, golf is too expensive, but the Cinder Bar , oh the Cinder Bar. From the first moment I entered the doors of this small bar, I realised it had a huge heart. The guy who runs it tirelessly is Warren, a guy who remembers everyone’s names. The beer selection is amazing ... 12 on tap and at least 12 different bottled ales. The food is simple , but wholesome and tasty. Do not visit Songdo, without checking the Cinder Bar out.",1
1112,"This has been a good place for tasty food and I have visited it on a number of occasions in the past. However, of late there is something wrong with their ventilation, which really affects the dining experience and what comes after it.

After a busy week I thought I'd take the evening off and eat out to save time and work, but ended up having to throw all of my clothes, including my coat and my backpack, into the wash. I left the restaurant smelling very strongly of food due to the lack of air circulation and extraction. Also, the floor tiles were so slippery that I nearly fell over, which says something as I was wearing sensible shoes with non-slip Vibram soles. Other customers were similarly shuffling and sliding along in their sneakers to avoid slipping.

Overall good food, but not a relaxing experience and it created far more work than if I had stayed at home and cooked for myself.",1
1113,"That is the best experience I have had in any other bars I have been in. The bartender, Warren and his lovely assistants are the best persons to interact with in a bar. Not only did they teach me how to speak to korean people, and what to take care at during my trip to Korea, but actually they made sure we got home after a few drinks by ordering us the taxis.",1
1114,"I really wanted to adore this place since I had been eyeing it for a while and a friend had hyped it up, so I stopped by on my birthday. First of all, the seating is extremely cramped. The entry way itself, you have to push past lines of people to get out which, after trying the food, I couldn't really fathom why. We really wanted to try the dakgalbi, their speciality, but we were told we couldn't get that unless we ordered TWO of those. Ridiculous! After waiting in line so long and to be forced in to trying to get two huge portions simply for two people is crazy. Maybe the line up was because they try to enforce this rule and so people come in big groups which I think is absolutely silly. We were already here and waited so long that we didn't want to leave. Seeing what little options we had other than the dakgalbi should have been our next clue to leave. 

In the end, we opted for a ramen and a soup - both of which were doused in spice, and extremely watered down. Don't get me wrong, I'm South Asian so you know for a fact I'm not afraid of spices whatsoever but it was so much that all you could taste was the spice and nothing else. You literally could not taste anything else, no kimchi, none of the vegetables, not even salt. The ramen was a seafood ramen, but I got a total of one piece of (frozen, still cold) shrimp and two minuscule pieces of mussel. And that was just my ramen! My friend's soup was watered down, and again, all you could taste was tomato and the spiciness. Not even the rice it came with could make it better. 

The cheapness of the dishes should have been a reflection of the food and we should have stayed away, however it was because it was all so cheaply priced that we didn't feel that ripped off walking out of. The side dishes were also disappointing, specifically the sweet potato mash although it was nice to try a texture different than water. The cleaniless is also another topic on it's own. Flies were flying around and everytime I opened my mouth, I was afraid I would accidentally swallow one so I was consciously minding each bite which is a red flag of it's own. We didn't even finish, paid and simply left. All around disappointment. Stay far, far away especially in such an abundant place like North York where Korean places are a dime a dozen.",0
1115,"For a first timer trying korean cuisine, this is a great place to start. Especially loved the hotpot, bean sprouts, and fish cakes.",1
1116,If you're in the area - be sure to visit!! Warren is awesome. Always feels good to support a business where the owner sure cares about his work and the people who visit it (and their friends)! Thank you Warren!,1
1117,"We spend a few days in Birmingham, we drove for like 3 hrs n a half to arrived, then we straight went for miss Korea for dinner, it was good, love Korea food:) the kimchi pancake was good, as well as the soup with rice :)",1
1118,"It's a great bar, I like the atmosphere there and the staff is really nice. I've been enjoying every stay.",1
1119,"Used to eat at Joons years ago. Went by today at lunch to take a stroll down memory lane. BIG MISTAKE ! 

When we arrived at the restaurant it was only about 15% full. We ordered simple lunch meals. Then we waited... and waited... and waited. 30 minutes go by and no food came. Not even the side dishes. We stopped a server and asked him how much longer for our meals, and he said 5 to .. maybe 10 more minutes. That was it. We asked to cancel our order and left. No apologies from the server, just a weird look when we left.

If you can't put out food in 30 minutes, do not open for lunch. Lunch crowd be warned. STAY AWAY.",0
1120,"I'm not really sure if this is the 1st store, there's a few Yoogane in Myeongdong but this store is rather big.

We have 2 persons and ordered marinated
chicken galbi & assorted seafood with 1 fried rice. Should have ordered 2 fried rice.

At first, we don't know how to ordered, we were lucky that the young girl who served us could speak English and also she recommended us to take this marinated chicken galbi & assorted seafood because this serve 2-3 pax, other sets serve 1 pax and we have to order 2 servings.

The portion was not very huge, we can finished them. The marinated chicken was quite tasty, not greasy and very flavorful.

The staff look busy, those who cannot communicate with us, simply ignore us when we call for them.",1
1121,"It was my first meal in North Korean restaurant.
Comparing to similar Korea food restaurant, the interior is simpler and atmosphere is rather nothing special. However, the food was great.
I ordered ""So Yukgejang"", spicy beef soup with a bowl of rice and the taste was one of the best for such soups.
I was alone there for my lunch but was served by two beautiful ladies though out the meal and it was pleasant experienced to chat with various topics with North Koreans.
Highly recommended to try food there and have a chat with them.",1
1122,Go here to pick up food often. Very disappointed tonight.  I order crab rangoon and general tso chicken.  There was barely any sauce on it. Everything tasted greasy and like old oil. The rangoons should just be called cheese....there is literally no crab in them. The egg roll was weird and soggy inside.  I will prob not be eating here again. My leftovers are going in the trash.,0
1123,Really nice place and perfect to hang out with friends and have some fun 👌🏼😉 The beer is great and very interesting shots 😏😂,1
1124,"After trying to find a bar that suited our needs, we were directed to Cinder bar. We were welcomed by friendly staff and the host with the most Warren Kidd from NZ. Who welcomed us with a smile and stories to go with. We managed to watch the NRL grand final with all having a great time and bringing more friends. The chicken wings to die for and the mini sliders that helps the famished traveller. Beers on tap are, Stella Artois and max but never leave the place without trying the famous cinders flaming shot with Warren(host) explaining the process. Most westerners drink here. Bar staff are well mannered, trained and speak English. This cozy, warm, fun and cool place with a selection of music that will tickle your ears and suitable for all ages and its home away from home. Cinder bar can order your cab for you and Warren is happy to escort you and being fluent in Korean able to show off his skills with local knowledge conversing with the driver able to direct the driver to your final destination. I have attached two photos with address and direction from the business card. Smoking & Drinking is permitted outside but be aware of noise as neighbours are living near by. I have had many happy memories there and have met people from around the world there. It's not a nite club but more like a pub. Somewhere to relax, unwind, have a chat, catch up, and have a beer. I have given a 5 star rating for excellence in every aspect of service from the moment you walk in. It's so hard to leave. To Warren and Staff, thank you for everything on behalf of Rocket, Thor aka Thoro aka Tom. Signing off,

Jake",1
1125,"great songs, nice mood, good people.. especially the boss warren and friendly staffs!!!
i like cocktail 'moscow mule' and draft beer '420' in this bar.
and the shot 'oh yeah' (warren's specialty) is awesome
the bar opens until 8am!!! for customers who want to stay up all night lol",1
1126,"The food was slightly below average. The service is as bad as it can get. It's a wonder how they are still open but then again it's cash only.. so maybe someone is forgetting to declare their taxes.

Won't be returning.",0
1127,I had a little trouble finding the place but once I did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet. Amazing! The beer was ice cold and served in good portions. Beer price was a little steep for me but I hit happy hour just right so I got a bit of a break. Totally satisfied. Pro tip if you are trying to find it: if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it's on the left side of the street before the bridge. It's in a bit of an alcove in a housing development. Set back off the road a tad. There's a sign the points left and I made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road. Unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it. Obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it's the first set of building after the bridge on the right. The staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice. The fish and chips are phenomenal. Did I mention the fish and chips are great. You should definitely try the fish and chips.,1
1128,"We've passed by the place a couple times and were always curious about what goes on inside and what North Korean cuisine is about. When our friends came for a visit, we thought what better way to entertain them after reading the reviews online.

Food was really really delicious. The fried sesame leaves were a surprise. We love the topoki (rice cake), kimchi and especially this cold pork slices dish.

We were late for the show and yes, our waitress too left us midway service and hopped on the stage to perform. Show starts at 7:30pm every nite. It was a hoot just watching the whole fanfare but we had a tonne of fun. The only drag about the place was the chain smoking customers. Will we be back? Maybe when we have friends in town to entertain.",1

1131,"Coming from Asia and now living in Birmingham I enjoy eating Asia food. A friend advised me about this restaurant but I was sceptical about hi raving on it. Had an authentic Korean Barbeque best I have had in Europe totally love it.
Suggest f you want to go book or go early it is always full
Since I have been first time I have revised 2 more times and cannot recommend it more",0
1132,"Our first experience of this style of cuisine and we enjoyed it. Bewildering range of choice, including a lot of options to cook your own on a special hotplate built in to the tables. As we had a limited time due to going to the theatre afterwards, we opted for dishes prepared in the kitchen.",1
1133,"I ordered some wings from this restaurant and I gotta tell you I wasn't impressed. They were fried up looking delicious until I took a bite. It's like they were boiled before they fried them and that was a big problem to because it took the flavor away from them. After eating them, because I was hungry, I found myself in the bathroom for at the least 45 minutes. I kept having to go to the restroom through out the whole night and that was a problem. 
I will never eat from this place again.",0
1134,"So, rocked up here last night with family and friends for my birthday.

Me - ""Hi, have a table booked for 8 at 7""

Them - ""errrrr....?""

That was kind of the way the rest of the night went.

Drinks order took over 20 mins to arrive.

Waitress to order the food took as long again to come over.

Then better part of an hour wait for anything.

My meal came, out, everyone else got left waiting. Had to go up twice to chase up everyone elses food. Must have been at least another 20 mins before some of theirs came. I had long finished before the 2 katsu curerys came at the end.

Ill give them their dues, they were very apologetic and threw in a couple of rounds of drinks and some food to try and appease things, which softened the blow a little.

The food though, was really really good. Bitter sweet really. Bursting with flavours, cooked to perfection and well presented. No one had anything other than beaming smiles they tucked in and it was clean plates all round. Not a bad word to say about that.

Just a shame that the service was soooo bad. If you dont mind spending 4hrs in a restaurant feeling like no one cares about your experience, the food is .ore than worth it xx",0
1135,"We liked the food here that we ate twice during our 4-day stay in Seoul. They prepare it in front of you and the ingredients are delicious, but beware that it is rather spicy. You could also choose salads free of charge.
The price is also very good for what you get in return, which explains the fact that it was always almost full.",1
1136,The best place ever! Feels like home! Cozy and great atmosphere! We are a Cinder Couple and we love Cinder! Highly recommended 👌👌👌,1
1137,Best bar in Songdo with tons of internationals! Everyone who is visiting this area should consider coming by this welconing bar.,1
1138,"This is a great Korean BBQ place, provided you are willing to put through bad service, long waiting time and crowded space. 
I went here with family and we had to wait for about an hour, the lady at the restaurant was oblivious to the empty tables or the long queue extending outside in the cold. People in the queue were getting quite restless looking at the empty tables from outside. 
The food was like any Korean BBQ, nothing special. The pork and beef options were good, chicken not so much. 
They had a nice selection of desserts, however the staff was least interested in replenishing the ones that were over. 

I wouldn't go there again and don't recommend this to others.",0
1139,"This is a great place to have dakgalbi, a spicy chicken and rice stir fry. This dish is a must have for Seoul, South Korean tourists! Usually this dish is very spicy,but thankfully this place is used to tourists, so they don’t make it as spicy here.

The decor here is pretty nice and clean, more like a modern Western restaurant standard/feel. The tables have a kind of stove and when we ordered the dish, they brought a massive pot. They cooked the meat and rice for you, though you can do some of it yourself. That’s one of the beauties of eating like this, the active participation and freshness of the food you get to eat.

This dish is really tasty! There’s vegetables as well and it is saucy with a spicy, sweet, and savoury flavour. It’s difficult to a solo diner here because the portion is massive and I don’t know if they have “to go”.

It was about 20,000 Won.The price is moderate, compared to other cheaper places, but still reasonable and delicious. The service is very fast and efficient. I would definitely go here to have this dish again!",1
1140,I love Korean food so much and Korean BBQ in particular. We went here a little tipsy and left more that satisfied. I had a gochujang marinated pork dish which I had to barbecue on the in--table grill. My wife had a huge bibimbap with giant pieces of tofu on top and our friend visiting from the USA had a authentic kimchi and tofu soup (sundubu chiggae). Incredible food experience!,1
1141,"I am actually unsure if they changed to new management literally right after opening, but they changed their menu than what I had when I first went during their grand opening. Overall you shouldn't expect much other than super cheap AYCE KBBQ. The only reason why I'm giving it a two star is because they have terrible marinate for their bulgogi and they when literally some of the worst Kim chi I ever had in my life. I remember going here with my family on a Friday night at around 8 pm and we had asked for kimchi and our waiter said sorry but our chef is making some fresh kimchi... Overall when you are going here you aren't expecting quality meat but you can definitely get the most for your dollar. Although my rating is low I would go here again. 

I have included their brisket when I first went, but since then their slices are much thinner and smaller.",0
1142,"Nice and cozy bar.
The Owner Warren and his staff - Daniel, Mikey and Chris ( to name a few) know how to take care of their guests.
You will be surprised how they will remember your name and drink even with a packed bar.
Excellent drinks
But do recommend -
Fish and Chips
The flying chef burger
Worth the time, money and experience",1
1143,"A friend recommended this restaurant and we enjoyed a lovely meal together. I enjoyed the tasty food - from an excellent choice of dishes, but loved the intimate feel of this cosy restaurant. We went early on opening (5pm) and very soon after we could see how popular this place is with young couples. We didn't have courage to BBQ at table but what a lovely feature - I had only experienced this in Japan. I have planned to return - with more friends and look forward to my next meal.",1
1144,"Seoul Chako claims to serve korean BBQ but everything is extremely westernized and generic. They are the perfect example of a place that boosts quantity/variety over quality and even though nothing tastes bad, do you really want to spend money on something that's just meh? Prices are not cheap either (expect around $30 night time and even more on weekends). 

The restaurant is quite large and can accommodate large group of people.",0
1145,"As out-of-towners, we asked my bro where he'd like to dine for his birthday. We ended up at Korea House. Initial impressions were not great, little strip mall, tiny crowded room. Folks standing in line outside should have been our first clue. The service was slow, but the food was oh-so-wonderful. Like beef bulgogi? Bibimbap? Eight sides to share? Fresh ingredients served hot, authentic flavors. Dynamite experience and would like to sample other menu items soon.",0

1148,We ordered 1 starter and main dish for two person. All the Food came the same time. We ordered sweet and sour Pork. It was deep fried and NOT any mension in the menu. We sayd it does not look the same in the list.They did not care that at all.Can not recommend this place at all.,0
1149,"I called up yesterday (Wednesday) morning and booked a table for 6pm as was seeing Billy Elliot in the theatre opposite. I booked this with an open mind and was blown away! It's a very small, intimate restaurant that appears to be family run. I had the japchae to start which was beautiful, even if I was the only person in the restaurant to eat with a fork! My partner had the deep fried prawns which were MASSIVE! They looked beautiful but our main meals came out before we'd finished our starters so I didn't get to try the prawns. For main I had the beef bibimbap. I am so glad I went with the crowd. This dish was DELICIOUS. Rice with egg, tasty beef, spinach, onions - absolutely delicious and fun because you get to mix the ingredients and add sauce to your tasting. My Partner had pork belly with lettuce (taco-style). He said his meat was a bit gristly but the flavours were really good, as were the dipping sauces. It is very fast service here which was great as within an hour we had a starter, main, beer, and sake. In total we spent £53 which is a little pricey but definitely worth it for a treat. The sake wine is delicious, as is the Asahi beer. The restaurant picked up in business by about 6.30/7 and had a really nice atmosphere to it. If I go to Victoria Palace Theatre again, I'll be sure to stop here to try something new!",0
1150,"To start this is a make your own bowl style Mongolian grill. When I started to create my meal I noticed flys buzzing from each of the meats and other foods. 

After creating my meal the chicken was well over cooked and hardly edible. The wait staff was rude and unhelpful and my over all opinion would NOT come back to this establishment.",0
1151,We had a party of 9 here and everyone really loved their food. It's really unique to have a grill at your table which is easy and fun to use. All starters/bbq/veg options were really tasty,1
1152,I ordered take out for the first time today.  The Pad See Ew was delicious but I was very disappointed in the Pad Thai. It was very heavy on the vinegar and ketchup flavor.  I like a more traditional Thai style (savory) Pad Thai.  I had two bites and gave it to a co-worker.  That dish needs improvement,0
1153,"The food was awesome! But pricey.. It was a bit annoying that kimchi was not part of the appetisers and that the appetisers weren’t unlimited. As a restaurant owned by a Korean family, I expected it to be like a proper Korean restaurant in Korea. Nevertheless, the food was good enough and will be back for when I crave Korean bbq again.",1
1154,"the restaurant offers typical Korean restaurant dishes than home food. Overall, the food is delicious though a bit pricy.",1
1155,"Warning, this restaurant serves average food with really bad service. Soup has loads of msg, bbq meat is either too salty or bland! Staff don't understand English well, I asked to serve my main course after BBQ but they brought all out at the same time. And right when we were about to finish BBQ, lettuce leaves were out to the table!

I would have been better off eating in a top restaurants in Birmingham with what I paid!",0
1156,"Our first dining experience in a North Korean restaurant, totally run and operated by women folks from North Korea. If you are there for dinner, you could get to enjoy the performances - traditional and modern from waitresses that double up as performers. Waitresses were friendly and despite the fact that they have to multi-task, did not slow down the service.

The whole experience was quite strange. Food wise, that's not too bad at all but I would not return just for the food and the performance. Once is good enough.",1
1157,"In today's world of cookie-cutter chain restaurants and the-thing-of-the-moment-menu items, it is so rewarding to find a family owned restaurant presenting the ethnic food of their home country. And they present it well and at a tremendous value.
Four of us began with the wonderful seafood pancake accompanied with a sauce the waiter explained to us simply as ""pancake sauce"". Just wonderful. Then we ordered an entree of beef, of shrimp, of pork and the kimchee rice.
We all had to laugh when we received our food. With the companion dishes that come with any entree order, we had covered every inch of our table with various dishes and sauces. I won't list everything we ordered (previous reviewers have listed their own favorites) but it was all good, and some great (especially the seafood pancake).
And we finished every morsel.
No reservations so come early or you will wait for a table.",0
1158,"Okay, so here we are in Incheon and we want a cold beverage and something to eat. We've been here quite a few times and haven't been too lucky. We check out Trip Advisor and guess who's #1, Cinder Bar! We're reading the reviews and Warren, the owner's name keeps popping up. We head out to find The Cinder Bar.
We walk in and are instantly greeted by, guess who? Warren! He is one passionate and friendly man. He wants us to enjoy ourselves. The music was so great. We were hungry and he recommended a few items and they were delicious.
Warren is known for his famous gin and tonic, I'm not a fan of gin. He insisted we try just one, which we shared. I slurped it down and now I like gin and tonics.
We ordered his homemade dip and chips, chicken wings and fish and chips. All very, very good.
Warren, we're spreading the word, we had so much fun!",1
1159,"Great service.  Fantastic wings!  Can't wait to try other items on their menu.  Very disappointed they don't have a liquor license and was told it wouldn't have it for 2 weeks. Pure laziness as they've been working on opening this location for 4 months. I won't go back until I can drink a beer with my chicken wings!

This was our first meal in korea and didnt know what we're in for, staff pointed to our table we were given menus, we called the waiter to order when she arrived, she was too busy fixing her makeup and hair on the mirror wall (just wasn't interested).

Asked her if the food was spicy (we were eating with young kids) she said no, when food came it was spicy.

She just gave us a disgusted look, went away happily spoke to other staff came back again with another disgusted look.

The supposedly personally chef was meant to cook our food.

We waiting too long and started to cook our own food.

Couldnt understand why we were treated in this manner we were a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 kids spoke nicely to them.

Tried other restaurants for the next 7days food was better and services at other places was outstanding.

Later on I realised a lot of other people that came here were treated the same way, believe it, its true.

Don't waste your money here!!!!

Pros: OK food

Cons: Worst restaurant staff I have came across in my last 10 years of travel.",0
1162,"Do not come here if u are hungry. You have to be willingly able to wait for 1 1/2 hrs just for the food to come out plus an additional 20 mins to get in. There were a lot of angry customers when I went, some people had to cancel their order cause their food wouldn't come out while others were already eating. The food is honestly not even that good either, the customer service was also horrible. I advise you not to come.",0
1163,"Can't even compete with YC's. Sauces were either blah or strange tasting and overall, just not very good. Its edible, just not as enjoyable.",0
1164,"Poor service, staff cannot manage. Waited a long time to order in spite of calling out to staff. Apparently there is only one staff who can take order. After a long time she then came take the order of another group who came after us, when this was pointed out she said that she would need to ask her boss - who came first. Absolutely disgraceful. Needless to say we walked out. There are other Korean places to eat in Birmingham. Avoid.",0
1165,"I'll keep it short and sweet for this one...

1) Be very careful of all the raw meats being SO close together! I think I saw some people only using one tong for all the meats... eee!

2) It's hard to gauge how much spices/powders you put into your bowl... so be careful. Sometimes less is more.

Service is alright - you build your own plate, they cook it and then they bring it to your table, don't expect much but have fun with it, I guess.",0
1166,"I used to love eating here. Now they have all these changes and it's not fun anymore. For instance, if you are in the food line to pick your stir fry ingredients, and go back to an ingredient that you've passed prior, they will charge you $4.00.
I saw a lady get charged when she went back for a teaspoonful of chicken for her kid. It was not fair. They really need to look into these stupid rules cause people are getting irritated and just not going back instead of complaining.

1167,"Overall, this place is over-rated, as I assume people are fooled by its appearance instead of paying attention to the food selection and taste.

Despite the fact that the restaurant is listed as a restaurant, a label as bar may suit it better, because the menu is extremely limited. Besides, the food cannot even be called Korean fusion. It is purely a deviation of Korean based on misunderstanding. 

I ordered the kimchi fried rice and BBQ chicken. The fried rice is way too sour, as many other reviewers have stated, and you know that the kimchi is the problem. BBQ chicken is average, or let's put it this way, you can grill it yourself without any efforts. 

I didn't try any drinks, as many reviewers have said that they were too sweet. Good taste? Maybe, who hates sweetness? However, I don't plan to get diabetes. 

The restaurant is worth 3 stars, as you can tell that it tries hard based on its hipster decor and the Asian Fusion style. I will give it 2 stars to warn you that it is overrated.",0
1168,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday and had a great meal. Between the two of us we tried the pork gyozas, and basically had the BBQ. We chose the beer lamb, BBQ beef and the beef ribs. All very tender once on the BBQ, the ribs were a bit chewy though. Our bill came to around £40 and included two bowls of rice and some soft drinks. Overall, highly recommended if you're a beginner to Korean food. The only downside is that the ventilation isn't great so you do end up smelling like your food!",1
1169,"Korean and Sushi ....think again. We sat down and were given lunch menus with specials - all but one special included sushi! We made our selections not being informed of the recent departure as their name indicates. Still baffled as i write this why we were left to choose from the lunch menu. We then had to select again. Not impressed.  Green Tea?? Almost as much as an entree! 
Food came - it was good - not great.
Likely wont be back. Sorry Maru :(",0
1170,"Checked this place out for dinner tonight and so glad we did! After living in South Korea for a bit I missed having really good Korean barbecue. We arrived around 7:30pm and there were a few families eating. We were seated and taken our drink orders right away. There were 6 of us so we decided to get the Korean combo number 6  (79.99) which came with about 6 different types of meat. We also got an order of chicken teriyaki, steamed egg, and garlic edamame.

We were given all the yummy sides (kimchi, lettuce, radishes, seaweed, squash, beans, and a bean sprout salad) and we each got a bowl of white rice. Our huge meat plate came out quick and we got to grilling! Our waiter was friendly and attentive and made sure we had all that we needed. 

The fun part is the grillin! Throw the meat on there with the peppers, garlic, and onion, wrap it with the lettuce and voala its amazing! The steamed egg is a must try and so is the garlic edamame! We paid close to $150 for all that food but that also included their charge of $23 for tips. All in all the experience was fun and the meat was delicious! I will definitely be back, I felt like I was back in South Korea!

*wanted sushi but the waiter said they didn't make it anymore, :(",0
1171,"Had a good night here with the family. Kimchi was spicy and delicious. On the BBQ the spicy pork was our favourite. Soups had lots of flavour. Prices were fine, not cheap but no big shock when bill arrived. Negatives; there is no extraction system so the place is full of bbq smoke, clothes will smell after; and like other reviewers noted the service charge is hidden. It is put on the bill as tax rather than service and the waitresses are vague when ask them if service is already included or not. It is.",0
1172,"My duk mandoo gook didnt come out with the rest of the food and im hungry. Next time bring it with the rest of the food you imbeciles. When we asked for water, they said they would bring it, but they never did.",0
1173,"This is a restaurant that is definitely worth a visit. Heard from a friend that it is one of the only two North Korean restaurants that is not in North Korea. Food there is on the expensive side (cost us USD 34 for a stir fried pork, dumplings, kimchi soup, beef fried rice and drinks), but the show in itself is worth it! Food was pretty good as well!

The show consists of a series of dancing, singing and percussion. It starts at 8pm, so you may want to go slightly earlier to have your dinner and concentrate on the show when it starts. You are also not allowed to take pictures.

We went at about 8pm when the staff are preparing for the show and they looked a bit flustered and service was a little rude. However, this changed completely after the show and they were really friendly and asking whether you enjoyed the food and the show.

Highly recommended place!!!! Most tuk tuk drivers should know where it is so it should not be difficult to get there!",1
1174,"We visited on a Monday evening just to check it out. I tried the Bulgogi and it was good and tasted just like the Bulgogi I get in Korea. The Kimchi was also authentic, and they offer Kloud beer on tap so I had that. The service was excellent, provided by a kind and friendly Korean fellow. Prices were very reasonable.
There is a wide variety, a mix of Korean, Japanese and a bit of “pan Asian” on the menu – I suppose that Boulder is too small to support a Korean- only menu. As for beer, not so many Americans have heard of Kloud, Hite or Cass, so no wonder that more familiar brands like Asahi and Sapporo are also offered.
There’s a pleasant atmosphere with seating for around 30, so it’s not very large.
I would love to see a real down and dirty grill- at- the- table pork or beef Korean BBQ place in Boulder – I’ll bet it would be a big hit. But for the meantime, Korea House is worth going to, and returning to.",1
1175,"Heard this place is fabulous. Well, to me, it's not very attractive at all. Food is good but the service is horrible.
The lady who attended us was very strict about table arrangement - we're 12 total but not allowed to put tables together and sit altogether. No point insisting that while there is only couple more groups of people eating.
The waitress was really not friendly and the whole experience was so far from being pleasant.
Don't want to come back nor recommend.",0
1176,"The smell which hits you as you walk through the door is similar to that of teriyaki which makes your mouth water!
We opted for bbq and ordered a set of mixed meats and also sliced beef accompanied by goyzas both chicken and vegetables plus an aubergine.
The bbq grill is electric and we felt was never sizzlingly hot (like in Asia where they are mostly gas powered). There are no extractors over the tables therefore the whole place is really smokey with 12 grills on the go! Your clothes will whiff.
The service was a little sporadic.
All in all pretty good for somewhere out of Asia.",1
1177,"The waiter was very informative and would recommend their bbq. We paid just under £60 with drinks, bbq and two meals with a starter which is fairly good. I would recommend booking it as the place is quite small.",1
1178,"My friend and I loved Yoogane! We were the only non-Koreans in the restaurant when we dined in, but have no worries - the staff dealt with us well even though they all said their English wasn't very good. The menu is in Korean and English (and pointing works well too).

Be warned that portions are large so come hungry and make sure you take advantage of the side bar to get your kimchi fix in for free.",1
1179,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, he was really looking forward to it and that made me excited as well! First off, the feel inside of the place is nice (minus a little table-congestion), but we were sat in the corner, even though the place was almost empty! I ordered a margarita and my boyfriend got a beer, my margarita was terrible, it was bitter and a weird mix between shaken and iced, very odd. 
We got the meat deal (all of the meat plus all of the veggies), that was really great. The meat is marinated but I didn't have a problem with it. I loved the kimchi! 

The downfall of this place was definitely their service, my boyfriend and I were having a great time, until we ordered more food and asked for water. They forgot our water and then told us they lost our order (this happened twice). The server avoided us like the plague even though I was attempting to flag him down and did not check up with us once on his own. 

I may go back here because the food was good and the experience was unique but they really have to work on their customer service, which put a dark cloud on the entire evening!!",0
1180,"First time I've had a Korean meal, came across this place on TripAdvisor and read the reviews as protocol. The place was only 30metres from where I was so took a look with my own eyes. When it comes to eating out, the number one thing that friends ask me is, ""where can I get good Indian food?"" (I'm of Indian origin) and my answer is always the same, ""wherever you see Indian people eating"". I followed my own advice and opted to dine at Miss Korea as this is where Koreans were eating. They have the raw menu where you can cook your own meat on the built in grill on your table, like a self serve teppan yaki but my friends and I opted for the cooked choices. We enjoyed a smokey chicken teriyaki sizzling on the iron plate, the sweet and spicy chicken, veg noodles and the some of the crispiest tempura in a light and fresh batter. Sides of cucumber relish and kimchi. To not cloud the flavour we stuck with water as it was our first experience of Korean cuisine. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal and at the end we took guesses as to the bill, it came in under a third under our estimates! Full of flavour and excellent value, goes to show you have to try things and make your own opinions.",1
1181,"Terrible experience. Chicken was dry, portions of the fried chicken were cold.  Dumplings came out as a shrimp stew instead. When it came back from the kitchen, it tasted like they just fished the shrimp out and dropped some dumplings in. On a Saturday night, the front portion of the restaurant was closed so we could not order a cold beer.  Music playing in the background was a rap and R&B mix (strange).  Server showed his displeasure when we returned the items that weren't right. At one point both the male and female servers were taking shots with people at table next to ours. One of the females at the table was completely drunk (over-served) That's a violation of AZ Liquor Laws. I didn't eat the food. Looking forward to stopping by Jack in the Box drive through once we leave here. We will never come back.",0
1182,"I have been coming to this bar for two years now, and nothing is going to change. I love this bar.
The staff are super friendly, and also seems like a family :)
The Cinder burger is fantastic, and the rest of the menu is great, too.
The Cinder tonic is awesome. Totally my cup of tea.
From the live music, to the design of the place, to the very reasonable prices...
Just visit,
And enjoy",1
1183,"Came here with a group of 12. We made reservations and were seated right away. Our server took care of us and brought our drinks to us. However, when we placed our meat orders.. it literally took 1 whole hour and all they brought was 8 thin slices of pork belly and 8 pieces of brisket for 12 people after waiting a whole hour? 

No way. It was sliced raw meat to serve to the tables. How hard could that be? It was a Friday night and the house was half full. We didn't understand why it took so long, and given we were a large group with immediate plans after we stood up and left the restaurant only paying for the drinks. 

The place is probably good to come when it's not busy, but we were very disappointed with the service for food and went to another ayce down the street. Manager was nice about not charging the entire table with ayce prices when we literally had no food for awhile. Thanks but no thanks",0
1184,"It definitely caters to the Korean population because no one speaks good English around here and it is a hole in the wall kind of place but very clean. They only serve 2 bon chon but it is homemade pickled turnips and Kim chi is tasty. 

It's known for their soups and I ordered the combination but they don't give much meat or noodles which I am accustomed to in Chicago. Food is usually expensive in LV but I thought they should have served at least 4 thin slices of beef instead of approximately 1/2 that amount. Service is only average but this is the way in most Korean smaller restaurants. 

I'm not likely to recommend coming back because I have a small appetite and I didn't leave here feeling full at all.",0
1185,I don't get the high ratings here. Came because we needed to replenish our souls so we ordered the oxtail soup and handmade noodles soup. The oxtail soup had only four really small pieces and the flavor couldn't be more bland that you had to seasoned it yourself. No trace of any beef bones used to make the broth. The noodles had a nice texture but nothing more to it. $25 is rather pricey for two soups when realistically was barely enough for one person.,0
1186,"So this was my second trip...I wanted to get something that they were known for (instead of the wrap that I had before). I ordered a 10 piece strip mixed hall and half with an order of onion rings to go. There was no one in actual restaurant, one to go order picked up while I was there...so not busy. The onion rings attacked my sniffer the whole way home, I couldn't wait to rip in to them. I open the rings and they looked awesome, I open the strips and they look...they look like wings =( I'm eating them and they're good, but not what I ordered.",0
1187,"....where if you do not order soup the proper way, the owner chases you out. That's what this place reminded me of. I enjoyed by galbi/short ribs, although I have had much better. My wife enjoyed her dish, and when she requested hot sauce, the owner/server discouraged her from using it. We had read other reviews warning us of him, so we treaded lightly, lol. Decent Korean food, but we've had much better. If you visit, just nod your head and agree with the owner. :)",1
1188,"Delicious food, great atmosphere and caring service. What more can you ask for after a long flight. The Cinder Bar has an amazing beer selection from all over the World -- quite impressive. During my visit a patron 'rang the bell' and bought a round for the bar - so much fun!",1
1189,"Never been to a Korean restaurant before so can't really compare it but the food was great, fresh ingredients make for tasty different flavors from what I'm used to. Ambience is poor and decoration is somehow boring. If you can ignore this then its fine. Staff was correct. I'd come back.",1
1190,We only ordered two pieces original chicken and waited forever. There was only one person at the checkout while there were so many customers. People came way later than we did got to eat first and their Chicken taste like plastic.,0
1191,"I've been there a total of two times, and I always love the kimchi. However, the last time we went was a disaster. When we first got there we didn't get a word in before she started pointing at the menu items and recommending the common safe dishes like bulgogi. Since we weren't Korean she probably assumed we wouldn't like the soups(which is basically what they are known for). It doesn't make sense to recommend something that isn't a house specialty. Then after we ordered two of their soups she asked us if we wanted kimchi. What do you mean, would we like some? It's a Korean restaurant, of course we want kimchi. It's always a provided staple. Again, just because we were foreigners and she didn't expect us to be knowledge or appreciative of her cuisine. She never refilled our drinks even though the restaurant was small and we were one of two customers. The worst part was at the end of the meal. I left a cash tip on the table and my boyfriend went to go pay with card. After he signs the receipt and starts walking away she yells after him telling him he didn't leave a tip. He felt embarrassed, especially since she yelled in front of her other customers. If she had bothered to walk to the table she wouldn't have seen the tip.",0
1192,"I stopped in at the suggestion of coworkers. I wasn't disappointed. Warren (the owner) gave me a warm greeting and took very good care of me. The bar was a mix of local and expat patrons. Great selection of beer and although I didn't eat here, from what I saw the food looked very good (western style) and people seemed to enjoy it.

I'll definitely go back the next time I'm in Incheon.",1
1193,Will come here whenever I visit Seoul. The chicken is well marinated. Combined with noodles made a wonderful dish,1
1194,"With a new draught font increasing the variety of beers offered, you will find a beer to your liking.",1
1195,"The meal in this place is good and the salad is great. But this outlet in myengdong is terrible. How so? we came and the staff told us to choose seat. So, we choose seat in table for 4 person that comfy in the right side from entrance and sit there. And suddenly come other staff that look like it is the manager and he yell to us that we cannot sit there because there is 2 stove in the table, and move as rudely to table that have one stove in the back. And it is continue when we want to choose the menu, that staff tell we must have same menu because the stove is just one and menu cannot be mixed eventhough we wanted to have different menu and we forbidden to move back to that table. So, we comprise and got same menu because we already hungry. Later on, when we paid the bill that rude staff is in the cashier and give the change without saying anything. The other staff is still friendly and said thank you but look like afraid of that person. I will never come this place again, and recommended you to choose other branch in the end of this street if you want tasted this good food.",1
1196,"The whole experience at this location of Bonchon was disappointing. They have two entrances one for dine in which is the entrance next to Walmart and one for take out which is on the side where the Pet Salon is. The inside is spacious and nicely decorated. We came after the lunch rush so about 2pm and we were excited because we were avoiding the rush. Unfortunately we received the short end of the stick. 

We ordered Bibimbop, Bulgogi Korean tacos, and half and half combo fried chicken. The service was slow and the food came out about 20 minutes after we ordered it. The chicken seemed to be over cooked and dry but we didn't want to reorder and have to wait another 20 minutes for the food. I probably would come back for the bulgogi tacos but to go. 

So when we received our food the waiter told us he was leaving for the day and left the check on the table. Which was fine with us but he hovered until we filled out the receipt AND then stayed the whole time hanging out by the bar. So he really didn't leave just clocked out I guess. After we paid we did not receive any drink refills and I had to raise my hand for napkins. No one even cared that we were their only customers.",0
1197,"Feels like home, small bar, great food and drinks. You won't break the bank. Great for solo travelers. Highly recommended!",1
1198,We went to this restaurant thanks to tripadvisor recommandations but we were very disapointed by the food. We ordered 2 C set (beef bbq for 2 people) and the quantity was very small. Plus the food was not very tasty... We were forced to have another D set (mixed meat for 2). This time there was enough quantity for 2 but the quality was not there... To conclude i would not recommend it. It was also a bit expensive.,0
1199,"First off, it seems some of the reviews below are highly inaccurate. You should ignore them entirely, especially the one calling into question the English skills of the owner (with particularly well-placed poor grammar).

This restaurant is the closest thing to being in Korea that I have experienced in Colorado. I lived in Suwon, South Korea for more than a year, and this place captures the ambiance exactly. It's like eating in a Korean living room, with fun little decorations everywhere.

The food is fresh, tasty, and authentically Korean. We didn't order sushi, but kept to the Kimchi Jjigae (김치 찌개) and Kimchi Jeon (pancake). It was relaxing, and we had a great conversation with the owner over our food. After he learned that we had lived in Korea, he gave us a Kloud beer on the house!

Very friendly. Very helpful. Very tasty. If you want Korean food in Boulder, this is the place to go!",1
1200,"Had a fabulous meal, cannot fault it in any way. Our eating experience at Miss Korea was very enjoyable. This was our second visit and both times it was outstanding. Everything we had was fresh, the staff were very helpful and polite. I would highly recommend this restaurant if your willing to have a go at cooking some things yourself, it’s fun, and a must try for anyone who likes something different. For people who don’t want the BBQ there’s enough choice on the menu. Reasonably priced too. Excellent. Can’t wait to come back",1
1201,"Perfect cocktails, perfect beers, perfect music and perfect people! They are the perfect cinder crew with Warren, Hanna, Jimmy, Mijin, Nicole and Sam.. There, I can make music requests and they also have live music! I love this bar xoxo",1
1202,"Used to love going to this place. Went so often that one of the staff recognized my kids. unfortunately, this time wasn't a good experience. I usually order the daegalbee with noodles, cheese, and rice cakes. Its a dish that everyone loves. This time around, it was a different experience. The service was ok, but the food wasn't good at all. The cabbage was undercooked, so was the rice cakes. Over all, had a lot better experience before. I'm not sure if I will be going back. 

Pro

Unlimited side dishes (the mashed potatoes are awesome)

Con

Some of the food was undercooked or extremely hard. We had a hard time with the cabbage and I assume the carrots.",0
1203,Was excited to visit Miss Korea as I love Korean food... the food itself was alright but the service was so slow!!,0
1204,Good food and cute little place. The chef/owner is a great guy. Very attentive especially on a slow night.The food was hot and tasty enjoyed our meal.,1
1205,"I booked dinner reservation after reading the history of this place, expected the dinner to be a true royal cuisine experience. Disappointed from the seating. Two types of kimchi was given to each, it tasted like cabbage with water! Is this what the kings ate? They sure missed out on something delicious! There were a few dishes that were OK, but overall they food lacked seasoning, and tasted like it was made in a hurry, like the sweet and dry bulgogi. There were only a few tables dining, those of us who were hoping the reviews of poor food would be wrong.

On the other hand, the show was very well done, even my niece and nephew enjoyed it, and they don't speak Korean.

Skip the meal, it is overrated and pricey for the quality.
Enjoy the show!",1
1206,"That is the best experience I have had in any other bars I have been in. The bartender, Warren and his lovely assistants are the best persons to interact with in a bar. Not only did they teach me how to speak to korean people, and what to take care at during my trip to Korea, but actually they made sure we got home after a few drinks by ordering us the taxis.",1
1207,"I heard the hype about these Korean BBQ joints, so o checked one out tonight, and I wasn't impressed at all. All of there meats were barely seasoned, there vegetables have nothing on them at all, no salt or pepper. The chicken and salmon kept getting stuck to the grill, like wouldn't u think it would be a non stick grill, that fire is way to hot...and the service, wow.. Yeah they were fast but they kept forgetting things. 

I enjoyed there short ribs cause they seem to be the only thing that were seasoned. I can't get over the veggies, no seasoning or anything. I asked for a dipping sauce for the chicken and the waiter came with salt.  I guess there was a lack of communication on my part... Right.

The only thing really good about this spot is its open really late on Friday and Saturdays. I really wanted to enjoy my first Korean BBQ experience but left there wondering why we paid over 30$ for tasteless food.",0
1208,"The Cinder Bar features some of the best mixed drinks I've ever tasted. Ask for the Gin and Tonic, or signature Long Island Ice Tea made with all top-shelf ingredients! The best part of this bar though is that Warren and his staff take time to get to know you. When you come back, they remember your name and you can practically pick up your last conversation where you left off, even if its been awhile. You feel like you're among friends from the moment you step through the door. Don't miss out on this great spot in Songdo!",1
1209,"I'm quite confused about how this places gets good reviews. For a plate of vegetable dumplings, fried squid that was thin and covered in panko and oily and a plain plate of beef short rib (£15!!!!!) bulgogi without rice or anything, we paid £33 - what the actual help?! The portions were tiny too. We were given tap water in a re-usable pink plastic water bottle you use to take water on your bicycle and then at the end of the meal, 2 slices of orange on a plate. By far the most bizarre and most expensive meal we have had which was not worth even £5 to make. We felt this was some kind of joke. Still can't quite believe it. Both of us a size 10 - we went for food afterwards. Unbelievable.",0
1210,"After being in Korea for about 2 weeks on business I was getting a little tired of endless Korean food. Had a night by myself and found this place down the sheet from my hotel. The owner greeted me at the door and found me a seat at the bar. Had a great conversation with the bar tender, owner and a few of the other patrons. The food was excellent and the beer selection very different than the surrounding bars. Highly suggest asking the owner for his recommendations.",1
1211,"Delicious.  We always have the beef brisket soup and kalbi.  We love it.  The sides (ban chan) are always kimchi, radish kimchi and peppers (that you dip in spicy soy bean paste).  But this is really all you need for the beef brisket soup.  Traditional.  The side dishes are very good as well...but you cut yourself...which a lot of Koreans love this style.  Kalbi was very good as well...actually my daughters favorite here.  
The soup is just nice on cold day or as a hangover cure. 
The soups btw are bland...but traditionally the soup is served with salt, green onions and red pepper flakes for you to season yourself.",0
1212,"We ordered Dak Gal Bee as per everyone's suggestion and added cheese & rice cake as well as chicken.  Also, we had noodles added as well with a moderate amount of spice.  If you come super hungry, you'll find that it's pretty awesome initially.  The rice cakes, however, make you feel disgustingly full (+ the noodles) and midway through, I felt myself getting quite bloated and sick from it.  

Definitely a small restaurant and definitely worth giving it another try.  Come hungry though if you're getting that Dak Gal Bee.",0
1213,"We're starting explore the restaurants at yonge and sheppard now that my finance works there and thought i'd give this place a try. The food was not bad, tasty but I would probably not go back if I had a choice. Here is why:

At a glance
Price: $$
Rating: 3

Details:

Atmosphere/ D챕cor: 2
Meh... Nothing special, the place is not decorated at all, minimum effort. Reminds me of an old fast food restaurant.

Service: 2.5
Service was very mediocre.  There were 2-3 girls working in the front and approximately 3-5 more tables of 2-4 people during our time there and food still took FOREVER to get to us. Water was quick, but everything else including side dishes took forever. Considering that it was not a very busy night and it still took a while, i can't imagine the service when it is busy. 

Food:  3.5
The taste was alright. We ordered two orders of DakGalbee. Their min. was 2 orders which i found kind of stupid because i definitely wanted to try other things as well but didn't want too much food. When the food came, my finance's first reaction was is that one order or two? (I'm sure you can imagine the portion now) For the price of $12.50 for one order it was definitely not worth it. It only includes chicken and cabbage. We had added ramen and cheese($2 each) and even with those added, the dish was tiny. The side dishes was very mediocre- We had kimchi, potato (very good and creamy), radish and broccoli. 

Overall:
The food was okay, not worth it though for the price we paid. We paid over $30 including tips and for what we had- it was not worth it. We haven't tried DakGalBee in Toronto yet but we ate quite a bit of it when we were in Korea and can't compare.",0
1214,I arrived at 9pm to a couple of friendly wait staff in Warren and Owen. I was the only customer until all the flight staff rocked uo at midnight and the local koreans at about 1am. Made to feel like a local. Warren runs a great bar! Highly recommend,1
1215,"Nice drafts beer selection, very expensive bar, in the day of ours visit, about of the half of the food manue was not available",0
1216,"First visit and our family of four adults came as part of an evening out in Edinburgh to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday. The menu is varied - for both carnivores and vegetarian options. We tried the barbeque at the table - and this added to the experience as well as the flavor- with staff attentive and helpful, to make sure the food was prepared properly- cooked well but not singed and smokey. Marinades flavoursome with just the right amount of bite and side veg dishes crispy and tastey. We had dumplings and seaweed salad to start. Finished with black sesame ice cream I have travelled in Asia and experienced authentic local dishes and this was on par.
Smiling staff and service was great. We will definitely return- would be good for a light lunch or as we had- a full evening meal.",1
1217,"We were the only guests for the lunch and ordered two lunch specials and wanted to get kim-chi.
The owner told us that he can not sell us kim chi, since we have lunch special. Does this guy know how to run a business?
The food was average, but we were interrupted several times when he was trying to take our dishes while we were still working on them.
The only reason to come here is to have a meal in a quiet (read : deserted) environment.
Never more.",1
1218,"If you ever find yourself in the Songdo area of Inchon, you must visit the Cinder bar. Warren, the owner, is very personable and welcoming to new guests. I don't regularly drink liquor (prefer beer), but Warren makes a G&T that could convert me. This place is a must if you look for a bar with a laid back atmosphere and good food.",1
1219,"This place was takamatsu...now Arirang
Don't bother going...

This place was not prepared for a party of five and up. The customer service here is horrendous. We waited for awhile until the grill was cleaned. That's understandable if it took 5 minutes as discussed but it actually took them 20 minutes to clean. We had to ask for plates, drinks, sauce bowls several times until our request was fulfilled. It's bothersome when something has been asked of several times and they don't care. We were neglected as soon as the food arrived. No water refill. We had to wave a waitress down so many times for the bill. They are disorganized and the food was mediocre. Other Korean establishments are better.

PS. Party of five and up, be prepared for 18% gratuity! The price for bad service...Le sigh. 

Thumbs down!",0
1220,"Very good expat pub with a very friendly staff. They will get to know you and if you come back after being gone for months you will be greater by name.
Typical pub food that is pretty good.",1
1221,"Crap service, waiters are definitely high or something. They forgot so much stuff and just left it sitting on the counter. Waiter that couldnt pull his pants up managed to get mine wet by spilling water all over me and my phone. Never coming back here, overpriced for nothing but laundry service.",0
1222,"Had a staff night there on Thursday 17/03/2016. We were a table of 6 and I can tell that we all felt the same way. The food was really good and fresh. However, service was not that good. We asked for 6 wine glasses (BYOB by the way), and we had to ask them to change three of them as they were really dirty (one of them even had some salad on it!!!). Then, we ordered some starters to share which were all great and 6 main course. As 5 of us had our meals served after 45 minutes wait after we finished the starters (which were not cleared from the table), one of us didn't get his meal. We had to ask the waiter for the 6th meal, which they forgot about. I noticed during the dinner that other tables were not cleared until someone else was arriving... Overall, a descent restaurant with good prices but a poor customer service experience.",0
1223,My boyfriend and I discovered this gem last week. We had a set menu as Korean food is not familiar to us and it was fabulous (the seafood one). We both thoroughly enjoyed it and I've been recommending it to all our friends in the area. Well worth a visit! Finally something a bit different and I love the grills in the tables!!!,1

1225,"Get here while you can(not). Soju won't last 6 months.  I had the Bulgogi and my girlfriend had the Salmon.  Neither had any taste and mine was under cooked. 

The chef came to the table and didn't even introduce himself.  It was odd and uncomfortable.  

This is a typical Pittsburgh restaurant; wrong music, waitstaff wearing sports shirts and the food is below average.  

Soju wouldn't last 1 week in a big city.",0
1226,"My colleagues and I found ourselves in SW1 for an evening before a trade show and all agreed we should try something different. Being a tripadviser geek nowadays, I took charge and came across Lime Orange. With positive reviews and nobody being overly au fait with Korean food it was decided that Lime Orange would be the place for us!

Despite some recent, rather derogatory reviews I'm pleased to say that our experience was a overall a positive one.

The restaurant itself is pretty basic but clean and welcoming, which is unfortunately not a given late'ish on a Tuesday night in London.

The staff were friendly and accommodating at the beginning. Having not tried Korean before our likes and dislikes were taken into account before recommendations were offered for starters and mains.

But after that I would have to say that service was average at best. Although the food service was rather slow, especially considering we were one of four tables in that evening, I would never complain when the food is as good as it was. However, we did outline upon arrival (at 8.30pm) that our colleague needed to leave at 9.45pm for a conference call but come 9.40pm he still didn't have his main meal. Not a problem normally but our circumstances meant this caused quite the issue.

What irked me the most was the general service, which was a shame after such a positive start. In between serving and going to kitchen the staff stood with their back to the restaurant chatting among themselves by the till. This made it nigh on impossible to place a drinks order and it took me leaning across into their conversation to get their attention for the water we had ordered 10 minutes earlier.

The restaurant bills itself as Korean BBQ and there are even gas grills built into some of the tables. Our table had one but the only downer of taking the recommendations were that none of our dishes incorporated a BBQ element, which in hindsight seemed odd and an opportunity missed by the staff.

Service aside it must said the food was very, very good. Everything was fresh, tasty and the we all thoroughly enjoyed every dish we shared from the pickled beansprouts, vegetable dumplings, extremely refreshing cucumber dish to the lemon chicken, noodles and beef - to name but a few....I think we over ordered somewhat.

Another big bonus was the price. 4 people, multiple bottles of beer, wine, two courses each and sharing sides all came in at a very reasonable price of around £20 per head.

These two final points are the reason I have bumped this up from Average to Very Good. Poor service can easily be corrected and can be down to the individuals on the night but food of this quality at this price deserves to be shouted about.",0
1227,"This bar is newly opened and is an offshoot of another bar of the same name in Incheon City.
Very much nicer than all of the sterile airport hotel bars around this area. A lively welcome from Warren Kidd, the owner, who asks your name and introduces you to everyone in the bar. Makes for easy conversation and a friendly atmosphere.
The bar staff keep the party and conversation going by joining in - with a focus on encouraging the buying of rounds of drinks (""ring the bell and buy everyone in the bar a drink""!). Great for the profits, but also great for the atmosphere created. Genuinely enjoyable and a fun atmosphere.
I didn't have any of the food, but it looked like decent bar food (burgers etc).
A highly entertaining evening, marred slightly by the feeling that everyone was being pushed into drinking more. One of the best bars that I have visited.",1
1228,There were 10 small tables free and they refused to attend me apparently because i was alone and kick me out! If a Korean would go there alone will receive the same treatment?,0

1230,"Delicious Korean food in Edinburgh! Surprisingly delicious ! Bulgogi, stone rice and soup were all delicious. So glad we found Korean food in Scotland!",1
1231,"You may not give this restaurant a second look if driving down Charlotte but it’s definitely worth the stop. The food was delicious and hot (both temperature and spice) and you get a lot of it. Some lunch items were served in a steaming stone pot that kept the food cooking throughout the entire meal. The menu is authentic Korean cuisine with nearly 100 options to choose from. However, it’s not somewhere to go if you are looking for a quick business lunch. Lunch lasted about 90 minutes. It’s also not good for large groups (go with a group of 4 or less).",0
1232,"Stopped in for their lunch special. The Bulgogi box was very tasty, full of flavor and good value. The portion size was generous and included salad, dumpling and veggies. The restaurant is simple but clean. Will try dinner next time I am in the area.",1
1233,"Used to love their chicken and decided to try this location. Was not impress at all. Got the spicy wings for lunch. The wings barely had any sauce, maybe a little drip of sauce per wings on one side of the wing. Very stingy with their sauce. And the chicken was very dry also.",0
1234,"Food was nice when we got it, starter missed firstly then a main missed which came with rice which had to ask for again.",1

1236,"The first time I had Joons was on Bloor a couple of years ago with one of my best friends. I remember it being one of the best experiences I've ever had with food because we came in on a cold winter day and the food was piping hot and smelled delicious.

I've been to this location of Joon's before and I've had similar experiences, however, this time around, I think I have to reconsider what I think of Joon's.

I always order the Dak Gal Bee (JS1 or JS2, $12.50 and $13.25 per order) and there's a minimum order of 2. I always choose the Joon's original spicy sauce (decently spicy) and add rice cakes, cheese and ramen noodles. If I'm feeling especially hungry, I'll throw in a fried rice. All of these come at an add on price, ranging from $2.00 -$2.75.

For two people, we spent $38 after tips and taxes. For that price I think we could have had a much better meal in the area. I'm quite disappointed at how much I paid for... for a pack of ramen noodles and cheese with sauce.

I don't think I'll be returning soon....",0
1237,"If it wasn’t for the reviews of this place we wouldn’t have tried it.

Looks not a lot from the exterior but the whole experience of having your own personal BBQ on you table to the delicious meats you can try it was absolutely fantastic, definitely worth a visit if looking for something different!

We booked a table for around 4pm which in our opinion was a great time, not too busy and you didn’t feel rushed. staff were very helpful and even called us a taxi to the Playhouse after our meal, which was fantastic and saved us a very wet walk through the city.

If you are looking for something different from a chain restaurant and a little taste of Korean Food then definitely take a trip here - you’ll love it!",1
1238,"If you come here, you need to get their dak gal bi which is table cooking chicken. But if you like other korean stuff like pork bone soup or whatever, they have those too. This place gets packed pretty quickly on a busy day so be prepared to wait. 

dak gal bi is $9.25 per portion but you need to order a minimum of 2 portions. Table cooking isn't really meant for an individual. It's for 2 or more people. The $9.25 is the basic which includes the chicken, sauce, and some veggies. You'll probably need to top it off with some extras like rice cake, ramen, or rice. Some of these extras are cooked within the pot. 

Like other reviewers said, I find their portions smaller than I expected. But it's not a major thing as it's only slightly smaller than expected. With 2 people you should get some extras if you don't want to be hungry afterwards. 

i like how you can specify the spiciness. If you don't ask, they will give you default which is not very spicy at all. 

Overall it's a solid place for the dak gal bi. I haven't tried other things of the few times I've been here.",0

I ordered pork bone soup and 10 mins later I was told they ran out of rice and no substitute allowed. So if you run out of rice and can't offer me a substitute why am I here to eat food. The Manager said wait 20mins and the rice will be ready...I am not sitting here waiting for rice to cook, I can do that at home....if you run out of something then give me something else...I asked for noodles or potatoes and they said no....like WTF! I sat while my two friends finished their meals and left with no tip and never to return to this poor establishment.",0
1242,"Great little spot. Kind of hidden, basically the first place on the new city side of the bridge. Good food, good drinks. But like everything in Korea, it is small compared to American standards, no worries if the weather is nice, you can spill out onto the street.",1

Yam yam chicken are chicken pieces cooked or fried in sweet chilli sauce and what I got was not yam yam chicken it was just chieckn wings in some sweet sticky sauce. The same with udon noodles they were really oily and just avarage. I got to Kim Chee they do the best Korean food I was hoping that maybe I find resturant closer to me but unfortunately was left disappointed. I will not order or go to this restaurant again,",0

In addition, the waitress will make a scene about being badly tipped so I kindly explained that it's the second time we waited over 30 mins for our orders because the waitress for our orders again...it may be cheap but you can't expect good service. 
Lower your expectations and you'll be impressed.",0
1249,"This is the WORST restaurant that I've ever been to.  Me and my fiend went there on a Sunday night. Three things happened that ruined our experience there:

1. My friend found a piece of plastic in her soup. She told our server about it, the server showed that soup to the manager. We didn't receive any apology or explanation from the manager. Then the server scooped another bowl of soup from the same pot instead of making her a new one.

2. We receive a plate of sushi with the order ticket on top of it. Then our server put his hand on our food to take away the order ticket.

3. We brought bubble tea to the place. They told us that we are not allowed to take our drink with us and took it away. But when we finished our dish and ask for our tea, he told us that someone closed the fridge door too hard so our tea was spilled. We didn't even have a chance to take a sip before he took it away. He apologized, pulled out his wallet and gave us cash for the tea. But my point here is not about the money. We would like to drink our tea instead of getting the reimbursement.

A restaurant that can not keep their food clean, cannot keep the customers stuff, does not deserve five stars. 

I give one star because the food is average and there is only one server that was patient and nice when I explained to him that I'm not a cheap tipper in general. The reason that I only gave 10% tip is that the service and the cleaning standard need to be improved. 

I've been to almost all if the restaurant in Montreal but this one is the worst. Don't waste your 40$ with tax and tips included in this place. Go to Miso or park to have some proper barbecue or sushi.",0
1250,Me and my friend went to yoogane in Myeongdong. We ordered dakgalbi with additional ramen and cheese. The staff can speak english very well so there is no problem for tourist if we cant speak korean. They provide free water so we dont need to order drink. The best dakgalbi so far!!! will come back again when I visit seoul!,1
1251,"The name Yoogane is very famous for Dakgalbi. Other branches in Myeongdong are are OK. But this branch is terrible. The staffs who are taking care of the queue are not quite friendly. When we got the seats and started to order, they were not polite at all. We would like to order for the quantity that we could finish. (We also had a small child with us.) But they did not allow us to do so. They did not care that we had a small kid. More over, we came in 5 people, but they separated one of us to sit with the strangers in the table beside the rest 4. So .. NO MORE for this branch.",1
1252,"What a great spot! If you don't know anyone in Korea and want to meet friendly people, this is THE place to go! The owner, Warren, is from New Zealand, and goes out of his way to be helpful -- he can provide a wealth of information about Korea, in case you'd need advice. The bar has a wide assortment of beverages and food, and has live music some nights! Don't miss this place!! PS - if you need transportation from your hotel to Cinder Bar, Warren will pick you up in his car!!!",1
1253,"I have seen and eaten at many freaky restaurants in Africa and Asia, but this is restaurant is a different ball game altogether. It felt like I was in a place meant for North Korean propaganda and that experience alone deserves five stars.

Food is decent. Yes, there is dog meat if you want to try it. There is a limited beer selection.

But the best part of the restaurant is the waitresses and the videos. All waitresses are made to look like dolls and perform in between serving your food. Expect anything from a covering of Celine Dion to hardcore rock music. My waitresses hurriedly dropped food at my table and rushed to get on stage. It was quite the spectacle. And then there are the videos. Lush landscapes and beaches, which I assume are meant to project N.Korea is a good light.

Definitely visit if you are in the area.",1
1254,"Soju is a new and upcoming Korean restaurant in Bloomfield that is highly overrated. Me and my group of friends were craving authentic and well-made Korean food and we saw this place open up and decided to go.

The first impressions of this store were promising - the decor was contemporary and waitresses friendly. However, we were given A4 paper menus with a limited selection of choices. I ordered the bibimbap for 18 dollars (it was 14 dollars + 4 dollars for beef which I thought was absurd and reflects a poor pricing strategy). The food itself was pretty good, I would argue a little too sweet but given the target audience it makes sense, but absolutely not worth the price of nearly 20 dollars. The bibimbap also comes with no side dishes, a necessary practice in Korean cuisine.

TLDR: service and ambience is good, food is decent, but definitely not worth the price. Would not come again.",0
1255,"I used to like hitting up Korean barbecue for it's late night special I believe it's about 10.99

The bothersome part about these guys is that they only take cash. It gets really annoying and it deters me from going there quite often because I don't carry cash

Prior to their renovation I saw a rat on one of the tables. No word of a lie. A rat. Before I could blink it was gone and Asian man from the kitchen had a pitcher of hot water chasing something down the side of the restaurant.",0
1256,"+ meat is very good quality. Sushi are good too. during weekend they have more options and also have a fridge of desserts variety (cake, pudding,etc). they offer a midnight menu. Good options for a Late night dinner at decent price.

- getting service and the attention of server to ask something takes forever. Takes a bit of time to reserve food. Server doesn't pass to refill water-you have to ask it takes a while to get it. You have to pay for soft drinks (other all you can eat I go usually doesn't make you pay soft drinks), wish there were a bit more sushi variety.",0
1257,"Went with family. Really enjoyed the food. Having been to most of the restaurants in China town, I can say the quality was one of the best. Service was quick considering how busy it was",1

1259,my Korean Mum has reserved a representation here. Koreans seem to be very proud of their folklore. I found the representation nice but i was not impressed. Subtitles are in English available. You can take pictures with the dancers at the end and there is a very nice shop with high end artcrafts.,0
1260,"Went here @ night and ordered the famous soup and the bulgogi, the soup was just meh, so bland like no seasoning whatsoever, however, the bulgogi was on point. 
The Kim chi that they serve as banchan was really good however, they bring a pot of it to your table and cut them up for you.
Now, the service leave more for desired, we tried to get the bill/pay for the food for 45 mins and they totally ignored us, even tho she saw us wave at her.... and they never gave us more water or anything. 

+1 star for the bulgogi and +1 for Kim chi
-5 stars for the services 
Will not be back",0
1261,"I was grabbing a quick meal before catching a train so ordered two starters. I was disappointed in the Bolgogi Beef Salad as the beef was served cold and the salad itself was overdressed. The glass noodle salad with the same Bolgogi Beef, but served hot was so much more pleasant. Other Koreans do serve their salads with heated beef and it helps the flavour really come out nicely. Not particularly a warm experience, no real welcome or send off, but I would pop back in if I was craving Asian near Wicked or the Victoria Station and in a hurry.",0
1262,"Came here twice and ordered the Dak Gal Bee both times. Although it was good, it's a bit expensive especially for the portion you're getting since you still would have to add on more toppings to make it worth it. The Kimchi Fried Rice was good though. It's accessible because it's right outside of Sheppard-Yonge station and there's a lot if parking (that you would have to pay for) around, however the restaurant is really small. But you get seated fast because it's rarely full.

Overall it was pretty average.",0
1263,"I read a few of the reviews on this page and I wonder if we went to the same restaurant. The room was filled with smoke with no fans for ventilation. The server opened the door to outside to ventilate the room, meanwhile, it was 40 degrees outside. Pricing has changed to $22 for dinner, no regular and premium option. They also don't have Galbi on the menu anymore. After walking in, one of the servers took our order, and shortly after, another came to take our order again. While I really believe that the server was very courteous and apologetic, the organization of the servers is seriously lacking. Food was forgotten left and right, and it seemed like they did not communicate with each other at all. Additionally, they were out of romaine lettuce and shrimp, which was very disappointing. Food was mediocre, and only 4 banchan sides, which is on the lower end. Probably would not return, but would like to check out the other K BBQ restaurants in the area.",0
1264,"This is one of those restaurants that at peak times have lines of people waiting to get in for a nice filling meal.

I went there for lunch since that is usually my heaviest meal of the day, and I don't like to have a buffet at night, so close to sleep time. 

I got seated promptly and decided to order several standard items on the menu.   Here's my review..

Short ribs - Delicious, nicely seasoned, good size
Spicy sausage- A winner !!   LOL...
Fish fillet - nice and thick, lean pieces of meat, delicious
Chicken teriyaki - OK, not great
Short rib noodle - Too salty for my taste, not a return item for me
Fried scallops - crispy, delicious, nicely done
Spicy Escolar roll was OK, not the best sushi, but ok
Salmon Nigiri was again, OK, not the greatest
Short Rib fried rice was OK, I rather have the short rib meat and the steamed rice separate.
Mango ice cream, did not agree with my lactose intolerant stomach LOL..

Overall a nice buffet, if you find what you really like and keep eating it.   Prices are higher Friday - Saturday - Sunday.  

The staff is hurried and not very smiley nor responsive, but I have read about that before, so I was not surprised.",0
1265,"I thought I'd feel really cheated in grilling my own meat, I was wrong it's super fun! The only previous Korean BBQ experience I've had, the waiter grilled everything in front of us, it was delicious..and awkward.
Turns out Seoul Chako has grills embedded in tables so you are the grill master! 

Sadly that was where the fun ended for us. The vibe is odd: they obviously want to be this cool lounge, but it's essentially a buffet, so expect a loud, continuous flow of employees bussing dirty plates everywhere. The selection is good, but you'll be lucky if you end up with what you ordered! Our pork became pork belly, we got less veggies than advertised on the menu, if we got them at all, and the pineapple order will get you one (1) slice. That's it! Our waitress was super efficient otherwise, so efficient that around 10:00pm she ducked down below our table to turn off our grill.. 15 minutes later she explained the kitchen would be closing. The food is good, but the portions are somewhat small, which is to be expected, so get the most of your $27!",0

1267,"I was on business in Korea, and my work colleagues took me out for a beer after work. Arrived at The Cinder Bar, which was my friend's regular. Primarily because it is one of the few true Expat Pubs in all of Incheon. The Kiwi, Warren, runs the Pub, and he was most hospitable. We settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely. Even had time for some fish and chips: the fish was covered in golden batter, and the chips were delicious. The bar looks a little broken down (as was the area it was located in), but that added to the charm. If it was a rugby night, you could watch the TV, but it would've been a bit of a squeeze. There was also an upstairs, loft-style area.
Overall, a pleasant evening after work.",1

Price is not a problem for us even though this restaurant has an average price of over 14,000 won but the appetite is something that is very privacy for us, the stupidest decision I made when traveling to South Korea was to go to this restaurant. this is serious ... don't be tempted by the crowds of people you see from outside the restaurant, stay away from this restaurant from your visit to the itinery.",0
1270,"I had high expectations for this place and I wasn't totally let down, although also not as good as I was expecting. Let me explain. 

We came for lunch on a weekday, and only a few tables were filled. Service was average throughout. We decided to split the 10 piece wings (half spicy and half soy garlic) and the bibimbap with bulgogi (other choices are tofu and spicy chicken) amongst 2 people. The food came out pretty quickly. The fried chicken was very crispy, though more sauce/flavoring would help it out more. We were also given 4 drumsticks even though we ordered all wings. The bibimbap was a letdown, especially at almost $14. Maybe my expectations were too high but it was just a lot of white rice in a hot stone bowl topped with veggies that weren't especially outstanding. Not a large portion of meat either. So next time I'd stick with the fried chicken. I also wish the meal came with kimchi instead of requiring us to order it as a side item. The fried chicken does come with pickled radishes, which balance out the salty greasiness of the chicken nicely.",0

1272,This is an okay Korean place. It has the Korean grill option and an a-la-carte menu. The place has a very strong smell from the grilling so your clothes will start to stink!,0
1273,We order he big dish and it was pretty good. The pork bone soup wasn't good because it wasn't hot enough. The kimchi fried rice was pretty good. The side dish was too small since we have 11 people. The funny thing is they want us to finish all the seed weed before they could give us a knew one. That was disappointing because one of the seed weed wasn't finish because it was on other table with us. It just a normal restaurant where nothing really special to me.,0

The drink selection is fantastic. I personally enjoy the Monteith's selection from New Zealand; especially the Radler!!
Food-wise, the wings are my favorite, but it's the Cinder sauce that make them absolutely divine!!

The Cinder Bar is the new mover and shaker in the city of Songdo.

But the manager wodnt let her ger seated unt at least there were 5 people and if no one came in 5 minutes they were gonna give the table to someone else.We were stuck in traffic and since no place to park, I dropped my mom, daughter and aunt and went looking for parking. After 20 minutes turning in circles I find a paying parking lot. I finally arrive and there is no room for me. I had to go get my own chair to sit because the manager gave one of our tables away. My brother had dropped his wife and kids and was looking for parking. I had been sitting for 15 minutes and no one had yet come and got me a plate or glass of water. 6 out of the 11 had already started eating. The tables are not proportionate whether it was a small or big  ne, there was only one bbq in the middle. Not practical.for those on the corners.Then the waitresses just came and shoved plates around in front of me not knowing who ordered them.  I tell one of them I just came and if they can get me a plate and menu. They don't say anything. Then the manager comes and  starts serving wine. I tell him what is this setting. How are we going to be able to eat properly? The tables are not proportionate. Not like the bbq on our bigger table is any bigger. He says yeah, it's true and keeps pourring the wine. 10 minutes later, still no plate or menu. I tell him will not be eating there so not to bill me and that their service is shit. He says ok and leaves. I couldnt beleive it. He didn't even apologize and offer any thing for the bad service. So I get up and leave. Since my daughter had already ordered and started eating,  she stayed with the resr of the family. I went back simply to pay for my daughter's bill and they had the audacity to add tips automatically. I refused to pay the tips. Then he says sorry but you know it's Saturday and it gets very hectic. I  tell him it is not my problem or responsibility. This restaurant had no respect for their clients and to top it all off it's too pricey for what you get. Don't waste your time and money.",0
1283,"We visit this restaurant when we are in Edinburgh, we love the food, we love the people and we just love sitting as a family cooking our meats on the grill in the table. The endless salad is just delicious, the starters are fantastic especially the Takoyaki (octopus) and then we always have the D-set menu of mixed meats - pork belly, marinated pork, marinated beef, marinated chicken and little steaks. Fabulous! Will see you again soon.",1
1284,"I like Korean food, that is why I decided to go to this restaurant despite so many Arabic, Indian and Turkish restaurants to try from. And I was happy with my decision. I had the ramen noodles - spicy and quite a big bowl, noodles were just right, fresh vegetables. Along came the mandatory Korean side dishes. All of them tasty, kimchi included.
Very nice and attentive waiter. Place is modern, neat and you have K-pop music to go with it, together with Korean music videos on the tv screen :)
I did not try other food, but left with a full stomach and satisfied. Give it a try, I am certain there is other good stuff as well!",1
1285,"Our Nami Tour started and ended at Myeondong. We went there early to make sure we make on time. During our ocular at Myeondong, we saw this galbi restaurant called Yoogane, so after the tour we headed to this galbi place. It was not surprising that their galbi was really good because the restaurant was full. We ordered half half galbi meaning half classic and half spicy chicken galbi. Their side dishes are self service.",1
1286,This place is good for lunch because I love their bimbimbop but that's about it.  My wife ordered AYCE sushi and I tried a few roles and it tasted like grocery store sushi.  Seriously.  GROCERY...STORE....SUSHI.  That is lame.  If you get AYCE (for $25 no less) it better be somewhere in between hi quality Ala cart and grocery store.  I'm pretty sure Albertsons has better sushi.  I also ordered the Korea BBQ Pork Belly and that was equally as disappointing.  The meat had no seasoning and no flavor.  I mean seriously didn't the silk road back in the day from east to west involve some kind of spice trade.  Somebody better let this Korean BBQ place know because I don't think they realize salt even exists.  The worst part about all of this is that this place is horrendously overpriced.  I had my daughter with me and I almost had to leave her as a tip.  Don't go here.  Drive the extra 10  minutes and hit up some of the Korean BBQ place in China Town.  So much better.,0
1287,"We went there because we already knew about the Korean Barbeque, and when we saw it walking around the area we thought to come and try it, and it was an amazing success.

We ordered a Seafood pancake, Chicken Gyoja, a Kimchi side (to try it since it is something typical from Korea) and the Mo Dum Gu I (Assorted meat bbq selection). Everything was really good. The seafood pancake was nothing special, but it was nice and tasty, more pancake flavour than seafood, but it was nice overall. The chicken gyoja were really nice, the Kimchi side is something you have to try at least once, and it was something spicy, crunchy, fresh and with a lot of flavour, even though is a side measure, it is quite a nice portion, so keep in mind if you just want to try it. And the best for us was the Mo Dum Gu (we got the Assorted meat bbq menu that includes salads), it comes with 2 sauces, one spicy and delicious and another of sesame that it was also really good, also comes with lettuce to make wraps (and when we ran out of lettuce they brought us more without charging for it), it also comes with some salads to fill your wraps or eat them alone, delicious, spicy and tasty. And the meat selection is top notch, everything was really nice but our favourites were the Pork neck slice and the Darkgalbi, both of them marinated. It includes also 2 beers or 2 soft drinks, but as we were ordering a bottle of wine, Pinot Grigio Veneto, we didn't ordered them. They brought to us some special radish to taste and include in the wraps for free, it was really good and it fits perfectly with the pork belly wraps.

Since it was rather late and we were quite full we decided not to order any dessert but we will do for sure the next time.

The waitress and the waiter were friendly, helpful and professional, they didn't step in too much in our table and we didn't have to wait for anything, they were really attentive and smiling.

Since we had a lot of food with sauces and we were eating slow, we got replaced our grills twice, but it was made with the best of the attitude and they were not intrusive or disturbing at all.

The experience was amazing, we will come back for sure and try other dishes and desserts.

As recommendation for the staff, you could put a sign on the corner of the street to make more noticeable your place, because you deserve all the possible attendance and success.

Cheers!

Natalia and Aingeru.",1
1288,"For your own sake, please DO NOT GO ANYMORE OR AT ALL!!!!!
I wish there's NEGATIVE rating here! This is place is horrible! Not kids friendly, not customer friendly! My husband, me and our kids (3 of them) came for lunch. My kids are not very quite, but well behaved. But the guy (I think he's the owner) said I should watch my kids, how rude! And we wanted to order sushi roll, he said he can't make it. So we ordered 2 lunch specials and 1 hot soup, but he says lunch special is very small, then I asked him how small, then he started to give us very bad attitude! So my husband said let's go to a different place, then he said if you come next time I will call the police! This place is totally a JOKE!!!!",0
1289,"I love this bar. All crew members are so nice and seem to enjoy their work. The atmosphere is cozy and lively. Every drink you can get is excellent, especially G&T is just amazing. You'll love it :)",1
1290,"ive gone here many times service is getting worst and worst
theyre cheaping out on the sides. they make you wait for it now till ur mains come
and theyre REALLY slow on refilling it, and the servers are really sleazy about it

the ones near ossington station are WAYYYYY BETTER",0
1291,"The food is average, and they were extremely rude to my family. The restaurant is always half-empty (at best) and they made a point to come tell us my two year old was being too loud. She wasn't doing anything other than talking and playing in a normal voice. They then proceded to rush us out and tell us we weren't welcome to return. I will never set foot in this place again. If you go, don't bring your kids.",0
1292,They have changed the price of the menu. It is more expensive. I have eaten a not-big plate with normal rice and chicken with 7.99. You had better spend a little bit more money to get a lunch buffet instead of choosing this place. (If you want to fill your stomach) And there are no lunch specials anymore. So disappointed :(,0
1293,"I am from Korea(South) and I know the real taste of Korean dishes. Found this restaurant randomly and wanted to give it a go. I have noticed that most of Korean meals that you can try overseas can be a little bit different from its original taste.
I have tried a few Korean restaurants in Edinburgh and this place is actually good.
Ordered three dishes and all of them are really tasty. We(two of us) cleared all of them. Fine dishes! Loved it. I gave 4 stars for two reasons: 1. Parking can be a nightmare 2.Price is slightly higher than other restaurants. Am I going back? For sure!

If you want to experience, try this one or Sodaeng which is another good one to recommend. Good luck! ^___^",1
1294,"The owner is incredibly sweet and caring. You can see it in how he talks to his guests and how he cares deeply about his business and the community of Songdo. I was studying abroad in Songdo for about a year, and I can easily say that going to The Cinder Bar made me feel right at home and also very welcomed in a country/place that I was new to. Warren is not only kind, but also innovative. The food is delicious. I can't get enough of the fry dip! And he always had a new drink recommendation for me and my friends that we always loved! He is always reaching higher and making The Cinder Bar a fun, exciting, and comfortable place to meet up with friends and enjoy the night. Highly Recommend! Definitely swing by!",1
1295,This is one of your typical grill your own Korean places. Meat is fresh. Portions are large and the prices are reasonable. Only 3 sides with the meat less than what I usually get. They could also use another server but overall a good non tourist experience.,1
1296,Lovely ambiance and good food. Love the stone pot bibimbap! It's tucked away in a small space but well worth seeking out.,1
1297,Bit expensive . But food is ok for a change though it's nothing extra ordinary. Located in a bit of a crowded place so indoor dining advice.,1
1298,"What a great spot! If you don't know anyone in Korea and want to meet friendly people, this is THE place to go! The owner, Warren, is from New Zealand, and goes out of his way to be helpful -- he can provide a wealth of information about Korea, in case you'd need advice. The bar has a wide assortment of beverages and food, and has live music some nights! Don't miss this place!! PS - if you need transportation from your hotel to Cinder Bar, Warren will pick you up in his car!!!",1
1299,I was actually expecting the worst from my first impressions but by the end it wasn't that bad. I would have given it a 3.5 star. Girl at the front needs to learn how to smile. Zero character!!! Tables were dirty and had to ask them to clean it. But the food was half decent. Nothing to what I am used to when I am in Hong Kong where I normally have my Korean BBQ fix. Would I go back?? Maybe but I always do in HK!!,0
1300,"This restaurant is like the setting of a 60s Bond movie. Food overpriced and too spicy for my sensitive palette. Waitresses creepy and unfriendly, only smiling when presenting the bill. An alienating experience. Was so hungry after, had to buy so.e dumplings from a roadside stand .",0
1301,"I ordered their original olive chicken and their sweet and spicy chicken. This place is pretty pricey for the food that you get, but I will say that their original olive chicken was a good starter to go with. However, I think their sweet and spicy chicken was a bit over spiced. I normally am okay with medium spicy foods, but this was way too spicy for me. 

I got my food relatively quickly, although the service seemed chaotic in the back. I also got the wrong order, which I didn't notice until later (I got take-out). I wish they had more options (especially with their garlic trio option - I would've liked to have been able to try one or two of those flavors without having to order all three), but this place seems decent. Their menu screen kept flickering, which was slightly annoying when I was trying to read the menu. I'd honestly probably wait a couple of weeks to a month before coming here again, and hopefully by then they've added more options / finished polishing their recipes.

side note: Thank goodness I ate the original chicken first, because after the sweet and spicy chicken, I could hardly taste anything because my mouth had gone numb.",0
1302,Nice food.. Very delicious.. My friend enjoyed also place its cozzy and comfortable. The price its very affordable for the delicious food... The staff also are so friendly.,1
1303,"Service is slow, have to ask for refills or slurp your straw.  Daeji bulgogi, short ribs, and  bulgogi are as good as any other KBBQ.  Kim chi Chigae and Dumpling Tofu soup not good, the flavor is just not right.  Side dishes are average.  Takamatsu was way better.  No kimbap.  Probably won't be back.",0
1304,"The Cinder Bar is out of the main area of Songdo yet it is the best bar. The drinks are phenominal. I would reccomend the Gin and Tonic which is a killer. The prices are incredible compared to other bars in Korea. The best part is the incredible atmosphere. The music is great and the everyone is incredibly welcoming. Especially Warren the owner and bartender of this place.

PS Order the Cinderella. Its on the secret menu. I can garantee that you will love it.",1
1305,On my first visit to South Korea I stumble into this bar where I was greeted as if I was coming there for year leo was amazingly hospitable nice friendly Very engaging and I feel as if I have known him all my life I definitely made a lifelong friend and Leo Makhil the cook was also very nice and food was great definitely a must stop when visiting South Korea in each one in particular I hear great things about the OG cinder bar which on my next visit I will be attending Ask for Leo he is the best!!,1
1306,"I have mixed feelings on this place for my first visit. I reserved for 5 without knowing how big this place is. We turned out to be six sitting at a table for 4. Kinda tight. My girl and I enjoy discovering foods. We loved the octopus balls. Dumplings were a little too crunchy. I'm used to steamed. I had the bibim something. Quite tasty but I screwed up and drank my miso instead of pouring it in. My bad. I gotta try it again. My friend had a large soup. She really enjoyed it especially with her cold. The others had mixed feelings especially with a really late plate. They enjoyed themselves because of the company but indifferent about the food. One had pork chops which looked like Shaken Bake. I think she should have ordered better.

1308,"Unimpressed with the food. I lived in California for 20 years where we had access to numerous Korean restaurants. I was so excited that bulgogi was on the menu so we ordered that, Korean fried chicken(1/2 and 1/2) and kimchi coleslaw. The bulgogi was disappointing and bland, the chicken was too salty tasting, and the kimchi coleslaw was just regular coleslaw with some kimchi added.

If you've had good, authentic Korean food before, don't bother with this place, otherwise you'll be disappointed! Gave two stars because the service was good.",0

Du Poulet Pop Corn, et quelques autres trucs. Je parle du poulet pop corn parce que c'챕tait d챕licieux. Le prix ? 21.99$ pour un repas a volont챕 et 14.99$ a volont챕 le vendredi soir.

Ive been here many times and as usual the service is what I always expected which is bad...
Servers will either ignore you or walk away if you don't raise your hand up to get their attention.
Also lately they don't give everything you order they always limit the side dishes depending on the amount of people sitting.
But with all these things I still come here as I prefer it over Chakos 
Food is what it is I mean its AYCE I'm not expecting good quality meat but its decent
Overall this place is still my late-night goto for KBBQ",0
1313,"Pretty restaurant in the new Kingsley area in Fort Mill. Not busy on a Tuesday night we were seated quickly downstairs. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. I'm giving 3 stars because the appetizers were great but our mains were just okay. We shared the tuna crispy bites, KFC wings and dumplings. The wings were the best part of our meal, hands down. Definitely order those! We ordered a couple of drinks; my blackberry cocktail was delicious. The Collins cucumber/strawberry smash could've been better. Seems like the menu consists of raw tuna, raw salmon, bulgogi beef and pulled pork in different iterations. The tacos were not very flavorful; I wouldn't recommend those. Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back just for the KFC wings alone.",0
1314,The only reason I didn't give Lime Orange five stars is because our soup was not hot. Other than that the food was excellent!,0

I live between middle TN and Santa Monica, so I travel between the two areas a lot ... often driving. I've had a lot of Korean in LA and Korea House rivals or exceeds many of the restaurants there. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. The decor is nothing special .... just good food. I've been there many times since my first visit and it is a place I'm glad to take visitors or meetings.",0
1317,"Interested to try yoogane after seeing the way they cook the food on our table. But all are chicken menu, and the problem is if we are on the same table, we have to choice 1 menu, maybe because they cook on our table. If you are 3 or 4 people. Then you have to choose one. As a traveler we prefer to try several different foods instead of one choice. Taste is not bad, maybe chicken is not my favorite.",0
1318,"There are now a number of outlets of Yoogane in Myeongdong area but we decided to visit this one instead, finding it to be more spacious with more tables.

Staff speaks simple English and is very friendly and helpful. We ordered 1 non-spicy for the kids and 1 spicy for adults.

The non-spicy portion turned out to be a little salty but the kids loved it. The spicy portion was great and not too hot for Asian level of hotness. We concluded that the spicy one was better compared to the non-spicy one.

We found out that the side bar only after the meal, since the staff didn't explain it to us during order.

Overall we had a pleasant experience with the service and food offered.",1
1319,"I used to eat here ALL the time when it was Takamatsu and loved it!! Then they sold and it got really bad and then worse.... Today we gave it another try and we are glad we did. New interior and the food is at the quality it was before. No sushi though. I had the bulgogi with the little dishes of kimchi and it was great! So happy that this place is picking itself up again. 

4 stars because the tea was bad tasting and no sushi. 

I will be back!! :)


UPDATE: And they have lost another star! You guys are KILLING me!!!! Take Sushi OFF your sign if you are not going to have sushi. Clean out your disgusting tea container! Tea is cheap and there is NO reason to have rotten tea. Clean your table grills! No one wants to sit and look at dried up old food while eating. 

Potato salad in a Bento Box??? WTF!",0

This place is awesome, 2 levels of drinking, eating and privacy! Off the beaten path, can’t hear traffic or noise from outside! Great beer selection, Fish and Chip is actually great! Can’t believe I’m saying that but it’s the best in Incheon.
You feel like your at “Cheers” when you are there! Sam Malone would love it!",1
1321,Wife wanted Korean bone soup. Haven't had it in a long time as we can't find it in San Francisco. Looks really authentic. We aren't Korean but we lived in a Korean neighborhood before so Korean soup is like comfort food for the wife. Down to earth restaurant where they play Korean videos on their tv. No subtitles. Have no clue what is showing. Ha Ji Ma!,0
1322,"We ordered Beef Bulgogi which the menu said it had fruits in it. It came just with fried beef and a few pieces of capsicum in it for £9.20. The food gave me a tummy ache after that. The service was appalling. The guy at the counter was on his phone, without a care in the world. He was quite smelly as well.

I will never go that way in my life again. Absolute rip off. I'm sorry to write this, but it was rubbish and waste of money. I don't know how people are putting good reviews on this.",0
1323,"One of the best Korean BBQs I've visited - their bulgogi marinade is absolutely on point, and the kimchi pancake was wonderful.

We ordered the mixed meats set menu for 2 and were treated to a quick overview of how to cook our food (we'd been to a Korean BBQ before so didn't need the full demonstration). Our grill plate was frequently refreshed, and all the meat was absolutely top quality. The pancake appetizer took awhile to come out, but we were given a bowl of amazingly tangy kimchi to make up for the wait - perfect spice, great texture and flavour.

The staff is charming and helpful and the food was perfectly composed.

Finish off your lettuce and sauces? No problem - they'll bring you more right away!

If you enjoy cooking and like to ""play with your food,"" this is a perfect night out. Just be sure to come with an appetite - that set meal for 2 is really enough for 3 or even 4 people!!",1
1324,"Great pub atmosphere. Warren is very friendly and really appreciates his customers. Thanks for the Rugby lesson. Nice relaxing time away from a hotel and the fish and chips were excellent. Really enjoyed the ""Cinder sauce"". Will be back.",1
1325,I took my wife out for dinner at the Korea House Restaurant. Service was very good and the food tasted very good. It's on the expensive side. You'll spend 17-25 per entree and we were a tad disappointed with the fried dumplings. Overall it was a very good experience and we'd return.,1
1326,"Refreshing to find a great bar here! Met great expats. As well as some locals. All great to talk to! Love the Hendricks!!!! And , awesome Ipa on tap..... One of the best I've found.",1

The welcome you receive is fantastic and sets up what always follows.... A great social experience! I personally cannot wait to enjoy this bar more and more! A top place to visit!,1
1328,Tonight was my 4th time in Cafe Korea. Seated and ordered our drinks. Ten minutes after party of 12 came in. A lday staff asked me and my husband to moved to another table! Such rude!!!! We went out and will never go there again!!!,0
1329,"Great food, very well served. Only 2 problems is cash only and they don’t bring the good all st the same time.",1
1330,"I’ve always eaten here because I like the ambience of the restaurant. It looks way better than typical restaurant in most China town. I’ve also always loved eating Korean foods so no matter which restaurant I order it from I’m still gonna like it. However, the staff needs more training as they all seemed to be young student girls with no experience in customer service. Once you have your food on your table they don’t ask you anymore whether everything is okay or not. One time I had to call the attention of the waitress for 3 times and she still didn’t come to our table because they were busy (showed they were short of staff too and can’t handle busy shifts). I saw the manager (I assume she is) lowkey telling off the waitress when she didn’t know the name of the food she was serving. There were times too when the food order took so long to arrive on the table and not at the same time. They’ll bring one after the other! (Again, it showed slow service from the kitchen). Like I said I love Korean foods but the service in this restaurant needs improvement. Oh, i was surprised when i saw that they charge you for service charge when you don’t get the service you deserve to get anyway.",1
1331,"I think that for what we pay, Seoul Chako is quite good. The meats are well marinated and seasoned, and there is a good selection. The reason why I only give 3 stars is for 2 main reasons, the first being the service. Last time, we had to ask 4 times for our gril to be changed before it was changed (we waited more than 20 minutes). The restaurants wasn't event that busy when it happened. Also, it happened quite a few times that not all the items we ordered came out. The second reason is the most important I believe. Me and my friends asked for chocolate ice cream. When it came out, I took a spoonfull, and spit it right away; the ice cream tasted like shit. I belive it was expired. 
Would coma again, but will never order chocolate ice cream ever again.",0
1332,"Experienced very bad service there. Hardly anyone came to fry the hot plate and side dishes is the not so popular choices like radish and white cabbage. No kimchi at all.
For that price, we can have 2 big hotpot of Gamjatang and heavy bbq option.",0
1333,I can just give the warmest recommendation to come Cinder Bar whenever you are around Incheon/Songdo. Warren and Sam are without a doubt the best.,1
1334,"Perfect cocktails, perfect beers, perfect music and perfect people! They are the perfect cinder crew with Warren, Hanna, Jimmy, Mijin, Nicole and Sam.. There, I can make music requests and they also have live music! I love this bar xoxo",1
1335,"This was my first experience with Korean food, and I was excited to go since my friends hyped up Miss Korea to me the night before. I have heard of bulgogi and kimchi, and always wanted to try them, so I was looking forward to the trip.

Upon arrival, we were seated at a table for four people (with five of us). The grill also appeared to be broken. It took ten minutes of nervous whispering and attempting to flag down the waiting staff for us to be moved to a bigger table with a working grill.

The ordering felt rushed and we had to send away the waitress as we didn't feel ready, and when she came back we had to rush a decision out of a feeling of awkwardness. I was then told by a friend who had been here before that their kimchi is not authentic at all, and would be a disappointment, so I decided to forego it. The food itself took a really long time to arrive, with the first main arriving close to fifteen minutes before the last. I found the starter (sadly I forgot the name, it looks like a deep fried pancake folded in half over some filling) and my main (bulgogi chicken with veg and rice in a hot stone bowl) generally bland and even a tad sickening in taste. The only redeeming quality of the main was the meat, which was delicious, but scarce. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the beef bulgogi and beer marinated beef that we could grill ourselves. They were absolutely delicious, but too felt like very little meat for £6+ per plate.

As another review points out, the service is terrible. The waiting staff pay no attention to what goes around them (we had to raise our voice to borderline shouting in order to get their attention from a meter away), the two waitresses seem very timid and even scared. Another lady, who appears to be their manager, has a very hostile air about her, made no effort to seem welcoming when talking to us and berated the two girls in the plain view of customers. When they do appear, the waitresses would come to the table, take the utensils and stir the meat on the grill after seeing you do it, before walking off without a word? Empty plates were not taken away from the table through the meal and once again the staff had to be almost shouted to in order to tell them that we would like our bill.

Overall, I wasn't very impressed with the restaurant apart from the novelty of the grill, which I did enjoy. As far as I understand the food isn't very authentic, and isn't a great representation of quality of Korean food. The service is poor and I felt like I overpaid for the little food that I did eat. I told my friends I stopped eating because I had enough and wasn't hungry any more, whichever as true enough, but the cause of that was a lack of appetite, and not a full stomach. The only reason I can see myself coming back to Miss Korea is for the grill meats, and exclusively that.",0
1336,"I love that I can pick my own protein, seasonings, vegetables and starch, and a sauce and someone else cooks. What I don't like is that a small meal and I mean bordering on tiny cost me twelve dollars and some change. Yes it was super delicious. I had Korean Mariano's beef, with salt and garlic seasoning, zucchini, sprouts, mushrooms and snow peas with a pan Asian sauce on rice noodles. The combination was amazing. Regardless that I felt it was pricey I would go back again because it was really good.",0
1337,"BBQ'd meats were delicious (we had the squid and pork). Not rating this a 5 due to mediocre starters and lack of traditional banchan (all the small plates that typically come with a Korean meal). We were also asked if we wanted rice, which I found strange since that's expected with a traditional meal. Service was nice and expedient. Would still gladly return for the delicious flavor of the BBQ!",1
1338,"Cinder is an excellent meeting point for International travellers and residents alike. The beers are carefully selected, the food is excellent and the owner is attentive and engages his customers in conversations. Well worth a visit or two!",1
1339,"Has to be one of the best bars in Korea. Went there on my last night, wish i had found it earlier. Only went for a few drinks. Ended up staying all night. Staff a super friendly and atmosphere is unreal. Great mix of locals and people from all across the world. Amazing range of beer and other drinks.",1
1340,"Nice restaurant, waiter helpful in ordering, we ordered Hot Stone bowl with beef, vegetables and egg yolk this was lovely. Noodles with chicken in a sauce,I was disappointed noodles were nice but chicken was in breadcrumbs with sauce dribbled on top.. Not what I was expecting.Overall it was nice although not real Korean food.",0
1341,"This is one of the famous and always crowded touristy restaurants in Myeong-dong area. Good one to try different Galbi dishes. Done limitations exist like all in the table should order the same type of Galbi as there is only one pan per table.

Anyways a decent place to try Galbi in the famous shopping area of Myeong-dong.",1

1343,"The Cinder Bar is an excellent place to unwind after a hard day at the office, or just a fun place to spend a Saturday afternoon/night meeting new people. Awesome atmosphere, good people, good music, good times!!",1
1344,First of all let me say this is not the most authentic Korean food I have ever eaten but still the food was excellent. The menu though was disappointingly small. Me and my boyfriend got rolls to share and mains. Everything was top quality and tasted amazing. Portions are big enough and we even left food on our plates which we rarely do. Great value for money. The only thing I felt really bad about was that I left the wrong tips which was almost nothing. Other than that I would revisit definitely.,0
1345,"Cheapest korean bbq place I've seen in a while. You can to choose what kind of meats you order for different prices. $23.99 includes beef, beef ribs, pork, chicken, red sausage, salmon, fish fillets, and squid + the usual sides. If you want vegetables it's an extra $3. Also dessert options are limited and cost extra as well.

The food is decent once cooked and dipped into soya sauce. The quality however is not the best. Half the dishes were frozen when brought out and my husband had a hard time separating the pieces.",0
1346,"I was so excited when I walked in this restaurant that I'd eaten in before, it was like walking into a Japanese / Korean house. (Everyone thinks Japanese homes are like Zen Gardens,HA !) it was very cozy with many things everywhere, on the walls, on all the surfaces, on shelves, everywhere. So my thought was, ah new management, new cook. Alas, new does no mean better. This restaurant changes hands frequently, but seems never to rise above mediocre.
The owner-cook is very pleasant and capable, not sure how he'd handle a big rush with a complex order. But he was fine tonight.
The food was fine, just not really good, not special tasting.",1
1347,"We were excited to find Korean barbecue place in Edinburgh. It was super busy with no available tables on the moment we went, but waiter kindly asked us to wait for 10-15 minutes. Finally we got our table and happily ordered beef bbq set for two. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with lots of little additional dishes as in South Korea does, but one has to order for extra fee. Our bulgogi tasted well, but it wasn’t that authentic though. For me the highlight was kimchi, that tasted very different from packaged ones. Waiters were quick and polite, thumbs up for them. Also it felt a bit expensive for what you get. Oh, and bare in mind your clothes will be soaked with smelly smoke for days, as everyone is grilling it’s own meat and there are no smoke extractors, unfortunately.",0
1348,"I frequent a Korean joint that I absolutely LOVE near home, so when other patrons there mentioned the Golden Pig I had to make a point to stop in.  
Of course I'm comparing the 2 directly and this place was good but not nearly as good as Chongs. I ordered the exact same meal that I normally would: Bulgogi (marinated beef), veggie pancake & Bimbap (seaweed roll). 
The layers of flavors are good and if you've never had Korean food you really should change that.  The thing I missed here were the dipping sauces and different textures between fresh and cooked veggies served along with the Bulgogi that I'm used to. 
They clearly use the same seasonings but different cooking methods, the bulgogi seemed soft & soupy, as if it's prepared in a slow cooker. Flavor was good, just a really tender texture that I didn't expect. 
Golden Pig is a bit pricey in comparison at $54 for lunch where I'd normally pay $28 for the same order at my local joint.  I don't think I'll return, however you should at least try it. 
There are 2 tables and maybe 4 stools at the counter so be prepared to wait on a table or just order to go. One little Korean lady running the whole show,  so clean your own table, get your own drinks & silverware. Make yourself right at home.",0
1349,Came here with a friend who has lived in Korea and loves his Korean food. The restaurant is small and simply decorated. The food is very good and I certainly enjoyed all the side dishes as well as my main dish of rich and vegetable.,1
1350,"I had ordered online from Grubhub from this location in the past and it was really good. However, I had decided to come with a friend and eat at the restaurant and it was really disappointing. The staff was really nice but the food was pretty bad. I got the spicy bbq chicken meal and the chicken was really, really bad. The chicken tasted rancid. The price was okay for a few chicken wings, fries, and a drink but stay away from the spicy bbq sauce or if you do get it, get it on the side!",0
1351,I'm Korean and I came to Scotland for a holiday. this is easily the best Korean/Japanese restaurant in Edinburgh because they make real authentic Korean dishes. Made me feel like I was home in Korea hehe,1
1352,"We came across Yoogane a few times walking up and down the market area and decided to google it back at the hotel before visiting since we saw a lot of people queuing to go in, not realising that it was one of the must try places.
Please note that if you're looking for top service then this may not be the correct place for you. It's an establishment to enjoy the atmosphere of the galbi being cooked in front of you.
We waited for about 10/15 minutes and eventually got seated, table still being half cleaned as we sat down. Had a more older waitress waiting us, she tried her best to explain to us how it worked but communication barrier broke down a bit and not to her fault. We chose the standard chicken galbi and ordered additional rice to go with it.
Everything arrived pretty quick and was soon on the fire cooking, the service staff must rotate in the tables since we didn't really see the original waitress again. You're able to stir the ingredients yourself or the staff will come around periodically doing it. Either way, it can be fun so enjoy it.
Once cooked we were asked if we wanted the rice added in as well. Note, the rice is supposed to be added after you've eaten some of it and not added in straight when the cheese, chicken and veg is cooked. The new waiter that's come to our table asked if we wanted, but didn't advise that it should be done after. Only knowing after it was added, its meant to be cooked with the left overs to soak up the remaining flavours on the palate.

Overall a decent visit but a smelly one, was nice but would go back to eat it properly next time. Be prepared for your clothes to smell after so wear something that you're prepared to go without for the remaining trip.",1
1353,"Ordered take out so this review is in the food but daaaayyyyyuuuuuummmmmmmmmm brrruuuhhhhh I was against eating Korean fried chicken because I'm more of a Popeyes or bojangles person but my girlfriend insisted we eat there because she swears it amazing so to prove her wrong I went along with it but I was wrong. Babe if you're reading this you are correct this place is the shit I'm so happy I tried it. Definitely my new favorite fried chicken place. Garlic soy chicken wing on point. 

Edit: Second time coming here was not so good to be honest, it wasn't that busy but my food took a while and when I received it the wings I don't want to say it wasn't cooked because chicken inside was good but the outside was soggy and doughy. Consistency is huge for me so I just removed one star till I go a third time see what happens. Everyone has a off day can't blame them",0
1354,"Good food and quick service, the only thing to note is that they don't take card payments. There is a cash point nearby but it's worth knowing. I'd go back to try another dish from the menu. It's a 5 minute walk from Victoria station.",0
1355,"I have been to this bar twice and every time there were plenty of people, especially foreigners. The service is good and the quality of the products also.",1
1356,"Visited this restaurant a few weekends ago. The server asked if it was our first time, which it was. She was friendly and brought us our beverages quickly. We were confused after we went through the line, added our sauces, and handed our food over to be cooked. We didn't know if were were supposed to wait there or if it would be brought out to us. It was brought out to us as we walked back up unsure. The food was ok, but seemed pricey for how little we got. Also, yes I did pile my bowl high.",0
1357,"I'm a big fan of Korea food and I love the food here such as Bibimbub, Tokpoki and Kimchi-jikae. Also, BBQ is very delicious even though your hair and cloth will have permanent bbq smell.",1
1358,"Best Korean gookbob restaurant in town.  If you are familiar with gookbob style, a combination of soup and rice, you should love it.  This restaurant is not for typical Korean barbeque, so dont expect to have a BBQ party here.  Anyway, you can give it a try-!",0
1359,"Perfect bar to hangout with friends, have some good beers and good time! The barman, Warren, is always in a good mood! Defenitly a must go bar!",1

1361,"Never have I ever placed a 1 star review on Tripadvisor, nor walked out of a resturaunt so confused and angry.

Me and my partner went to this restaurant as our first BBQ experience. Small menu, so we tried to order a BBQ chicken dish for 2 people (23000 won) as well as another chicken rice dish (6000 won) as we were so hungry. Was told we could not order both dishes? We didnt understand why this was, so tried to clarify - and our waiter was so rude, treating us like we were stupid. We continually tried saying we wanted both, and was not given a clear explanation as to why we had to choose one or the other. Why is it that your resturaunt would not allow us to spend the extra money for one extra dish?

Also found it odd the treatment of other customers wanting to come in to the restaurant by the man at the front - not even a smile on his face, very abrupt.

Lack of service standards are clearly reflected in many reviews as we found out after exiting the resturaunt and searching it up online.

We ended up walking out without ordering anything, and found a better resturaunt with MUCH better service.",0
1362,"Decently good food. Sometimes hard to find parking in that area. Though there are about four designated free parking spots behind the store. More unique Korean food - mainly bring the big sizzling plate - which tastes great especially with cheese and noodle add on, but isn't very good value for money, as it is minimum two portions. So, for a sizzling plate, it is at least$20 and probably$25 after the add ons. This won't get two people full so you need to add another dish of some sort, bring the total up to well over $35 for what is supposed to be a cheap casual restaurant. Oh, and I didn't even include any drinks!",0
1363,"If you're in Muscat and crave some authentic Korean food then head right over without a doubt in mind. The banchan served at the beginning of the meal is not of a huge selection but it is sufficient and tasty. The vegetarian Japchea is juicy and full of flavor. We ordered Kimchi jeon, it comes in a number of small pancakes which were hot and yummy. For the main meal we tried their ever famous half and half fried chicken and the stir fried spicy squid. My only disappointment was they had no Ice Tea and no free after meal dessert which in my experience comes with every Korean restaurant.",0
1364,"The worst service ever, the grill and table were completely unclean. I was hesitant to try the sushi due to how unsanitary the place looked.",0
1365,"Went here and place was empty and group of 8 a little apprehensive. Order spirits, beer, bulgogi and everyone was so please we gave u TV a go. Really good food and we'll looked after, if your passing, give it a go!",1
1366,"Ehhh I don't know about this place. I honestly hate writing reviews like this but I have to be straight forward on what I think about this restaurant.

Here it goes.. This was the old takamatsu. I was one of the regulars then. I love korean bbq and been to a variety  all over AZ and Cali. It's one of my favorite foods to eat and I never get tired of it either. Bf and I wanted to check this place out since it was lunch time and we were around the area.

We walked in and was greeted. There were about 4 to 5 food servers on a slow week day. There was about 3 customers eating inside ant that's including us. All were just standing because its slow but we were serviced by all as well. Which was a little confusing because some would ask the same question about what we wanted on the menu. We told them several times we already ordered and got this...

We were served our food. The meats are very low quality, sauces they have wasn't great nor good either. They gave me msg plus salt on the side. Everything tasted plain. It's $14 a person for all you can eat. So who can complain right? It's cheap so therefore the quality of the food you're eating is what you paid for. That's why there's a saying you get what you paid for. The service was good but could be better because I feel like they dont communicate on which server should take care of which customer. There's also too many of them so I get it they're probably trying to keep busy and probably bored. Other than that I won't be coming back. Sorry to say this is the worst kbbq ever. Food was just horrible and I am just being honest here.

Better meat quality can improve this place a lot better and have some seafood selections it will catch more customers. Oh and get more sauces on the side not msg and salt please.",0
1367,Over priced for average food. Gave 2 stars because the food was decent but it was $14 for veggie lo mein and springs rolls. I should have just went to a restaurant,0
1368,This is not a nice restaurant. Their Ventilation system doesn't work . All the oily and Pungent smell make me and my friends sneeze nonstop. And because all the sneezing I can't even taste their food properly. They have the very worst service I've ever experienced in Seoul. Their horrible attitude and bad service that left me feeling like we couldn't leave there fast enough.,0
1369,"Update to my past review. 

Okay...it's rare but this place has improved ALOT! Great job to the management. It definitely took us by surprise. However, we did only have three people in our group and there wasn't a rush. 

We decided to give this place another go after realizing our intended restaurant was closed for the day. We had k7 and k10. Spicy pork bulgogi and boneless short rib cooked my the kitchen. The food were all prepared well and perfectly seasoned. My only concern was it did take awhile for our food to come out. Luckily we weren't that hungry. The service was great this round too. Tentative and helpful in explaining the menu. Water and side dishes refilled with ease. 

Second chances paid off after all!! I'm hoping and wishing they will stay consistent. We'll definitely be back again. 

Tip: Give this place a try if you don't mind walking out smelling like Korean BBQ goodness :). Large groups be ware of added gratuity still. 

-------------


This place was takamatsu...now Arirang
Don't bother going...

This place was not prepared for a party of five and up. The customer service here is horrendous. We waited for awhile until the grill was cleaned. That's understandable if it took 5 minutes as discussed but it actually took them 20 minutes to clean. We had to ask for plates, drinks, sauce bowls several times until our request was fulfilled. It's bothersome when something has been asked of several times and they don't care. We were neglected as soon as the food arrived. No water refill. We had to wave a waitress down so many times for the bill. They are disorganized and the food was mediocre. Other Korean establishments are better.

PS. Party of five and up, be prepared for 18% gratuity! The price for bad service...Le sigh. 

Thumbs down!",0
1370,"The girl who greeted us was kind. Then I had to figure out how it worked on my own. Then walked to the begin,explained the size bowl. Small is extremely small. Pricy for a small. Then load as much as I can in the tiny bowl. The people who toss your food to cook are rude,half fell off,who cares I'm just paying $11 for a tiny bowl. Then you just have to figure out what to do next. Do I wait?? Guess not. Go sit they will bring to you. Ok my food was great but I selected it so that was expected. Some things I didn't have in my selection were in my food??. Fiery hot peppers..no thanks. I'm probably not coming back. I'll stick with. YC's get more food for less and they guide you with manners.",0
1371,The food here is honestly amazing and I have been here twice with friends and family. I order Bbq items each time I go and the Spicy squid and chicken and pork are nice but the spicy chicken is slightly overpriced as you only get 2 slices. Sometimes it is hard to catch the attention of the staff but the people here are really friendly.,1
1372,"Amazing restaurant, the waiters were very nice and we're all very careful with my allergies to sesame telling me exactly what I could and couldn't eat, they also helped on how to use the barbaque at the start, the food was very nice and you get all the necessary vegetables and lettuce needed for the meat, lovely place overall, 10/10 would visit again",1
1373,"I have been coming to this bar since late 2015 and I must say that I am continually impressed by the motivation and innovation of the staff here. From a continually expanding drink menu, which will have you staring at the pages for hours, to the jazz nights and their trivia night, Cinder bar and its crew make every visit unique. As a long time customer it is hard to be unbiased but the only advice I can offer is that whether you want to just go out and meet some new people, prop up on a bar stool and down beers or sit at table and have some cocktails.. Cinder is the only way to go.",1
1374,"I think they have 2 stores in Myeongdong; we went to the one on the 1st floor, above LaLa Mart.

Went there twice during our trip (1st & last night) as we love the dakgalbi and personally I love the teppan fried rice (must add cheese!!)!!! They will come around to help with the meat tossing occasionally or you can cook it by yourself. Free flow of sides like kimchi & other pickles.

Would recommend to try if in Myeongdong area. Yumsssssssssssss",1
1375,"I used to like this restaurant until today. I've been to ""Miss Korea"" more than 5 times in the past 1 years, I like the food although it's a bit over-priced. Today me and my wife ordered 4 dishes, a ice cream and a coke, everything is ok until I have the bill, there're 2 more drinks on the bill(Strawberry milk shake& J2O papaya, totally 6 pounds) which we never ordered, in the meanwhile there's only one big empty cup on our table.

I asked waitress, she realized immediately before I told her what happened. She then went to modify bill and bring the correct bill back without a apology. She seems not very happy about we checked bill carefully and found out what they did to our bill. I asked some of my Chinese friend, they have the same experience of be given wrongly-calculated bill. I think they're doing this on purpose, because what they add into bills are drinks, which are their most profitable things in menu.

As people already mentioned before: they don't serve tap water. why? as far as I can tell, a big part of their profit are from drinks. if you have a tap water which is free, they earn nothing from their over-priced drink. eg: a Korean grape drink, in ""Miss Korea"" 2.5 quid, in 100 feet-away Chinese convenience store: 50p. Now maybe you can see the reason why they don't serve any tap water.

Avoid this restaurant. if you can't, be prepared that there won't be any tap water served. Carefully check your bill.

Pro: the food was ok.

Con: Serve no tap water, Add drinks which you never ordered to bill stealthily",0
1376,"Having just returned for South Korea I can say this place is a great traditional restaurant

The service was perfect and the food was delicious.

We had some Korean BBQ, kimchi and all the trimmings you would expect with Korean.

Even has Korean beers and soju (highly recommend to go with your food)",1
1377,"Service was great, food was great literally would change nothing about the food or service would definitely recommend :))",1
1378,"So I am. Big fan of authenticity:: the soup has really no flavor til you add things to it:: such as salt, kimchi, and a ton of green onions.. 
Also, the portion for what you pay: ex. Ox Tail Soup is $15.99 :: was expensive in my opinion.. And is super small:: not very filling so I recommend getting a extra side order of something so the cost is around$30.00 per person:: for that price I can get a all you can eat some where.. I recommend coming here for a Korean experience... But worth it..  ??.. Depends on the person:: I would open a spot up with the same soup:: offer bigger portions with less price and home made kimchi and probably would put this place out of business... Sorry but true..",0
1379,On my first visit to South Korea I stumble into this bar where I was greeted as if I was coming there for year leo was amazingly hospitable nice friendly Very engaging and I feel as if I have known him all my life I definitely made a lifelong friend and Leo Makhil the cook was also very nice and food was great definitely a must stop when visiting South Korea in each one in particular I hear great things about the OG cinder bar which on my next visit I will be attending Ask for Leo he is the best!!,1
1380,"Was in the mood for some ramen so my friend and I decided to try out the new Mo' Ramyun that opened across from Vaughn Mills. It looks very small on the outside but I'm pretty shocked at how spacious it is when we went in! 

It wasn't busy at all (probably 2 other tables), which is to be expected for a newer restaurant. I got there around 6 PM. The server was very quick to greet and seat us, which is a big plus. 

I opted for their most popular item, the Mo Ramyun! This is the perfect choice if you're looking to get ramen with a little bit of everything. I believe it came with pork belly, chicken, egg and some veggies. The server warned me that this may be a bit too spicy when I ordered it but the spice was very tolerable. Tbh it probably could've used some more spice... I guess it really depends on your spice tolerance.  

Now IT WAS GOOD, not gonna lie. But... I really don't think its worth the $15.95 price tag, hence the 3 stars. $12 maybe - but $15.95 is pushing it for literally a bowl of instant noodles with added meats and veggies that you can make yourself at home. 

We also ordered the ramyun chicken wings to share. It's super breaded, which I love! Its not the best chicken wings I've ever had but its still very tasty and a great appetizer to share with friends. 

Regardless of the price, I'd still recommend Mo' Ramyun to friends if they're really craving instant noodles and are too lazy to make their own ..and wouldn't mind spending. I'd probably still return, but I will try out other things on their menu. Hopefully it will be more worth the price tag!",0
1381,"If you look for quiet place I guess it is not the right place for you, since they have live music, smoking, speaking loudly (Korean and Chinese).

What impressed me a lot is waitress there she play as many role. She can be waitress, singer, instrument. When is the time, most of waitress will be on stage, sing, dance.....",1
1382,"This place takes FOREVER to bring out the order. 
Servers are really rude and they will speak back to whatever you say or ask. We ordered 3 soups to go and it took nearly 45minutes for us to get them.",0
1383,The bibimbap was not good. This place is for people who have never eaten good traditional Korean food. The bibimbap was missing so many ingredients. Bonchon also does not come with the meal.,0
1384,went on a saturday night with some friends. Comfortable interior. Owner was very friendly and chatted with us how he came to make his beer selections. He has a very nice selection of beers. The best I have seen in Korea up to this point. The food we had was very good. I will return.,1
1385,"The food was decent.

Our service was terrible. I say 'our' service because it's only fair to note that it really was one jackass, rude waiter who spoiled the meal for the entire group of us (20!).  The manager was nice and apologetic when I told her my opinion, and she said it was her fault - which is true, in a way - they should have had more staff available.  But she was nice enough.

Our waiter, hope you don't get him! Rude, short, threw food down, argued with us, cut us off, made the dinner and paying the check as difficult as possible. 

My review would have been one star if the manager hadn't been so apologetic and made me believe a lot of our experience was because of the server, not the establishment.",0
1386,Good service quality food. I've eaten Korean food all over the world including Korea and this place is really good. The chega is great and all the kimchi great with service to match.,1
1387,Really fun authentic bar near the Songdo business district. Friendly staff and good collection of beers and spirits. Frequent it often and it's always fun!,1
1388,"First, I want to warn you that there are two restaurants called ""Korea House"" in Seoul. Take care which ""Korea House"" entry on Trip Advisor you are looking at. I am writing about the restaurant with this phone number 82.2-2266-9101 and the web address: http://www.koreahouse.or.kr/eng/?en_skin=index.html.

That other ""Korea House"" listed within Trip Advisor has several reviews that I believe are for the restaurant we visited. The other Korea House specializes in Korean beef dishes and the menu looked very interesting, but we did not eat there. The staff was gracious dealing with our mistake and called us a taxi.

Overall, the meal, service and environment were wonderful. We arrived an hour late, and in the dark, but were welcomed with smiles from our hostess wearing a traditional Korean costume. We were lead through a large patio area where dances and other programs are conducted during the day. On the far side we ascended a set of rough stone steps and followed a cobble stone path to the building we would dine in. It was very impressive and the landscape lighting made it even more so.
There are several separate buildings and if you sign up for a court cuisine dinner, you will be seated in your own dinning room. My daughter in law was concerned about my back and knees and asked that we be seated at a table rather than eating laying on the floor. When our hostess slid the door back of our dinning room the table was low, but the space under the table was hollow, allowing us to sit normally on padded seats that had backs. Very comfortable!

The dinner is very similar to ordering from a ""tasting menu"" at a nice restaurant.
There are several courses depending on the meal you choose. We had the Eojin Jeongchan dinner. It is pricey, but you are paying for the experience as well as the gourmet food. Follow the link I provided above, click on ENGLISH, and look at Royal Cuisine to see the menu. All of it was delicious and the experience was fun. Our waitress, dressed in the traditional costume, spoke good English and was very helpful, attentive, and did not seem perturbed in the least we arrived an hour late.

I don't know when I will have an opportunity to return to Seoul, but the full experience of this place was worth the stop. If you time it better than we did, you can also attend a theater production following the meal. See the website for details.",1
1389,"My second visit just as good as the first. Friendly service, good prices, love the BBQ experience. Highly recommended",1
1390,"Third time's a charm!

Service has noticeably improved on busy nights.

Lettuce vanished from the menu... Sad day for ssambap.

Ordering is now efficiently done thru a paper form system so no more plates left behind (or language barrier with some of the staff)

Thanks for dropping by my previous reviews.",0
1391,I've been to authentic Korean BBQ restaurants in Vancouver and this one was nothing like it. The meat is nothing special and service was okay. I liked the food but for the price I did not have what I expected to have. They also have no Korean drinks and the offer ending at 10:30pm and the other one starting at 11pm is not clear and not client friendly. You will enjoy the sushi and having to cook your meat but not worth your money in my opinion.,0
1392,"”YOU GUYS ARE STUPID” THAT IS WHAT YOU SAID!!!!!
I had heard excellent things about this place but the experience I had today was the complete opposite!!! First of all, the one waitress at the place was absolutely rude, she had the worst scowl on her face and had kept pinning everything she did wrong on somebody who had little English skills as we had previously mentioned to the woman. She had ‘misheard’ one of the orders (which to me when she was taking the orders looked like she didn’t give a flying toss). When we explained she got the order wrong she gave us the dirtiest look and told us we were wrong and spent 30 minutes trying to get us to eat something we did not order and when we finally received what we had originally ordered it was once again not the right food! We had pointed specifically to braised chicken bulgogi with bbq sauce which we pointed at the photo which we revived a dish which we did not order. After finishing the food we received the bill and split it between 7 of us and 2 of the girls left shortly after. As soon as the girls had left the waitresses came over to tell us that they messed the bill up and it went from £78 to £85 which I must say we are 15 and some of us do not have a lot of money and would have helped if they could have told us before the girls had left. So overall I will not be re visiting and I do not recommend going there!!!",0
1393,"We visited Yoogane for lunch one Sunday. The staff who attended to us were very pleasant and helpful. If at all, they didn't speak English very much and perhaps that's why they may come across as unfriendly.
We had chicken and small octopus for 3, and 1 portion of fried rice. It turned out to be just nice for 3 hungry adults.",0
1394,One day we were the first customers in this restaurant and we found the owner/chef meticulously sorting through the bean sprouts to remove any that were not up to her expectations. We have been frequenting this restaurant since the early 90's and these owners have really brought the quality up. The seaweed salad is the best I have had anywhere. I love the bibim bob and the mandu guk and my husband always orders kimchi chigie even when he thinks he's trying something different the waiter comes and he orders his kimchi chigie. One of our favorite restaurants.,1
1395,"Once a month our social group tries a new ethnic cuisine. The Korea House is a good place to ""get your feet wet"". Very good service and everything we tried was good. The only thing I wished that the spicy dishes were a bit more hot. I probably should have took the initiative to ask. I give Korea House a great recommendation.",1
1396,Went last week and this place doesn't even sell sushi anymore!!!!!! how is it a sushi bar!!!,0
1397,"we were so exited when we saw the menu , we did order one Chinese one Korean dish but when we got home we got the wrong order and it wasn't even yummy , not sure if we will give a second chance :(",0
1398,"My husband and myself went this evening as a walk in;I assume it was busy with reservations as we were asked if we could be out by 8pm and this was just turned 7pm. No one really explained why. We ordered 1 starter which came very quickly as did the drinks. My main came 10 mins before my husbands but I assume as his was fried this was the reason for the delay. No one explained why. The food was very tasty, drinks a good variety and reasonably priced. Cannot really comment on staff as not a lot of interaction. After our mains we asked for the bill as it was 7:40 and did not look at desert/coffee menu. Would definitely come back but would reserve a table at a less busy time.",0
1399,"I've tried many different Korean BBQS. This one is probably in the less good range. Its not bad exactly but its abit bland. The marinade for the meats was all pretty similar. The quality of the meat was good though. The sushi was pretty good. The one thing that stood out form the other Korean BBQS are the takoyakis. I've never seen them in another AYCE place. That was a nice surprise although they but ketchup on them which was really weird. Appart from that the service was acceptable and relatively quick.
Honestly Sota right across the street is much better.",0
1400,"I remember Joons tasting much better back in the day. But now I have to write a review to let others know that their quality has gone downhill. We ordered the typical dak gal bee. You have the option for chicken or chicken seafood nssve yourself the $ and get the chicken.

The seafood is pathetic, some small mussels and squids and shrimps. The noodles are good and so is the sauce. However they limit how many noodles you can get (it's 1 noodle pack per pan). 

Can't write anything to take home about. If you're here to eat you know what you want.",0
1401,"We found this restaurant just by googling and we were very impressed! We ordered set D, which was a great combination of really fresh meat and was great if you're not sure what to order. The side dishes were delicious too, especially the salad and the marinated beansprouts, and the sauce was so tasty. We ordered rice as well, but it really wasn't necessary as the set itself is a very generous portion for 2 hungry full-grown men! I have, sadly, never been to Korea, but I have eaten at barbecue restaurants in the Korean district of Tokyo and this competes with the best of them. The staff were very attentive and friendly, and keen to recommend delicious, authentic combinations of meat and side dishes. All this for a very reasonable price - we'll definitely be back!",1
1402,Went with my husband and 13 year old son. It was a good pleasant atmosphere. Service a bit slow as low on waiting staff. Steak was very good. Ox tongue and belly pork was not pleasant. Chicken was average.,0
1403,My biggest complaint is that the rice is not fully cooked and it gave me stomach pain. The bulgagi was good. Both the kimchi and seafood pancakes are over priced and did not taste good. I probably would not wanna go back.,0
1404,"This place is quite fun actually! You cook your own food which is different and quite pleasant! Their deserts are good too the mango pudding was awesome! Their chicken and meat was really good too and the dragon eye sushi was really tasty! 

Down points: they brought the bills and the interac machine before we had finished eating our desserts in a way of saying get out already! And we also had to order a second time for food we never received the first time...",0
1405,"I'm not a fan of garlic, and yes I know Koreans love their garlic (sometimes they can mask it really well, like in their marinades or pork bone soup) just didn't expect the cream sauce in the corn cheese ramyun to be like Alfredo sauce with extra extra garlic. The wings were also dry and the sauces didn't help much.",0
1406,"I saw the reviews, but I thought I should give it a chance. I went here with my family, and we should have listened to the reviews. First, it's expensive. Second, they don't serve authentic korean food. To top it all of, the service is horrible. Orders were missing, and we asked some waiter for help and he said I'm not your waiter look for your waiter. The meat selection was horrible, and the meat didn't even taste good. I expected better quality or at least better service for the price they charge. Do yourself a favor and look for any other restaurant

TL;DR

Cons:
-meat selection
-service
-food quality
-taste

Pros:
-TBD",0
1407,"- Food is NOT AUTHENTIC
- Terrible service with just the one waiter.
- Not allowed tap water
- For the quality of food, price was extortionate.

1408,We enjoyed a pan of chicken and octopus galbi for us to share. There were sides you can eat and they’re readily available at the corner of the restaurant. We enjoyed our meal with beer and the night was awesome! I’m coming back to this place.,1
1409,"We thought we were going to a BBQ chicken spot, but it is authentic korean food. Great service, nice atmosphere, amazing food. A feast for the tongue with amazing flavor.",1
1410,"If you truly want to get a taste of what authentic Korean food taste like, I would not recommend Miss Korea.

Average food at the expensive prices. I praise for the menu tho as it has a good variety of choices between side dishes, chicken, seafood, beef etc. I believe the most proud dish of the restaurant of the BBQ, however I personally think the dish is over priced for the under seasoning meat, little proportion on the dish.

Nevertheless, I do recommend to order Tteokbokki ( Korean rice cake) and the rice dishes as they are quite delicious and easy to eat.",1
1411,"We had a reservation but turned out it wasn't needed. The food was great, overall good value, the service could've been a bit faster. The kimchi was a bit more sour than spicy and not as crunchy, but it's up to personal taste. I think they could serve kimchi as a complimentary sider to the bbq, as they would also in Korea. Some music would be nice.",1
1412,"Seoul Chako is one of these places I've been to many times, and liked less and less.
When I came to Montreal, I thought it was great, mainly because I never had Korean BBQ. 
It was a great place to grab dinner with friends, especially if they never really had Korean BBQ either. The food was on average acceptable, but not very authentic (the owners are Chinese). After a visit or two, I already knew to avoid certain meat cuts, and to stick to a few crowd favorites (and also that my clothes would smell of BBQ for days). 

One downside is the lack of vegetables. There's not much except mushrooms, bell pepper and zucchini. Another weakness is the service. They are usually understaffed, and it's difficult to get serviced sometimes. They also tend to bring incomplete orders or, at worst, to forget them altogether. As with other all you can eat places such as Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, it's safer to order everything you want to eat on the first order. Otherwise, I haven't had many bad experiences at Seoul Chako over the years, although I did find a dead ant in my mango jelly once (the staff promptly apologized and brought me a new one).

There are certainly more authentic and better quality Korean BBQ in town (e.g. Chez Hwang). But if you're looking for a loud, cheap-ish, straightforward place to eat a lot of meat, then I guess Seoul Chako is okay.",0
1413,"They pick up your food and not far from where is my table, just next to the entrance, there's a bin where the empty dishes go. The waiter throw the dishes instead of putting the dishes in the bin and that is so noisy for the ears. The noise seemed to be forever. The design of the table were nice and our waiter also.",0
1414,"We walked past this restaurant and were intrigued to see what the hype was because the restaurant was full.
We had to share the set meal so if you came with someone and you didn’t want to eat the food there you are screwed. So we had a set dinner for 4 people and chose the recommended dish with the kilo of cheese.
I have to say it’s very different. It was nice but very rich. I was stuffed. The food was ok.",1
1415,"Have wanted to try Korean BBQ for a while. This was brilliant we got a mixed meat platter for £20.00 each we received free top up sides and beer each.the meat was lovely and it was a really nice way to eat. Interestingly the more you ate the better it became and the more you wanted to keep eating. Would highly recommend as great value for money, very filling and a really nice experience.",1
1416,"I'm writing this review on my toilet that I almost destroyed in the last 7 hours. Let me put it this way, my stomach is made of steel and if your food can give me diarrhea, it means I'd never come again and tell all my friends not to go. 


I've been to Joons couple times 4 years ago and I'm finally back in the hood so hey let's try out! My boyfriend and I went there yesterday on our anniversary and ordered the table cooking thing with beef and octopus. It's $13.95 per portion and we added cheese and noodles. Service was slow. Requested to refill the side dishes and took them 15 mins to get the side dishes to my table. And the table cooking dish.. Overpriced. Portion was soooo little and whatever you add on you pay extra. Cabbage was undercooked. The flavour was great. What I did not expect is my stomach started acting up at 3am. So was my boyfriend's. Hence 1 star, will never go again. Don't even know if we could go on our road trip today just because of this meal.",0
1417,"We went as friends recommended it and Trip Advisor suggested it was good. No. Poor service, with incomplete meals and the quality of the food - some of it self-cooked at the table - was different. Expensive for what we had: £75 for four, with a drink each and one course.
Note the bill includes a 10% service charge.",1
1418,"average quality and taste, not wow but one of thoses places we kept going
back when we were shorts of idea where to eat and feel like having buffet style.",0
1419,"J'ai d청 dire que il n'est pas bon comme avant. Je suis y all챕e pour bcp de fois, mais cette fois, je me sens pas bon....",0
1420,"Amazing food! The whole bbq it yourself is great and a lot of fun when you visit with chatty friends!!! Had a great time!!!

Staff is nice, but the window is drafty! Def try not to sit at the window table during cold months....doesn't spoil the food, though!! :D",1
1421,I love this place and remind me a BBQ place in Daegu that I used to go to. The meat choices are great and we had a lot of fun cooking and it’s a good chat. Waiter was so kind to offer extra salad if we needed more. Side salads taste great. Will recommend.,1
1422,"The only reason why I'm giving Seoul Chako 3 stars is because their late-night AYCE deal gets you a lot of food for what you pay. The quality of the meat (especially the chicken) is subpar, but it will definitely leave you full if you come on an empty stomach. There is also quite a variety of fried small plates (we got the fried scallops, potstickers, potato croquettes, and spring rolls), which is really odd for a KBBQ place, but you can't really expect much from restaurant that doesn't have Korean ownership (hint, it's Chinese-owned). Normally, I wouldn't go here or even eat Korean barbecue in Montr챕al since it's pretty abysmal, but it's good if you're in a group, have the late-night munchies, and want unlimited ice cream to go along with it, I guess.",0
1423,"Our first visit and we were not disappointed! Lovely selection of foods to choose from, staff friendly and helpful. We ordered a sharing platter with a few starters too. Cooked our combo meats ourself which was different. Lovely food and enjoyable experience for Mothers Day",1
1424,"The Korean BBQ, our 1st tasing of Korean food - it was amazing, great theater of cooking your own meat on the BBQ in your table...
Well recommended .... and cheap as chips, we were very surprised at the cost..",1
1425,"This all you can eat BBQ is actually quite good. I might have rated the food a 4 star but the service was lacking. 

We came on a Friday afternoon during the holiday season. It's knowingly a busy time of year but the server did not come by to check on us even once. Water glasses were so tiny and don't expect frequent refills. I kept trying to flag him down for more napkins but eventually gave up. 

Highlights of the meal were the beef, beef ribs, chicken, salmon and white fish. The side dishes were amazing especially the kimchi (best I've had in a while), the radish (so crunchy and refreshing) and the tofu. Lamb is ok, don't expect much. The sausage and squid were weird. The shrimp are good if you don't mind the extra work and mess peeling them (and ripping off the heads yourself...gross).

All things considered I definitely would come back but not during peak hours.",0
1426,"me and my wife visit Birmingham to shop at the Korean restaurant in Selly Oak then like to have a meal out somewhere. we found this place through tripadvisor. First time we went all seemed ok a little expensive for what is kimbab cheonguk meals but barring that food was ok. Went again today and food was of average quality and prices for the dishes seemed more expensive. we ordered food and drinks including a seafood pancake which was way too small also the portions of bibbimbap were too small even my son (10 years old) complained of being still hungry after the meal. Biggest shock was getting the bill 3 pounds for water and 2 pounds for a glass of warm sprite that had been served out of a 2 litre bottle from the supermarket.
Seriously!!! having lived and worked in Korea for 6 years I know that you will never attain the same service standards as there, but saying that, charging for water in a Korean restaurant......
As a lover of Korean food I wont be going again. Sorry!!!",0
1427,I guess I should of listened to the reviews but decided to give it a shot anyways since it was the closest Korean BBQ spot to me. Our raw meat dishes for BBQ took an hour to come out and even longer to place an order. No ventilation so the smoke from the grill was fogging up the whole restaurant.,0
1428,"Disappointment !! After hearing so many people hyping about this restaurant, I decided to try it out. 
1.) no parking
2.) the chicken in our noodle tasted like they cooked last week and reheated (awful)
3.) overpriced, you have to add many toppings because the one pan doesn't come with anything. Each topping costs double because it's for 2 people and we didn't even get that much food.
4.) the restaurant is pretty dead, when me and my husband walked inside, there was zero customers inside on a weekend night during dinner time !!
5.) their washrooms are in the basement with very very very steep stairs. Hope you fix that before a lawsuit comes one day.",0
1429,"1st time trying a Korean BBQ other than Gens and I sure was disappointed. Athought price was cheaper, comes with less options and a different taste. Weird smell too when we first arrived and don't even get me started on our waitress. She look suprised when we asked here to change our grill. She got our order wrong as well. Overall, save your money and time and go elsewhere!",0
1430,"Food was great but our server was terrible. Went with a friend and it was both of our first time, the server made no effort to explain anything or ask if we needed anything even once during the entire meal. No offers for refills until we were done eating then dissapeared to behind the bar for another 20minutes before asking if we needed boxes. 

I would avoid this location like the plague.",0
1431,"Horrible food, worse service.  Nasty, you can see nasty in the kitchen.  Not good Korean.  GO TO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!",0
1432,"Highly recommended for first timers in Myeongdong. Before you jump in your night shopping exercises, make sure to load some calories at this resto. There's six of us and we ordered different dishes from their menu. My, everything we ordered is worth every won we paid. Side dishes are refillable too! Serving sizes are for sharing so if you're in a group you can budget between KRW10,000-15,000 each for a hearty meal. =)",1
1433,"We found ourselves in Miss Korea during the Sunday Chinese celebrations of the New Year (Horse). The food was good enough for us to eat it all however, not memorable. This maybe due to our love of Vietnamese food and expected more flavors, rather than Miss Korea's food itself.",1

1435,From the moment you walk through the door you are among friends. The owner is the most hospitable I have ever met and the cocktails are very well done. Limited food menu but also tasty.

1436,"What a find the Cinder Bar is! Amid the high rise buildings stuffed with expensive restaurants, massage places, doctor's offices and just about everything else in this city there is a much better option. The Cinder Bar is located on the ground level at the last building on the left side of the road just before the bridge as you leave Incheon for the airport. Warren and his new partner Sam have crafted this cozy establishment into a welcoming, warm and friendly place to have a nice meal and a brew or two. If you are in the mood, they also have a superior selection of single malt whiskeys. The prices are the best you will find in Incheon and the atmosphere is unmatched. The food is excellent as well. This is a family affair and Warren's wife is the establishment's cook. Of particular note is the new hamburger offered which is a new collaboration between Warren and ""The Flying Chef"". It's easily the best burger in town. Should you decide to give the Cinder Bar a try I can guarantee you will have a new favorite hangout on your list.",1
1437,"Cinder Bar is the best place in Songdo to chill out, meet new people, and enjoy some quality international beers. Oh wait, did I mention they also make the best burger in town?!

Cinder is run by absolute legend Warren, along with his mate Sam. These guys are hard-working, honest Kiwi blokes who always put their customers first. Warren even arranged free tickets to the baseball for me!

I’ve spent the past 6 months living in Songdo and visiting this bar on a semi-frequent basis. When I moved here I didn’t know anybody. Now I’m leaving Korea and most of the people I know have all been Cinder Bar contacts through Warren.

They show the baseball, rugby and many other sports, not to mention live bands and quiz nights. This place has all the hallmarks of a western style bar, but with a genuine Korean welcome.

Highly recommend you pay a visit any day of the week - oh and say hi to Warren and Sam for me!

Keep up the good work lads!",1
1438,If I could give this place no stars I absolutely would I'll keep it short and sweet we walked in and it was super dirty and dirt on the floor dirt on the table and the host did not come up and greet us until maybe 4 or 5 minutes later after we have been told by someone because we got tired of waiting to go back to the front and wait then the service the waitress was absolutely horrid had no enthusiasm act like she didn't even want to be there just kind of shrugged It Off and especially Being our first time there and we told her this then while we were waiting we seen a big cockroach crawling on the back of the couch that kind of did it for it was just a really bad experience if I could give this place 0 Stars I would never going back again and I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.,0
1439,"I'm a huge fan of Korean food and have been in too many Korean restaurants to count in many cities (Dublin, Tokyo, Osaka, Austria, London, Manchester, Seoul etc..), and this one is a definite 5 star. It was very authentic, we were also the only two non-Korean people in the entire restaurant which was full and booked out for the night, which must mean that this place is the real deal!

We ordered the Kimchi pancake and tofu bibimbap, both of which tasted just like in Korea, I savoured every bite! Not all Korean restaurants outside Korea seem to give the complimentary starters, but Korean BBQ does, which was great.

The prices were standard, each main ranging around £10-12. The service was efficient and good, no complaints.

A word of warning, this place is extremely popular, even on weekdays. We came on a Saturday to find it booked out so I made a reservation the following Monday online, which was ok. While we were there, the place was a full house and the waitress was turning down those without reservations as it was booked out until around 8:30pm.

The online booking is easy and quick, it fills up fast. I booked two days in advance for a Monday night, and the latest available was 6:30pm, with nothing available any later. So I advise booking quite a bit in advance or be ready to eat either early or late, as the 7-9pm times seem to get taken fast as the restaurant is small and seems to be very popular with Koreans in Edinburgh as well as tourists and locals.",1
1440,"If you are staying in Songdo, this place should be on your ""to do list"". The owner, Warren, is a really nice person that will be glad to welcome you. Drinks and food are really good. Enjoying a chat with international people around a beer is always a pleasure...",1
1441,"This is the best authentic Korean food in Boulder, with a unique and fun atmosphere. Don't let the strip mall fool you- it's super clean, delicious food. Family owned business and you can tell how much pride goes into everything. Be sure to kimchi pancake app, bulgogi and bibmap. Great for lunch and dinner.",1
1442,"Guess I can't beat the Korean out of me...'cuz every once in a while, I get this serious cravings for Jjajangmyeon! Well, that's something that hit me since mid-week, so I had to run to Choi's Korea to put this cravings to rest.

Well, all I can say is YUM!!! Their Jjajangmyeon was Amazing...with a generous mix of minced pork and veggies, and a ton of thick, juicy noodles! Can't even tell you how much I love this DEE-lish dish. It's actually such a popular K dish, there's this quirky movie (Castaway on the Moon, 2009) about it in Korea lol!

Anyway, Jjajangmyeon aside, I also had another one of my faves, the Tangsuyuk, a sweet and tangy fried pork dish...and again, YUM!! The version here is super crunchy too. 

All I can say is, if you haven't yet tried Jjajangmyeon and Tangsuyuk, you're missing out. Highly recommended!!!

As for the restaurant itself, it did its usual thing. Super comfy dig, with fast 'n friendly service, and great K-pop music. What's not to like?",0

8:55ish - Having received and eaten their food, the family leave.
9:10 - my table's first starter appears.",0

1446,"I just arrived from LA and was eating here with my family. To be honest, everything was enjoyable from side dishes to soup. However, the quality of rice was very disappointing. It wasn't mushy or too dry but I just couldn't keep eating it even with the soup. I'm a big rice fan so rice is an essential dining experience for me. 

All Korean restaurant is more expensive than in LA.

With the amount of money we pay to eat here or just costumers in general, hope you guys serve better rice in future!",0
1447,This was my third visit. I have nothing negative to say. The restaurant doesn’t look much from outside but once your inside the number of Asian people who were dining speaks for itself. It is very busy and booking is essential. The food is amazing. Everything tastes different. Even the free salad. I would recommend this restaurant 100%,1
1448,There are not a lot of Korean bbq option in the area. Don't expect too much from here. Just a typical place. Decent food decent service and honesty they do need to work on the cleaning the table properly.,0
1449,"As a Korean person who has tried Korean food all over the world, this restaurant is definitely at the bottom of my list. We ordered 5 different menu items, 4 of them being popular Korean dishes, and none of them were made properly. The jjangmyeon and kampoongee flavors were off. The jjangjangmyeon tasted like it was made from the instant packages, and the kampoongee tasted heavily like fish. In addition, the jampong had an excessive amount of red pepper flakes. Although this dish may not be Korean, the agedashi had TOO much batter. There was more batter than actual tofu. That's my mistake for getting that at a Korean restaurant. 

I'm shocked that this place had 4 stars. Sometimes I shouldn't trust Yelp. Never coming back here. Ever. Not worth the $90 we paid. I wouldn't even eat here if someone offered to treat me. 

Moreover, the waiter did not know what he was doing. He had us use the credit card machine, which he's supposed to do. 

Maybe the cook was having an off day. Who knows. Try at your own risk. This is just the experience I had.",0
1450,"The price is fair - but Chakos does have better quality.
The slices here for meat are very thin and they do tend to break easily.

The service is average - waitresses running back & forth looking harassed but you still don't get your Coke until 10 minutes after.

However, for the $ - can't really complain for AYCE. 

PS.  There's also a night owl if you can't make it for lunch or dinner is too expensive.",0
1451,"Came here at 11:30 am first, I just couldn't handle the smell. And asked to use the grill for all you can eat. Apparently they don't do all you can eat around that time. I'm disappointed",0

1453,"A lovely cozy bar. They made me some amazing fish sliders and I washed it down with the best gin and tonics I have ever tasted. I was there on business by myself but I left the Cinder Bar with some excellent new friends. The music selection was great and they even have live music from time to time. To Hanna, Warren and the Cinder crew, keep doing what you are doing.. It works.",1
1454,The place was busy but by the time we left it was virtually empty. This was due to the fact that everything took forever lunchtime. The hostess ended up being our waitress for the evening after noticing we were ignored over and over. We actually had one that did take our order but then never to be seen again. Due to this we constantly had empty glasses with spicy dishes which are not a good pairing. The food was simply ok. All of us at the table were disappointed and vowed not to come back for multiple reasons.,0
1455,"After a colleague recommmeded this restaurant we decided to chance our luck with a last minute booking for seven of us.
The staff were very friendly and accommodating and fitted us in.
At our table we opted for a couple of mixed meat cook at table bbq dishes and all the meat was great! This was more than enough for four of us. The other three opted for their own dishes which also looked very appetising!
Great little find and I’m sure I’ll be back!",1
1456,"This place is hard to discover by chance but if you're lucky enough to walk past it you shouldn't hesitate to come in! We had quite a classic selection of pork belly and chilli marinated pork - both delicious - and on the side we tried a kimchi pancake. The meal comes with traditional vegetable sides/appetizers, too, which make you feel like you're really splurging on yourself even when your meal isn't that expensive!

We'll definitely be back.",1
1457,"Decor is OK but that's not what we come for - prices are reasonable for the basic buffet but don't let them up sell you to the second pricier option. Service is good your raw meats come to the table quickly. The kimchee is their low point - it looks old and stale. I am a big meat eater with a greater appetite. 

On a previous visit, I noticed they seemed to get upset when I ordered too much meat but I persisted and left a large tip which they seemed happy with. 

On another visit, I ordered a lot and noted they are ingenious when it comes to making you order less and try to have you leave early. They had their staff sit at the next table where they started talking loud and laugh equally as loud. I got angry and continued eating, left no tip and didn't come back for a good 8 months.  Leave it to our Chinese to dream up these tactics. Places like these don't last.

Later in the year I returned and was happy they had changed owners. Gone are the boisterous employees who tried to make my experience unnerving. Go and try them.",0
1458,"I went to Joon's after reading the rave reviews. It's the only place I've found so far that also serves Dak Gal Bee in similar fashion to the way it's prepared in Korea. 
The food was fantastic, the service could have been better. We had to ask for water more than once, and the waitress had trouble understanding our order because English wasn't her first language. Then again, I guess you can't expect it ALL at an authentic Korean restaurant in Koreatown. 
My only disappointment was that they wouldn't mix the rice in with the chicken, the way it's supposed to be! It could also be because the waitress couldn't understand me.",0
1459,"Been here a few times and I really love this place! I go with a different group every time and everyone always enjoy their meal. Of course I always order the dakgalbi which is what Joons is known for! I've ordered either the chicken or beef option and both were delicious. I always add in cheese, rice cake and ramen noodles. The portion may seem small at first but towards the end me and my friends/family always struggle with finishing it. I've tried the steam dumplings a few times and it was amazing too. My mouth is watering just remembering my last meal at Joons!

I find it kind of odd that you have to order at least 2 portions of the dakgalbi but in the menu they give the price for just 1 portion. I recommended Joons to a friend and she told me she didn't realize she had to order 2 so she was super confused when she got her bill! I must imagine they get quite a bit of confused customers at the check-out. 

Service is alright, nothing beyond my expectations really. 3 stars because the fruit flies ...super annoying - especially during the summer :( But overall I would recommend this place if you are down to try something new ...and want to consume a loooooot of carbs haha.",0
1460,the food is ok for korean standard. the place is nice and accommodating. atmosphere is cheerful and waiters know a little english. which helps alot... serving size is ok we are 4 people and ordered 3 serving and it was enough for us..,1
1461,"My bf really wanted some Korean BBQ. I was a little skeptical about coming here and sad to say, it did not meet my expectations at all. I've definitely experienced better. 
To me the service wasn't the greatest. I understand that it can get pretty hectic when it is busy. But I've been to places that were just as busy or even busier. Our waiter did not even ask to see if this was our first time or to see if we knew how things worked. I've been to a Korean BBQ before but did not have to order by writing on a piece of paper. If I had not asked, we would have been sitting there for forever without anything. 
We both felt that the cleanliness wasn't the greatest. They could definitely improve on that. 
There was a lot of selections on the menu. Personally, the sushi was not good to me. Well the California roll was decent *shrugs*. The quality of meat was not the best to me. My bf thought the short rib was good, but I have had better. The pork belly was ok. I did like the spicy sausage and my bf liked the regular sausage. My bf and I were pleased with the ice cream though. Sooo it wasn't all bad. 
Sad to say that this was my bf's first time having Korean BBQ. Better luck next time!
I would not recommend this place. But with good company, why not?",0
1462,"I popped in here with friends for an evening meal. The building and interior were shabby, the staff were friendly but very slow and not very attentive. The food was of quite bad quality for the price, i had a chicken dish which was very salty, the plus side is that it was BYO. I will not be returning in a hurry.",0
1463,Best bar ever!! Always very nice!! Many internationals!! Cloud cloud cloud!!!!! The stuff and it is definitely the nicestplay too hang out after a day in university or at work nice :),1
1464,"I went here because it was close by and based on some of the reviews, I thought it would be worth a shot.  The Dak Gal Bee was okay at best and really not that satisfying.  The place is very casual and the service is okay.  All in all it wasn't very memorable and it doesn't really make me want to go back.",0
1465,"Great to know I might have HEPATITIS A
Never coming back.
I ate here two weeks ago and read the article too late, I work in food service myself and had no idea I might be putting my customers at risk and it's too late for me to get the shot, getting tested tomorrow. Awful.",0
1466,We booked this restaurant for 5 people four weeks ago. We reconfirmed our reservation two days before as we were travelling 60 miles into London to meet friends for supper. We arrived on time to be informed yes they had our reservation but they had no tables available. We would have to wait standing for maybe twenty minutes and then he could squeeze five of us onto a table for four. Said he was sorry and they just overbooked tables. This was said matter of factly -it would appear to be their normal practice. No free drink offered if we chose to wait. We left and found a good restaurant nearby. The front of house staff couldn’t have cared less. With such an indifferent cavalier attitude to customers you have to wonder what happens in their kitchen. Avoid at all costs.,0
1467,"Visited here on a Saturday night as a pre-theatre meal, ideal location as across the road from the Victoria Apollo. It doesn't look much but don't be fooled. We booked for 5pm, when they open and for first 15mins we were the only ones there but it soon started to fill up so booking is a must. The waiter was attentive & helpful but not intrusive, recommending dishes etc. The food was lovely and very tasty and it was very filling. I thought the prices were reasonable, 2 starters, 2 main courses, 3 sides, 2 puddings, large glass of wine, coke & bottle of water was £55 inc service charge. We will definitely be returning so sample more of the menu. Real gem of a place!!",0
1468,"No side dishes, and the price is much higher compare to other Korean place with similar quality.... won't come back.  

Rice is not the short grain rice nor the usual purple rice from other Korean places.....",0
1469,"Nice places and good food. We had the BBQ with 5 different kinds of meat, so we did most of the cooking ourselves as the meat was served raw and the table had a grill set into it. Vegetables, rice and sauces completed the meal. Great fun and very social way of dining.
Staff were young and maybe not too trained, but all charming and helpful.",1
1470,"I think this place is great! The atmosphere is very relaxed, thr waitresses are great very smiley and understanding. The food was great however... It was pretty expensive",1
1471,"I watched the super bowl last February here. Saved me the trip to Itaewon but this time around I am going to Itaewon to meet friends to see the big game. Otherwise I would come back here. The drinks were great, the food were great, the game so so. all in all a great place and I am planning to return soon.

1472,"Had a mixed seafood bibimbap and if you havent tried one they should definitely be experienced, served with several vegetables and rice in a hot, heavy dish, mix it all together for a great tasty meal",0
1473,"Overcast, Light drizzle.  Seafood Sujebi($8.95)

T&T closing shop near 10 pm.  
Alternative Food solution needed.
Jang Uh Plus 11 pm close.  
Decision finalized.

Banchans served at time of 1st Main hitting the table???
That Main took extended period of time as subsequent dishes followed.
Banchan wait-time was excruciating.  The question is why the wait?

Seafood Pancake..............
Chicken Bulgogi...
Chicken Teriyaki..............................
Cat Fish Sujebi...
Seafood Sujebi.

Family run meant patience is required.  Dishes come one after another.
The 6 dishes were served in 3 to 4 burst as indicated above.
The ideal situation would be eating with Family and sharing all dishes.
Unfortunately we are not Family, once again I chugged my Meal to compensate.

Seafood Sujebi($8.95)
               --------
I saw it under the Noodles section and just went with it, whatever it might be.  It happens to be a form of Handtorn Dough Flakes.  Nice density that give it the right bite.  Every Flake was unique like a snowflake.  

The Seafood was the Korean-style miniature Seafood bites commonly found.  Broth had more DEPTH than Beef Broth.  I might have tasted Shellfish in the Broth.  Sodium from the Kelp in the Broth?
               --------
Can Pop($1.00) or Cold Tea/Water(Free)",0
1474,"The Cinder Bar is a fantastic place to stop and make some new friends. Warren is the owner. Chances are he will personally greet you and make you feel like a long lost friend. The patrons are a great mix of local and westerners, very friendly. He has all the liquid refreshments you could hope for and a satisfying menu. I had a shrimp platter that was delicious. Aircrew are always welcome. Give it a try.",1
1475,"I'd never had Korean food before so I tried the Katsu curry which I've had at Japanese restaurants & really enjoyed so I had a basis for comparison. It was very different but equally tasty, coming with noodles instead of rice and a much tarter and thinner sauce. The green tea ice-cream was also very nice. Service a little slow, although if you intend to make a whole evening of it then that's not really a problem. Small restaurant, I'd advise booking as it's clearly popular at the weekends. I'd go again.",0
1476,Loved sitting on the floor and experiencing real Korean food. There was too much food. Neither my husband nor I could eat everything.,1
1477,"I would rate 0 star if I can. I thing they are using expired chicken. I ordered original and soy garlic chicken. Both have a very strange taste. I even found some feather on the chicken wings. I was the only customer in the store and it took 20mins to get two items ready. No doubt why the business is gloomy here. If u are reading this, you are luckier then me cuz you don't have to go through this sht experience and dump your food feeling guilty.",0
1478,I ordered food at 2:15 for delivery at 4:00 and was told that it would be 10 minutes late due to them not being able to find a driver. I called again at 4:03 and they said that the driver was on the way. I called the restaurant back and they had no updates on the delivery and explained that grub hub was responsible. I got an email from the driver at 4:23 and I called her and asked her where she was. She proceeded to lie and said that she called me and had already left my location. I was standing outside since 4:07 and did not see her or receive a phone call. I never received my food and I won't be ordering from them again. They need to fix their wonky partnership with grub hub for deliveries because it's obviously not working.,0
1479,"This is the restaurant equivalent of smoking DMT. You do it once and appreciate the experience and then never do it again because you fear for your mental health. I felt really wierd being there as its like supporting the North Korean Government who didn't get this well known by being happy fluffy hippies. The waitresses are cold and unsmiling (only my male mates were too impressed by them to tell. Hand picked apparently...). After half an hour of kimchi and incredibly expensive beer, they launched into this colourful, whirling, screeching show with ""happy"" smiling faces for the best part of an hour before going back to being grim and austere again. The place has the weirdest vibe of anywhere I've ever been. There wasn't much after dinner banter. I think we were all in a little shock. Like I said, it was a great experience and I'm glad I went but wow. Would I go back? Maybe just once...",1
1480,"Hannah and Warren are doing a great job building upon what Luke and his team started. There's always a warm welcome and good mixed company. The interesting range of drinks available traverse the globe too, from serving Korea's Maxx, new Zealand beers and decent Scotch whiskey to Manhattans and Warrens' signature cocktails... and now you can enjoy tasty food there too. Would I recommend a visit? Definitely, from meeting people in the community and watching a rugby match to having a quiet drink, this bar has it all... and the playlist pleases too! Probably why it's been our local for over a year.",1
1481,"I've been going there for such a looong time now so when they first started, they were the first one to really make korean BBQ famous here in montreal. It's always a nice place to go with a huge group and to just introduce korean BBQ to newbies. When you become more familiar with the place, you become less amazed and start to pick up on the bad aspect of the resto. The customer service is reallyyy poor: waiters ignoring you or your order, they are even rude at times, the long wait time for your order, even worse, sometimes they forget some of the dishes you ordered and its only after you've eaten everything else that you realise that they forgot 2-3 plates. Once, my group of friends and I felt discriminated (we were a group of black people) because all of a sudden when we asked for the bill, instead of our waiter it was the manager who came himself, took a good look at each of us, then gave us our bill. We felt that the service was sooo bad that we decided to not give much tip, but then the manager argued that for a big group like us we should give more tip... We were FLA-BBER--GAST! It was the last time I went there..",0
1482,"Really good food and service . We went for one of the set meals very nice photo enclosed , they did seem to try and rush us at one point but we hadn't booked. They didn't become over bearing .",0
1483,"This whole series of restaurants serve as nothing but a cash collector for the NK government. If you don't mind that...

Get the dog stew, it was pretty good. In fact all the food was pretty good. It's expensive for PP but then again you are paying for the Hennesey drinking habits of an entire country's plutocracy.",1
1484,"I called the store to place a dine in order to for kalbi hoping by the time I get there, It will be ready in 5-10 minutes upon arrival. That was at 7:51pm For the call an when we arrived to the store an sat down, that was approximately 7:57pm. I told the waitress we had a order placed over the phone to dine in an she said no problem let me check if it's ready but never came back. Waitress never asked us what to drink or anything! I was pretty shocked! Another server stopped by an handed us the side dishes and walked away. At that moment, I didn't know who was my server at this point. At 8:13 a waitress passed by we asked if we can get water. She then went to the back an served us the water shortly after that. Now, 8:17 the food comes out. I was mind blown. The meat was not sizzling off the tray. Meat was cold an onions was not grilled. Now keep in mind I've been coming to this place before the new owner an new name. That entree is normally $25 in cost an has a portion to eat for two! The plate I received today was tiny for a child to eat, seriously. I asked to speak to the manager to the waitress an she brought him out. He ask what was wrong with the plate? I said honestly I called to order the food to have it ready by the time I get there. I was not expecting it to be ready as I arrived but did not expect my food to come out almost 20 min either. Plate was not hot, meat was definitely cold. An the manager looked at me with no intentions of apologizing. But he did have a excuse stating originally the cooks placed it in a to go box, and transferred it back onto a plate. So my question to him was, so my food was out while we was sitting an waiting the entire time? He said to me that's correct! Ooookkkk an I asked so what are you going to do about this an he said well I can remake it? That's not the answered I wanted, I was expecting an apology but yet never got it. I looked at him an was in complete shock on how he did not resolve the problem an told him I would not pay for the food nor service. He said ok an yet still never apologized an I asked if I can speak to the owner or get his contact number. He told me he was the owner. Funny because I went there a month ago an another gentlemen older told me the same thing which he was more positive in the store and checked on every table to make sure everyone was satisfied. So he was not the only owner an told him I wanted to talk to him. He refused to give me the contact an I told him flat out.... guess you are going to receive a yelp review by me! New name, and new owner.... I would never recommend anyone to eat at this place. The servers are all new with no serving experience, just like the owner!

Funny how you can you can tell me you check the cameras an reviewed my comments but you can apologize  now but not in person? Sure you can say we ate 75% of the food as well when you have only 13 pieces of beef on the plate an I was accompanied with my lady. We can agree to disagree on the time the food came out on upon arrival although still the service you and servers gave us was terrible! Btw here is an image of the food from your competitor down the street from you, who served us Bulgogi. We left your company to eat at Gogi ( Better Food & Better Service) same night.",0
1485,"Ate at this restaurant with my daughter, the kimchi rice was delicious , but of course very filling and way too much for only two people. There are many to choose from and the ingredients are cooked right in front of you. Make sure you come with a big appetite, a must try when in Seapul of craving for Kimchi roce. The place was packer and there a hige line. Prices are average.",1
1486,"Having read some of the reviews, we were quite anxious about eating at Miss Korea, but we needn't have been. The service was thoughtful and help was offered but not pushed. The friends we went with had been several times before. I really enjoyed the dish I had with eel, as did one of our friends. My partner had a beef dish and the other friend had tofu. The kimchi and other side dish were very spicy but delicious and gave us something to nibble before our main dishes arrived. Drinks were good too - I had a soya drink, one friend had beer and the two men shared a spirit which, whilst good at the time had rather an unfortunate hangover as an after effect. Probably best avoided! We were not hustled or harassed and were able to enjoy a very happy evening chatting and enjoying good food. We'll definitely return and hope to try some of the other dishes next time. Thank you miss Korea.",1
1487,"Quality has gone down hill. Last three times I have visited, I noticed that Soup stock is water down and did not have that rich beef flavor as before and the kimchi has also changed. 

I don't know if there was a change of ownership or change in cooks, but definitely their quality has gone downhill!!!",0

We’ve been coming here for over 5 years and used to love the place. the last 2 visits the service has been terrible. He lady almost threw the plates and side dishes on the table. No courtesy not smile what so ever. We smiled and tried to better the situation and it did nothing. It’s sad, good food and terrible service. We’re going to have to start going to another Korean restaurant.",0
1490,"After trying to find a bar that suited our needs, we were directed to Cinder bar. We were welcomed by friendly staff and the host with the most Warren Kidd from NZ. Who welcomed us with a smile and stories to go with. We managed to watch the NRL grand final with all having a great time and bringing more friends. The chicken wings to die for and the mini sliders that helps the famished traveller. Beers on tap are, Stella Artois and max but never leave the place without trying the famous cinders flaming shot with Warren(host) explaining the process. Most westerners drink here. Bar staff are well mannered, trained and speak English. This cozy, warm, fun and cool place with a selection of music that will tickle your ears and suitable for all ages and its home away from home. Cinder bar can order your cab for you and Warren is happy to escort you and being fluent in Korean able to show off his skills with local knowledge conversing with the driver able to direct the driver to your final destination. I have attached two photos with address and direction from the business card. Smoking & Drinking is permitted outside but be aware of noise as neighbours are living near by. I have had many happy memories there and have met people from around the world there. It's not a nite club but more like a pub. Somewhere to relax, unwind, have a chat, catch up, and have a beer. I have given a 5 star rating for excellence in every aspect of service from the moment you walk in. It's so hard to leave. To Warren and Staff, thank you for everything on behalf of Rocket, Thor aka Thoro aka Tom. Signing off,

Jake",1
1491,"The staff greeted us warmly checking if we eaten at the restaurant and / or Korean food before...No and Yes. They asked if we needed help with the menu and also brought out complimentary sides which are also refilled for free which is a wonderful idea....not just because they're complimentary but because they tasted divine!!
It was my mum's first time eating Korean food and now recognises there was no need for apprehension. Every morsal was heavenly - our only disappointment was it was a light pre theatre dinner and we wanted to try more. 1st rate kimchi, salads are so flavoursome, the hot pot was amazing and katsu curry spot on.
I can't wait to come back for a full on bbq feast and try lots more. And its such an important note, the staff were friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there which is so refreshing. A real gem of a restaurant",1

The food at Miss Korea is delicious very healthy for the first time I tried cold buckwheat noodles and it was very nice, the old saying is don't knock it until you tried.
I want to move to South Korea if the food at Miss Korea restaurant is to go by please ignore the negative comment about it racist and unfriendly staff that Pearson who wrote that isn't a regular where as I am.",1
1494,"Came here with my friend, the novelty of the grill at the table was a big factor. The staff were really friendly and helpful when we were looking to order. We went for a big plate of different meats and it was really nice. The pork was amazing, it is quite expensive but it feels worth it.",1
1495,"After being recommended to go here by foreigners and Koreans alike I made the trip here (it's about an hour from where I live). Easy enough to find...keep the starbucks on your left and walk straight and pick up the sign!
I was instantly made welcome by Brandon the doorman who showed me in and sat me down at the bar. The owner Warren asked me what I was after drinkwise n made some excellent recommendations...all were consumed and were expertly made!
Warren has made an excellent atmosphere and the customers were all in on it. I arrived alone but left with the intention of going back and continuing to meet great people.

I can't recommend here enough...alone or in a group you will have a fun time. And check out the g n t's! From an English man, they hit the spot and more.

Thanks to all they guys at the cinder for a great time n I'll be seeing you again!",1

Just visit,

I have been several times now and I am extremely happy!!! The staff is friendly, the food is good, and the addition of a Karaoke club is even better!!! I have not had a bad meal here! The price is a bit steep, but I'm sure you can do better on price if you don't want to try everything, like I do!!!",1
1498,We ate there great korean dishes. Servings were big. It was my first time with this type of cuisine and I'm positively suprised. Although the place smells a little bit odd. I think that the reason is bad air conditioning or lack of ventilation.,0

1500,"Have been here a few times. The food is not bad but not really great either when you are paying $30+ per entree. The service always seems sketchy. and a bit uppity a la Summerlin location . Last night, with just a few people in the place, we got seated right next to a couple chatting away. I felt like I was at the same table with them. Couldn't figure out why the hostess did this. We got up and went to PF Changs. Not a good experience.",0
1501,Really fun authentic bar near the Songdo business district. Friendly staff and good collection of beers and spirits. Frequent it often and it's always fun!,1
1502,We tried the chicken and seafood dish for 2 and it was better than expected however very spicy. We enjoyed the style which was very interesting for us. They bring you the order uncooked then it get cooked infront of you on your table. Was also faster to cook than expected.,1
1503,"After reading some bad critics, I wasn't expecting much. But I was still very disappointed.

Cons:
- Service is bad. They are not polite, just throw the food on your table, not a single nice word.
- Atmosphere is bad. Only kids and young adults around 20 there. It feels like a high school canteen. 
- Food is terrible. Everything has a taste of burnt plastic. Probably the oil they use on the grill? Rests of soap? I can't even tell. The food itself is almost not seasoned so this plastic taste isn't even hidden by anything. 
- Price. 36$ for 1 coke and all-I-could-eat. Super expensive for the overall quality of the restaurant.

Pros: 
- It's fun to cook your meat yourself. For 5 minutes. Then it's just getting annoying.

tldr; never going back there. Even if it was free.",0
1504,Uninspiring looking from outside but I am glad someone had recommended it to me. You barbecue your food on a grill in the table and staff were very helpful explaining how to do it. Delicious flavours that were new to my palate. I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1

1506,"We brought a few friends who had never tried a korean BBQ before and they were very impressed by the food! It was reasonably priced, we got some things for the grill and a main meal which was very filling. The side dishes were excellent and the servers were very good about changing the grill often for us. A good time to go would be earlier on in the evening when it isn't too busy as the staff were very attentive and efficient. Will definitely be back!",1
1507,"We truly enjoyed the meal, service and show. It was one of my favorite experiences in our 17 night trip to Korea. My wife is Korean and researched the menus and shows on the Korean website. Since I am a picky eater, we chose the Haerin Jeongsik menu. A little more expensive but very good. we accompanied the meal with a couple bottles of Bek Se Ju which became my go to drink for the rest of the trip.

A quote from their website: The traditional court cuisine of Korea House is cooked on the basis of the records contained in ancient literature. The foods are cooked by superior chefs at Korea House under the supervision of 'Han Bok-ryeo' who has been designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 38 for his expert knowledge about the court cuisine of the Joseon Dynasty).

Service freindly and outstanding. Maybe due to the constant delivery of new dishes throughout the meal and my wife's ability to communicate in Korean if they didn't understand my Texan. All the staff were dressed in traditional Hanboks.

We enjoyed the show and would see it again, given the opportunity. I particularly like the instruments and sounds they made. One selection was 4 drummers on stage playing together and putting on quite a show. I also like the dancers and the way their dresses shape while spinning around. All seemed very graceful in their movement.

After the show, the performers were in the lobby for people to take photos with them.

We took tons of photos but unfortunately they are still on the phones. Go to http://www.koreahouse.or.kr/eng/?en_skin=index.html for more info on food and show.",1
1508,"I just ordered through deliveroo a kimchee bibimbap, extra crispy seaweed and a beer....I was having a night in, live very close to the restaurant and it arrived cold, the rice was so luke warm it was pretty much cold, for a restaurant that boasts of ""large portions"" the quantity of food was very small for the amount I paid. The food was not remotely satisfying, enough nor delicious and for the portion it was expensive. The beer was not even cold enough. Sorry lime orange this is not good enough! Even delivery to a close destination must be to a high standard",0
1509,"HORRIBLE SERVICE. I came with two of my siblings and order a table for 9 people (the others were on the way). For some reason they told us to come to them when everyone present and command us to wait outside. That was very rude since clearly there was a bench beside us to wait for the table, and they shove us away like we were beggars. The cashier was especially rude, he was the one who shove us away.

absolutely horrible!!

Do not order take away",0
1511,Very overpriced. The owner there is trying to cut down food cost so much that the quality of meat and vegetables that are used here is horrible. Do not go here.

1515,"I was on business in Korea, and my work colleagues took me out for a beer after work. Arrived at The Cinder Bar, which was my friend's regular. Primarily because it is one of the few true Expat Pubs in all of Incheon. The Kiwi, Warren, runs the Pub, and he was most hospitable. We settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely. Even had time for some fish and chips: the fish was covered in golden batter, and the chips were delicious. The bar looks a little broken down (as was the area it was located in), but that added to the charm. If it was a rugby night, you could watch the TV, but it would've been a bit of a squeeze. There was also an upstairs, loft-style area.
Overall, a pleasant evening after work.",1

First I will say the food is fresh and I really enjoy the mongo BBQ sauce. It's spicy, but very tasty. Genghis is over-priced, so don't be shocked by the bill. Also, paying tip for someone that just brings you drinks is a little hard to justify. This location is no good! Today my table was numbered incorrectly and there was some confusion on delivering my tables bowls. Secondly, being a rewards member I received two emails offering me a two for $25 deal. The manager would not accept the email for the reason that it was only for their arrowhead location. Uh ok. So am I only a rewards member for one location? This is horrible service. After being a loyal customer I feel this deal should have been accepted. So I won't be going there again.",0
1520,"The food is okay, but the owner is rude and disrespectful, the three of us came to that place the staff allow me to choose the table, and we choose the table with 4 desk near the wall, then the owner came and yell ""no no three persons here!! here no no no!!!"" he told us to move to the table at the back near kitchen. After we paid the owner not even say a single word and thank you (the other sajangnim we met in Korea always say thank you and polite, except this owner). I will never come to this place again",0
1521,"Nothing positive to say about Yoogane. Concept of mixed rice cooked in front of you is great. However, the rice had no flavor despite the heavy colors. It was dry and there was barely any cheese or chicken in the end product. I can't rave enough about the food Seoul has to offer but best avoid this one.",0
1522,"Me and my partner are from England and we were recommend the Cinder bar from some friends. The Owner Warren is from New Zealand and is a great character to have a chatter with over a good spirit/ cocktail. (He's super passionate about cocktails/ whiskey/ gin... you name it he can make it) He made us feel so welcome straight away and we ended up staying there until 4am i think! (Sorry Warren) :D

Great for expats to get a good drink!",1
1523,"I/we have visited the place twice in the past month. One was a quick lunch (the place does not offer any special lunch menu) and the other was what was to be a decent birthday celebration. Food is great in terms of its variety, authenticity, and freshness. Other reviews testify to this, show you pics etc so no need to delve in detail on this. The service is, however, problematic. The lunch experience was below average, service-wise, in terms of attentiveness etc but since the place was pretty empty, it was bearable. However, the birthday celebration on Friday night occassion with a place having being completely packed revealed and amplified this general problem. The staff was very nervous as a line of guests waited inside and outside the restaurant demanding to be seated. Afyer being seated, I had to leave the table three times - first to ask for the menu card (after 20 minutes waiting and not seeing anyone to come and say even hello), second to ask where our soup was after another 30 mins of nothing happening after i brought a waiter with me to the table, and, third, the same with our main course somehow not making it to our table, again, after 30mins, with soup balls still on table!!! Next tables were not served any better but the international crowd of youngsters seemed to be patient if dissatisfied too. Additionally, the right side of the restaurant was very cold and we kept our winter jacket on at times. BOTTOM LINE: I Will give it a third chance as we live nearby but if the service is not substantially improved i will go elsewhere then. There is another jap-korean restaurant nearby (wont identify not to be blamed for favouring it) which, albeit more expensive, provides top service.",0
1524,"We love Korean food, we visited this place while in a business trip. Unlike at home, ( Clarksville TN) they only gave 6 side dishes , which isn't so bad but the portions we VERY small. Then they didn't seem to want to give refills on the sides, we had to ask. The Gal bi was too salty and not as tender as we are use to.

The Champong was a bit too oily but had a pretty good flavor.

The spicy pork ( California Rolls ) were very good. The server was nice except for the fact that he didn't come to check on us for refills of sides.

Over all , if it's the only Korean place in town, I'll go back for another visit ... Maybe.

1525,"Best place to hang out in incheon! Good beers and good shots! staff is super friendly, we will come again for sure!!",1
1526,"Very fanciful, every table has a grill where everyone can cook the meat at will. Beyond that, a great variety of soups and salads. The staff is extremely kind and careful, the food tasty and the prices pretty good.",1
1527,It was amazing for me and my family as first timers eating korean bbq. Staff was nice and friendly. The food was delicious! B set is full of beef meat and the toppings were nice! Overall it was nice! Strongly recommended if you want to eat korean food.,1

Hope it makes it but I have a hard time believing it will. Too eclectic and expensive for Fort Mill.",0
1529,"Cinder bar is a great bar to visit when in Songdo. It can be found near the center of the city by the bridge. There is a good selection of beers and other drinks and Warren is always thinking about bringing in new ones.

The owner, Warren, is very friendly and open. There are often quiz nights, music and other events going on.

A great place to meet people as well.

It's worth a visit.",1
1530,We come here from time to time and service is always good but can get a little bogged down when busy. It is not a big place which adds to its charm but it can also get full very quick. The menu has the basics. I prefer more Korean BBQ foods but everything here is fresh and well prepared. Give it a shot.,0
1531,Loved this place. Different and friendly staff. Kids enjoyed helping grill the food at our own table! A new and fun food experience!,1
1532,"I found this place online and thought I would pay it a visit. Best decision I've made in quite some time. Everyone, both staff and customers, were extremely friendly. I got a few tips on how to adjust in Korea and a few drinks to forget all the cross cultural mistakes I was making. All in all, this is a great place and the only actual bar where you can sit up on a stool and pound a few pints. Take my word, you are going to want to atleast stop by here once.",1
1533,"We had Yoogane chicken galbi at a different branch the night before. Like it so much that we decided on lunch at a separate branch. This shop is much bigger, easier to find but service and food are not as good as previous night's. While browsing the menu, the waiter refused to take our order for beers. We chosen Yoogane marinated chicken galbi today but the cooking was too fast and the vegetables are very much half-cooked. This is one branch of Yoogane that I will avoid.",0
1534,"Me and a friend were feeling adventurous in trying out a new cuisine. We passed Miss Korea as an off chance. Thought we would try it. First up was the Korean tea...............very much an acquired taste too 'woody' for me. We ordered an appetizer to share (Belly Pork with Kimchi) which was rather a large dish. I felt it would have been better served with rice or noodles as it had a rich salty/ spicy taste to eat alone. The main courses were chicken Bibimbap and Seafood Udon Noodles. Both dishes were very tasty and filling. The bibimbap was an unusual dish as it is a very hot stone/ clay pot with rice at the bottom topped by vegetables and meat of your choice then a raw egg. The idea is to mix it all together before you eat it. Almost as if you are stir frying the dish!

Our waitress was very helpful and informative about the dishes we asked about. The downside was CASH only which we did not know until we asked for the bill.",1
1535,"Absolutely shit. First of all, shit taste. Their original chickens are soggy as hell and taste like white paper. 
Today I gave it a second chance to try their spicy chicken. They put hot sauce on chicken directly and it is so spicy that I can't handle it with even one bite. This restaurant didn't even ask me if I want sauce on side because it is super spicy.
Second, it is supposed to be a fast food restaurant but the average waiting time is over 15 minutes.
Crispy KFC chicken is way much better and cheaper.",0
1536,"Best to go to this place with a localite, as it will help with the ordering. They have a live stove in the middle of the table to help cook & keep the food hot. It is a very crowded & happening place and the food is tasty.",1
1537,"I haven't had great Korean BBQ in Boulder or Denver in years. I had a craving for Kal-bi and decided recently to give Korea House a try based on some other reviews on here. Not only did I have a great and high quality meal obviously prepared with care for a fair price but I enjoyed the hospitality and friendliness of the staff and the owners.

When I walk into Korea House I feel like I'm walking into the warm inviting home of my one of my school friends when I was growing up. The food and the experience is prepared with love. Check it out!!",1

1539,"My family, 5 of us, decided to to gave Dak agalbi so i decided to go to Yoogani here in Myeongdong. It was about 2pm.... The waiters did not even offer us seats when there were so many tables available.... we wanted to look at the menu but they did not even offer us the menu. I had to get menu myself... This was my second time in Korea & this was the worst experience! They seem not in the mood to entertain the guests coming in. We've been calling their attention but they jst ignored our calls! They were do RUDE!!! Very poor service!!! We all just decided to walked out onstead of having our food there! Seems lije they do not lije foreigners entering their restaurant.",0
1540,"Have been there for several times and really love the food. Be ready to wait for the food because it took ages for the food to come (except barbecue).

It has been a year since its reopening but they still accept cash only!!! This is very annoying because they used the same ""excuse"" every time which was that ""there is a problem with the card machine connection to the server at the moment ""!!! Come on! I've been to the restaurant around 10 times since their reopening last year and they explained the Cash Only thing with the same excuse every time!!

How could a card machine out of order for more than one year!? Because they never actually use the card machine!! Perhaps they're lying because of some particular reasons.

However, the food is good. Hope it would accept card payments as soon as possible.",1
1541,"This is a tough one for me to review! I spent a summer with my friends in Korea going to a number of Karaokes and in all fairness they weren't always clean or nice. That and $20 for one hour of Karaoke is a great rate. The service is actually pretty decent as well. But there's a vibe to the place that makes this place feel ghetto and trashy. The lack of a front door (and entrance by alley) starts things off on a bad note, and the interior is poorly put together. The rooms themselves felt a little small (although the Karaoke machines were the top of the line). 

The food of course was way overpriced and I would HIGHLY recommend against trying anything on the menu, unless it's an appetizer meant to be eaten as you drink. Not only is the quality of the food questionable, it is a poor representation of Korean food. 

At the end of the night, you will have fun with your friends. And even cost wise if you go with a large group and share food and drinks, the bill will be pretty reasonable. But that being said Sole could do a lot better and I am sorry that people might get the impression that Korean Karaokes are all like Sole.",0
1542,We had a feeling of North Korea for the evening. The food is honest and good and generously served. The waitresses are North Korean and they propose a stage performance which is taking you in another world and time. Definitely a place to stop by when you are in Phnom Penh,1
1543,"Great food and great service. Was so much fun to BBQ your own food at the table. Had a great selection on the menu, never had Korean food before but now a huge fan. Reasonably priced. Will definitely return again soon!",1
1544,".....I'm embarrassed to even say I went to eat here. That's how horrible it is. 

Atmosphere: not enough ventilation for a bbq joint. Only 1 of 4 burners we had were working properly so we had to ask the kitchen to prepare our meats.

Price: overpriced for the quality of foods. Your required to order a minimum of 2 of the kalbi and bulgogi which is $30+ an order but when you cook it it's less than a small Plate of meat for 2. I guess I'm used to California portions. 

Food: I think if we had the opportunity to grill our own meats to the doneness of how we like it - it would have tasted ok. My kids came to dinner bc they offered sushi.. They didn't have sushi at all. Hot stone wasn't even hot stone it was rice no crispy under bottom. 

Service: we asked for a couple minutes to look at the menu and the waitress never came back. My husband had to flag her down. Then well one of our burners didn't work bc our server elbowed our drink into the grill.  Changed it out but didn't work and then it seemed like it affected the burner next to it. They didn't replace the drink until I asked for it. Then we got a bill and still had to pay gratuity. After we paid our server came back and mumbled something about sorry for not giving us any service. 

Would I recommend? No never 
What I can I suggest to this place to improve? 
Have sufficient equipment.
Please please please train your staff if you're going to automatically charge gratuity so it's worth it.",0

Warren, the owner is kind, generous, respectful, and so are the rest of his crew. This is the first and only review I have written on my own for any travel site, and I will say this bar is a great place to make new and promising friends. You will get to meet some great people, many of whom are regulars there like myself... not saying I drink to often, but that I enjoyed hanging out with people from the bar. Not only is this bar a great meet up for old friends or new friends, but even other bar owners or restaurant come here to have a great time.",1

1548,Beware! Horrible service. We went to all you can eat lunch and if you leave meat on the plate the waiter will charge you extra at the end of lunch. The meat looked like dog food with no flavor. I left the place wanting to throw up. Never again!!!!!!,0
1549,"Enjoyed the BBQ platter and most delightful seafood pancake for starter, but staff rushed to take the starter away. Meat was excellent, had to ask for extra lettuce and spring onion to eat it all and was charged extra for it, which I thought was unnecessary considering the cost.

Would not recomend at all.",0

We had some starters then had the BBQ banquet to share. You get your choice of meat brought to the table and you cook it to your preference on a BBQ/grill on your table. Meat was so fresh and tasty. Was served with lettuce leaves and rice to make a wrap. Staff so friendly and helpful. Food 10/10, we will definitely be back.",1
1556,"I've had Korean BBQ before. Its not really my thing since I can cook reasonably well at home so there's little fun in doing this in a restaurant. However my teenage daughters fondness for K-Pop made her ask to go here. We went. Table was OK. Place was light and airy. We saw about twelve ingredients on display for the customers to add to their meals. Soy and chili, coriander, spring onions, oyster sauce, two red bean sauces and so on. Nothing really exotic and nothin particularly Korean. Supermarkets have most of these ingredients nowadays. We ordered tempura starters and although huge and expensive for starters they weren't awfully good. Tempura batter was darker, oilier and heavier than the best I've had. Particularly for the prawns. My veg tempura was a little better but still not great. We ordered beef mains. Meagre portions considering other places in Edinburgh offer more variety. We got three bowls of lukewarm sticky rice which was more ""badly made"" than actually sticky. I can make better at home and I expect better from restaurants. I won't come here again. The Korean beer we wanted was out of stock. Our starters arrived several minutes apart and the nice waiting staff told me the kitchen was busy. There was about ten more diners in the place than we three. We had pints of Diet Coke each. Bill was pricey for what we received although average for the typical fare. Sadly this place was below par.",0
1557,"The King Prawn starter was delicious the Katsu chicken not so much. The vegetable dumplings were not good, the veggie in our group took a bite and suspected that it contained meat only after 3x going backwards and forwards were we able to determine that they contained quorn. This was very poorly handled and none of the servers seemed to know what the dumplings contained.
.
My main was half cold, 1/4 warm and 1/4 hot ... I was told that the hot bowl would warm my food but my friend had the same and her rice was too hot to eat so this cannot be the case. I chose to leave my food.
We also ordered spicy chicken wings which tasted nice but the waiters walked past our table multiple times and we were only given napkins after about 15 minutes.

They seemed to avoid the table seemingly not wanting to deal with the situation and probably not wanting us to ask for it to be removed from the bill. The bill came to £72 for the 4 of us we paid £20 each but would have been justified in not leaving a tip and requesting for the ""veg"" starter and main meal be removed. It's a shame that they didn't offer a better level of customer service, I can't in good faith reccommend them to others.",0
1558,"Went again just after Christmas. This place never stops being my favourite. Tried bibimbap this time, the portion size was great and the flavour amazing. Friends got bulgogi and soups. Seafood pancake always wonderful. I will keep going! If they will ever offer delivery service will be the end of me, I'll eat korean every day!",1

The service was good, side dishes were sufficient, seating was comfortable but the two dishes we ordered were very disappointing: soft tofu soup with beef didn't have enough veggies and had a sour taste to it and the sweet and sour pork had a really thick breading and the pork was marinated with a bit too much pepper for my taste.  Tried better Korean restaurants in the same street.",0
1563,We were offered to taste samples of Great Collection of beer. Hence we could try and select the best. Best quality beer and food though very limited on the menu. He ensures the best.

1564,"On our second day in Seoul we tried Chicken Galbi Yoogne in MyeongDong shopping town.
The restaurant that claim themselves as Korea's number One chicken Galbi has been in the business since 1981. A narrow entrance and staircase brought us to the second floor of the shop. We waited around 15-20 min at the staircase as they only have around 15-20 tables and no waiting room.

We ordered Marinated Chicken Galbi Fried Rice and the Marinated Chicken Galbi by itself with the addition of extra noodles, rice and cheese. They are cooked in front of us and everyone was given an apron to prevent any spraying from the cooking. Main ingredients were chicken, cabbage, oil and chili . Chili empowering the whole dish, so for some people, the dish might be too strong and spicy but it is very delicious.
Kimchi and other pickles were self served and they are fresh.
For me personally, one experience of eating here is enough.
Room is spacious,well lighted and clean but one bad thing was that the toilet is outside the dining room and is not very clean and is stinky.",1
1565,"I had one of the most stressful airport experiences I’ve ever dealt with, left the airport to find some drinks/food and stumbled across The Cinder Bar. The owner and his amazing bartender from Vietnam completely turned around my entire day. 5 minutes in I had a huge smile in my face from the friendliness of the staff. I had some drinks which were all great prices and a burger which was delicious. Perfect for if you have a layover that’s long enough to leave the airport but not long enough to go too far. Incredible place!",1
1566,"Miss Korea is a small, but smart looking little restaurant. There is a detailed menu and lots to choose from. It sounds like some people have had a bad experience, but really in my eyes it was very positive. The menu offers great choice but doesn't give you too much support if you're not familiar with Korean cuisine, that said it compared favourably to my previous experience with Korean restaurants. The food was quick, well presented, seasoned and flavoured and good value. The drinks a little more expensive but not out of sync with other restaurants. We didn't have any experience with the tap water, but in fairness to them at least they're up front about it. The service was attentive, no waiting at all to be helped, there was no checking-in on your enjoyment during the meal which is a little unusual but really not an issue for me. I would go again and would be happy to recommend it to others too.",1
1567,"We've had high expectations as we booked the Korea royal cuisine online costing us quite something even the package we chosen was the cheapest one.

The experience was contrary to what we expected. First, we were not sitted in a Palace like dining area. In fact it was like a shack with no window to any outside view and only big enough for 4 square tables inside. Next there's no air circulation comfort in the room, and it's next to the kitchen. So no ambience, no comfort and no view!

The food spread was good but was averagely prepared. There are couple of nice dishes such as the nicely cooked abalone but a lot other were very basics & ordinary. The cutlery used were also very ordinary making us feel the value for money is not worth it. Not to mention the beef was so tough that Myeongdong street bbq beef is so much better!

Conclusion, we feel the charges is simply not worthy the food & ambience provided, and we suspected this is far from the real Royal cuisine. Skip this!",0
1568,"It was the history of the building and the so called traditional Joseon Dynasty meal described in the website that make me want to experience eating there. The reception where guests were received was bare, and I mean really bare. There was only a standing podium and a staff to receive the guests and check the name for the reservation. We were led to a dining room which looked like a dining hall. Not a tinge of class or history in there. Lunch was mediocre. We can get better food costing much less in restaurants in town. Description of the buildings within the compound seemed very interesting in the website but again I was disappointed. I mean they were architecturally nice traditional buildings but not as grand as I expected.
I was disappointed with the meal but may be it was lunch and the set meal that I gave have chosen is a let down. I give them the benefit of doubt that the Korean banquet and the meal with show may be better. The only thing traditional from this experience is that all the lady staff are dressed in their hanbok. Credit must be given to the staff who responded to online booking and enquiries promptly.",0
1569,"My wife and I went in for the first time, based on the reviews.  We were surprised to see what looked like an old Captain D's building as the site - not very appetizing.  After deliberating we decided to give it a try and went and sat down.

After looking at the menu over and over, I planned on getting tofu with mixed vegetables.  I simply couldn't bring myself to spend $15 on an entree (most items were $13 - $16) at a restaurant that looked like a former Captain D's, and I had serious doubts about the quality of ingredients going into the entrees.  I could tell my wife was having second thoughts as well, so starving as we both were, we left and went elsewhere.

Sometimes you have to trust your gut, especially when it's starving and giving you reservations (pun intended).",0
1570,"Joons unfortunately does not taste as good as it used to. Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't busy at all. However, they still seemed understaffed and took a while to even start us with water. We ordered the dakgalbi with teriyaki chicken, and came with watered down teriyaki sauce. I mean, you can barely even taste the sauce. Another downside is they limit only one noodle selection per pan. I was really looking forward to eating here that night but unfortunately due to this experience, we won't be returning again.",0

My husband had the tofu bibimbap, I had sauteed octopus and veggies (nicely spiced) and our son loves the beef galbi.

1584,"I came here and ordered a small bowl for $12.49 and my husband a medium bowl for $14.49. The bowl I reviewed was so tiny! That tiny little thing for $12.49? Jeez. I made my bowl and everything was good. They got my husband's bowl wrong though. He requested pasta and had rice. 

Overall the service was good. My bowl was good, my husbands bowl didn't taste that great. But I wasn't satisfied because the bowl was so small! I'm a tiny girl, and I wasn't even half full from this meal. I've had build your own bowls before and you can go to Mongolian grill for cheaper price and 3x bigger bowl to fill up.",0
1585,"Their food is absolutely amazing! Very friendly environment and staffs. Good price. Would 100% definitely visit again if we visit Edinburgh! Highly recommended!
The only thing is that they have bbq at the dining table but they didn’t have the exhaust fan for it which makes all the clothes smell like bbq when you walk out off the restaurant.",1
1586,We greatly enjoyed the food at Korea House Restaurant. We each ordered different meats and then shared them. The Beef Bulgogi was by far our favorite. We will go again when we are in Florida!,1
1587,"Bad service !!! Miss Korea the worse restaurant ever!!!! Which I walked out a restaurant first time in my life !!!!!
Been there before they refurnished.
Just been in again after long time, only few tables and not busy at all. Very rude staff who don't even be bother answer question and smile and gave you an awkward face constantly; took her 2 seconds to repeat the order, which don't even allow you to ask her to repeat again!
She claimed herself as Manager which I don't believe she is and I openly said to her ""well you obviously failed your life and will stuck here forever! ""
Then I just walked out a restaurant for the first time in my life.
Very very bad restaurant! Strongly not recommend anyone to go there, it will totally ruin your night out!!!!",1
1588,"Irrespective of whether you are a local, an expat living in Korea or just passing through the area, you really should be visiting The Cinder Bar. Put simply, you won't find a warmer welcome, a nicer atmosphere or a more enjoyable environment to spend an evening in.
The thing that really stands out about the place is that the team there are clearly genuinely interested in you having a good time whilst you are there and go out of their way to show warmth and friendliness, irrespective of if you are a regular or a visitor from out of town.
Food is tasty, drinks are excellent, cocktails are made with care and attention to detail. Prices are extremely reasonable, too.
The really nice thing about the place is that the positivity is infectious! Not only are the staff incredibly friendly and helpful, but this rubs off on the clientele, too. It really does feel like a little community!
If you are looking to spend an enjoyable time in the area, this is the first place to visit.",1
1589,The Cinder Bar is a quaint little place good for food and drinks. It's small so it can get crowded quite quickly; but everyone is friendly and if you're lucky Warren might mix you up something special that isn't found on the menu.,1
1590,"This is the type of place you go to with people who you're comfortable enough to stuff your face with. Because I don't care how much willpower you think you have, once that menu is set on the table, Pandora's box is opening, and it's full of Korean BBQ. 

Now it's not the best Korean BBQ spot ever, but it's certainly not the worst. You get what you pay for, and you'll leave satisfied. That's really all there is to it. That said, I could eat their deep fried scallops by the cupful (not recommended).",0
1591,"My friends and I are regulars at KBBQ and although their normal dishes are very good, we love the Korean barbeque the most. It's super fun to cook the meat yourself, although if you're nervous the staff will jump in to help, or cook it for you if you prefer. Even as a group of students we find we can all leave full and happy for around £10-20 per person depending on how greedy we are about the meat selection! A great place to spend some quality time with friends or family and enjoy crazy tasty food all the while.",1
1592,"Ok, maybe I was given old food or a messed up order, but my to-go order was disgusting! I ordered half and half wings and the chicken fried rice. None of it had flavor. The spicy wings had spice but no flavor. The sweet wings had flavor in spots. The rice had absolutely NO flavor. I totally wasted $23, won't finish my meal, and won't be back. I wasn't even given a fork or condiments.",0
1593,"Warren and his staff are fantastic, personal and attentive. They will know your name next time & welcome you home. Happy hour specials are attractive & atmosphere is welcoming.",1
1594,"Popped in on spec during Chinese New Year celebrations, so there was a bit of a wait for a table. We do enjoy Korean bbq, first we ordered vegetable Goyza whilst waiting for the bbq to warm up. We then had a selection of dishes, beef in beer, chicken, mushrooms, spuds etc along with lettuce, rice and chilli and garlic for me to give the meal an extra kick. The dishes did come out rather haphazardly, indeed the potatoes which took the longest to cook came out last. House wine is great value at around £13 a bottle, there’s beer to inc. Hite if you want something Korean. Service is slightly random, though tbf it was very busy when we arrived. Food is good though, and overall we certainly enjoyed our meal. And at £50 excl service it’s good value. Btw it’s cash only here (plenty of cash points nearby).",1
1595,"Wow that's really the most amazing Asian restaurant I discovered in Edinburgh. Friendly environment, wonderful cuisine, reasonable prices.
The food is fresh and delicious. You can decide to go for one of the share bbq platter or for traditional Korean dishes. In any case, it will be a perfect choice.
It's preferable to book in advance.",1
1596,"On our last day in Bristol we popped into this restaurant for lunch although it looked pretty empty. The ambience was a bit on the dark side and it didn’t appear very clean with an open kitchen that looked like a corridor. Once we sat down we ordered Mandu which I guess is the Korean version of Gyoza. The flavour wasn’t too bad although I would have left it a bit more in the pan to get the pastry a bit crispier. The Seafood Pancake (which didn’t appear to have much seafood inside) with spring onion wasn’t too bad either although the middle was uncooked and had a gluey consistency. Then came the masterpiece! We orderered 2 katsu curry (Chicken and Pork) from the special lunch menu but we got was 2 cutlets in gloopy sauce that I believe is a different dish and it remainded me of branston pickle! I had the pork and the colour of the meat was almost black and had a funny taste. My fiancé’s chicken was a touch better but again it had a funny taste. We complained and they asked if we wanted something else and because we were famished we asked if we could have 2 portions of Mandu instead which were the best part of our meal but this time they arrived undercooked and one of them was cold in the middle. I don’t have a problem if they were frozen before but at least they could have been cooked properly. It is not that they were too busy either, there was us and another table, so why the rush? We complained again and the waitress then later on the owner pretended that there was a misunderstanding regarding the curry. Well, that wasn’t our problem as we had ordered from the daily special menu and there was only one curry option! Anyway the owner wanted us not to pay the bill but we insisted that we wanted too and at end we paid for the 2 dishes we ate. This has to be one of the most unpleasant meals for sometime!",0
1597,"I have been to this bar twice and every time there were plenty of people, especially foreigners. The service is good and the quality of the products also.",1
1598,We were there with 13 guys. We ordered a mix of meat and fish and that was very good. The people were very friendly and gave us good information about the menu's. We've been twice now!,1
1599,"Came with some friends yesterday and the service was okay. We had the $18.99 Korean BBQ all you can eat per person with 2.25 fountain drinks. At the end the price for tip is included in the total which is not acceptable in my opinion. The food was okay, the beef and pork weren't the freshest but the chicken redeemed it. Dessert is not included. I would say that it is an okay place to go because it's so close but other than that it's nothing special.",0
