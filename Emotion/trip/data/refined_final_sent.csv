review,PN
our first dining experience in a north korean restaurant totally run and operated by women folks from north korea if you are there for dinner you could get to enjoy the performances traditional and modern from waitresses that double up as performers waitresses were friendly and despite the fact that they have to multi task did not slow down the service the whole experience was quite strange food wise that s not too bad at all but i would not return just for the food and the performance once is good enough ,1
it was my first meal in north korean restaurant comparing to similar korea food restaurant the interior is simpler and atmosphere is rather nothing special however the food was great i ordered so yukgejang spicy beef soup with a bowl of rice and the taste was one of the best for such soups i was alone there for my lunch but was served by two beautiful ladies though out the meal and it was pleasant experienced to chat with various topics with north koreans highly recommended to try food there and have a chat with them ,1
food are generally good tried lunch bulkogi grilled beef and reimen cold noodle which were not bad or could say even better than expected reasonably priced served by beautiful waitressesabout most probably selected ones who spoke english and or japanese rather strange setting many long and big tables mainly for group guests better ask for a smaller table ,1
food is generally good worth mentioning are kimchi which is mild spicy version chewy tasty stirred fried beef excellent scallop not forgetting the spicy taufu soup the waitresses dressed in korean traditional dresses will go up the stage for musical performance around 8 pm which is kinda interesting ,1
we ve passed by the place a couple times and were always curious about what goes on inside and what north korean cuisine is about when our friends came for a visit we thought what better way to entertain them after reading the reviews online food was really really delicious the fried sesame leaves were a surprise we love the topoki rice cake kimchi and especially this cold pork slices dish we were late for the show and yes our waitress too left us midway service and hopped on the stage to perform show starts at 7 30pm every nite it was a hoot just watching the whole fanfare but we had a tonne of fun the only drag about the place was the chain smoking customers will we be back maybe when we have friends in town to entertain ,1
this restaurant is like the setting of a 60s bond movie food overpriced and too spicy for my sensitive palette waitresses creepy and unfriendly only smiling when presenting the bill an alienating experience was so hungry after had to buy so e dumplings from a roadside stand ,0
be sure to try the fried sesame leaves food was good and at 8 00 a dancing and singing show started it lasted about 35 minutes i had expected propaganda because i heard there would be some but there was not table service was ok but not great a bit difficult to get our waitress s attention ,0
we had a feeling of north korea for the evening the food is honest and good and generously served the waitresses are north korean and they propose a stage performance which is taking you in another world and time definitely a place to stop by when you are in phnom penh,1
i have been to several north korean restaurants in several cities they are pretty similar in many ways nothing special if you have been to a north korean restaurant but if you are familiar with the korean food often seen in south korea some dishes with the same names are worth tasting north koreans make kimchi with a different way very unique not the best place if you expect a conversation with your friends because their music is loud and are the reason a lot of people going there for and who knows what the waitresses would do when they hear what you are talking about they all speak khmer english and apparently korean very well ,1
in the middle of phnom penh you ll find this strange place the waitresses all very beautiful and look exactly the same are sent here from north korea and stay for about three years the purpose to inform us about how fantastic there home country is the food was quite good actually not so different from cambodian food but we avoided dog and some other strange dishes at 7 30 this was on a friday the show started all of a sudden our waitresses stopped serving food and got on stage they danced something that reminded me of sound of music and then they sang honey honey abba and one of the played the violin good enough to get a job in any simphony orchestra in the end they picked up three electric guitars and played the whole show was just so bizarre that we sat laughing all the time we brought our three children and they didn t like the food so much but enjoyed the show of course you should not support the regime of north korea i feel a bit ashamed about it but it really was an interesting experience ,1
frequent this unique place tasty north korean food accompanied by the performance of waitresses a musical dinner a must to visit ,1
i never thought that i d be getting any sort of north korean experience while i was in cambodia but it s like a buy one get one fly to cambodia and see north korea they show was amazing i enjoyed it a lot i was totally awed by the way they spun and twirled and the many many instruments that could play they don t allow you to take pictures inside but they won t ask you to delete your photos either once you get your chance to the food was okay but just order a simple dish or something and just enjoy the show ,1
heard a lot about this place one of our visitors said was his favorite restaurants in phnom penh could not wait to try it it was interesting and unusual from a western perspective but definitely not as freaky as others might think the food was good not the best korean food i have ever had had north korean food in seoul which was better the pork ribs and bimbimbap at a hot stove pot was pretty good the dumpling and the vegetable dish were nothing to write home about the waitresses were definitely quite talented well dressed and well groomed my friends thought they look angry from time to time they were a bit stressed since they had to wait on all customers and to perform as well don t expect that they will come by to chat with you the waitresses and the show definitely were trying to reinforce the traditional expectation of women being very thin submissive and gentle no wonder most of the patrons there tonight were males who knows how much of the show were truly north korean or modified to feed a particular expectation the restaurant is closed by 9 pm which i did not expect overall not very memorable food was only alright would not likely go back as the place did allow smoking which always put a big dent on the overall dining experience ,0
i have seen and eaten at many freaky restaurants in africa and asia but this is restaurant is a different ball game altogether it felt like i was in a place meant for north korean propaganda and that experience alone deserves five stars food is decent yes there is dog meat if you want to try it there is a limited beer selection but the best part of the restaurant is the waitresses and the videos all waitresses are made to look like dolls and perform in between serving your food expect anything from a covering of celine dion to hardcore rock music my waitresses hurriedly dropped food at my table and rushed to get on stage it was quite the spectacle and then there are the videos lush landscapes and beaches which i assume are meant to project n korea is a good light definitely visit if you are in the area ,1
the food quality is excellent but more interestingly is the multi talented waitress they were wearing similar dress and they are very beautiful these waitress serve dishes for you and then they skillfully perform sing dance and play band amazing ,1
this restaurant is at the main road of monivong bld we were sceptical after reading the reviews n possible motives behind it however we decided to try it since we will never visit pyongyang yes all the waitresses are dressed in yellow n red chiffon hanbok same shoes same scrunchy n similar hairstyle etc they are soft spoken pretty n friendly with the korean guests the food is rather similar to south korean s or it s just those dishes that we ordered the kimchi with pork 8 was good not sour or too oily the dog soup 12 is probably an acquired taste with lots of spice n some chilli the boiled mackerel fish 10 is yummy for fish lovers jinro soju is a tad too expensive for our liking at 6 the performance starts at 8pm with the waitresses singing dancing n playing guitar drum keyboard n gu zheng very impressive definitely worth a visit for the curious but pls bear with those ppl smoking in the air conditioned restaurant ,1
this whole series of restaurants serve as nothing but a cash collector for the nk government if you don t mind that get the dog stew it was pretty good in fact all the food was pretty good it s expensive for pp but then again you are paying for the hennesey drinking habits of an entire country s plutocracy ,1
avoid avoid avoid the service received or lack of was disgraceful it was the worst i have ever received in any restaurant in the world after being made to feel extremely uncomfortable we walked out not ordering anything vowing never to return again do not bother spending your money and your time there plenty of other restaurants in phnom penh to choose from where you are treated with respect and courtesy something this restaurant lacks,0
this is a restaurant that is definitely worth a visit heard from a friend that it is one of the only two north korean restaurants that is not in north korea food there is on the expensive side cost us usd 34 for a stir fried pork dumplings kimchi soup beef fried rice and drinks but the show in itself is worth it food was pretty good as well the show consists of a series of dancing singing and percussion it starts at 8pm so you may want to go slightly earlier to have your dinner and concentrate on the show when it starts you are also not allowed to take pictures we went at about 8pm when the staff are preparing for the show and they looked a bit flustered and service was a little rude however this changed completely after the show and they were really friendly and asking whether you enjoyed the food and the show highly recommended place most tuk tuk drivers should know where it is so it should not be difficult to get there ,1
if you don t mind propping up the north korean regime then take a visit to pyongyand probably the closest to north korea you will ever get in line with other reviewers very bizarre to see the waitresses suddenly performing rousing songs on stage also had to chuckle when we saw stewed dog on the menu no we did not order it ,1
this is the restaurant equivalent of smoking dmt you do it once and appreciate the experience and then never do it again because you fear for your mental health i felt really wierd being there as its like supporting the north korean government who didn t get this well known by being happy fluffy hippies the waitresses are cold and unsmiling only my male mates were too impressed by them to tell hand picked apparently after half an hour of kimchi and incredibly expensive beer they launched into this colourful whirling screeching show with happy smiling faces for the best part of an hour before going back to being grim and austere again the place has the weirdest vibe of anywhere i ve ever been there wasn t much after dinner banter i think we were all in a little shock like i said it was a great experience and i m glad i went but wow would i go back maybe just once ,1
sitting down and reading the rather high prices on the menu at this restaurant i figured i must be missing something the large unattractive brightly lit room was full of customers the service was sporadically slow and unfriendly the food was nothing to write home about which left me scratching my head why were there some many people here and then it happened the lights were dimmed as images of serene forests and waterfalls looped on the flat screen tv a piano accordion suddenly appeared and the waitresses began singing there were fake bouquets of flowers costumes resembling the ugly duckling after she grew into a beautiful swan heart shaped maracas mostly north korean karaoke songs and a random version of on top of the world by the carpenters the highlight was the waitresses rocking out on electric guitar bass guitar and a drum solo yes it was overpriced yes it was extremely weird yes i would never go back but without a doubt i will never forget it ,0
this is another one of those best kept secrets firstly as a westerner you will feel like the only person there you will be the place is full of koreans and some other asian nationalities the place is brightly lighten the menu was interesting guess there is no real difference between south korean and north korean cuisine either that or we did try some of the more unique offerings the waitresses are a highlight wearing very bright almost brides dresses they are very friendly and speak perfect english but then they double as the cast of the most fantastic restaurant show i have seen loads of fun and just a overall great experience go experience you will not be disappointed an absolute treat ,1
if you look for quiet place i guess it is not the right place for you since they have live music smoking speaking loudly korean and chinese what impressed me a lot is waitress there she play as many role she can be waitress singer instrument when is the time most of waitress will be on stage sing dance ,1
if you fancy korean food in phnom penh this is the place decent food in aircon but a must see floor show about 7pm all singing all dancing north korean culture and propaganda top value entertainment on the quirky scale ,1
if you truly want to get a taste of what authentic korean food taste like i would not recommend miss korea average food at the expensive prices i praise for the menu tho as it has a good variety of choices between side dishes chicken seafood beef etc i believe the most proud dish of the restaurant of the bbq however i personally think the dish is over priced for the under seasoning meat little proportion on the dish nevertheless i do recommend to order tteokbokki korean rice cake and the rice dishes as they are quite delicious and easy to eat ,1
popped in on spec during chinese new year celebrations so there was a bit of a wait for a table we do enjoy korean bbq first we ordered vegetable goyza whilst waiting for the bbq to warm up we then had a selection of dishes beef in beer chicken mushrooms spuds etc along with lettuce rice and chilli and garlic for me to give the meal an extra kick the dishes did come out rather haphazardly indeed the potatoes which took the longest to cook came out last house wine is great value at around 13 a bottle there s beer to inc hite if you want something korean service is slightly random though tbf it was very busy when we arrived food is good though and overall we certainly enjoyed our meal and at 50 excl service it s good value btw it s cash only here plenty of cash points nearby ,1
i came here twice so far and love the food miss korea is a real authentic korean restaurant with bbq plates on the table and a huge menu of everything from kimchi pancakes bibimbap and a variety of jigae to bbq meat and seafood grilled and fried dishes plus a full vegetarian menu the quality of food here is excellent and they re kimchi is the best i ve ever had in terms of uk korean restaurants the portions are big and the prices are cheap mains are around 8 9 starters are around 5 each the service is basic at best the staff are efficient but not too attentive they also do not accept card so it s cash only which is a downside i loved the seafood bibimbap and spicy tofu jigae both tasted divine overall high quality flavorful and authentic korean food cheap prices generous portions but average service ,1
for a first timer trying korean cuisine this is a great place to start especially loved the hotpot bean sprouts and fish cakes ,1
food there is so good we order the soup barbecue meat and fried chiken they are all beyong my imagination it is definitely the best korea restaurant i have ever been ,1
my husband took me for new years spotted how busy it was usually a good indication of quality staff are friendly and helpful food was so tasty and very well presented fab my new fave restaurant,1
having been to many korean restaurants in the uk mainly london i can say without a doubt that this one is the best for food service is good and the setting is nice value wise they give generous portions definitley worth a visit if you re in birmingham it is situated just on the outskirts of chinatown ,1
went with family really enjoyed the food having been to most of the restaurants in china town i can say the quality was one of the best service was quick considering how busy it was,1
food is amazing but seriously the service is awful still worth going tho the quality of the food outweighs the crap service,0
this was my first time and it was a little unsure as i have never had korean however i really enjoyed myself and found the ombience inviting good service and tasty food,1
so rocked up here last night with family and friends for my birthday me hi have a table booked for 8 at 7 them errrrr that was kind of the way the rest of the night went drinks order took over 20 mins to arrive waitress to order the food took as long again to come over then better part of an hour wait for anything my meal came out everyone else got left waiting had to go up twice to chase up everyone elses food must have been at least another 20 mins before some of theirs came i had long finished before the 2 katsu curerys came at the end ill give them their dues they were very apologetic and threw in a couple of rounds of drinks and some food to try and appease things which softened the blow a little the food though was really really good bitter sweet really bursting with flavours cooked to perfection and well presented no one had anything other than beaming smiles they tucked in and it was clean plates all round not a bad word to say about that just a shame that the service was soooo bad if you dont mind spending 4hrs in a restaurant feeling like no one cares about your experience the food is ore than worth it xx,0
we have never tried korean food so were looking forward to tasting something different we were greated and seated quickly and then informed they only accept cash i wonder why that is the service was terrible staff who couldn t care less the food came out in dribs and srabs over 15 minutes mains first and then 15 mins later the rice useless i wouldn t recommend miss korea ever ,0
i really enjoyed this place i went there with my korean friend totally affordable and genuine food relaxed atmosphere we spent 28 in total,1
decent korean food service is ok seems like a fairly new restauranteur team so some of the sequencing was a bit off for example we ordered 2 starters but one came after we d started the main course so we sent it back and my wife s main course came a few minutes after mine which we had to flag however the team of waitresses were well dressed and couldn t do enough to help once they had realised their mistake so overall decent food a friendly restaurant team they just need to improve some of their sequencing overall miss korea is a good edition to birmingham s burgeoning asian restaurant quarter ,1
went to miss korea with my friend today we had bbq between two of us we ordered mixed beef and pork and also spare ribs soup with potatoes they all came in big portion great value for money and high quality meat nice enviroment and friendly staff had a really good time we will definitely visit again ,1
we really enjoyed miss korea the food was outstanding and i would recommend you to try this restaurant,1
this place serves one of the best korean food in uk but the service is far from good the owner should really monitor the service from their staff,1
a little slow on the cooking but worth waiting excellent korean authentic food experience will definitely be coming back for more,1
never been to a korean restaurant before so can t really compare it but the food was great fresh ingredients make for tasty different flavors from what i m used to ambience is poor and decoration is somehow boring if you can ignore this then its fine staff was correct i d come back ,1
massively underwhelmed with this place very few bbqs actually worked the food was honestly slightly dodgy although their veggie kimchi pancake and tofu were lovely but then again quite expensive for what they were the staff were rude and slow only two tables were busy and you cant pay with card i had a really hot soup which was served with a metal spoon and burnt my tongue massively ,0
not good terrible experience no help from a stupid waitresses for complex menu need to send them back for training for a a good customer service not again its a waste of time and money ,0
 you guys are stupid that is what you said i had heard excellent things about this place but the experience i had today was the complete opposite first of all the one waitress at the place was absolutely rude she had the worst scowl on her face and had kept pinning everything she did wrong on somebody who had little english skills as we had previously mentioned to the woman she had misheard one of the orders which to me when she was taking the orders looked like she didn t give a flying toss when we explained she got the order wrong she gave us the dirtiest look and told us we were wrong and spent 30 minutes trying to get us to eat something we did not order and when we finally received what we had originally ordered it was once again not the right food we had pointed specifically to braised chicken bulgogi with bbq sauce which we pointed at the photo which we revived a dish which we did not order after finishing the food we received the bill and split it between 7 of us and 2 of the girls left shortly after as soon as the girls had left the waitresses came over to tell us that they messed the bill up and it went from 78 to 85 which i must say we are 15 and some of us do not have a lot of money and would have helped if they could have told us before the girls had left so overall i will not be re visiting and i do not recommend going there ,0
the food was slightly below average the service is as bad as it can get it s a wonder how they are still open but then again it s cash only so maybe someone is forgetting to declare their taxes won t be returning ,0
we ate in here for the 1st time on a monday night the restaurant was very busy and has a great ambiance the servers were all friendly and the food is excellent to start with we had the chicken kangpopi which was larger enough to have been a main course the sauce was very good not too spicy but had enough flavour for my main course i had the chicken katsu again this was very good the chicken was well cooked and the curry sauce was great the sticky rice was also brilliant my wife had a beef dish which she enjoyed and was well cooked this was my first visit to miss korea and will not be my last for a starter 2 mains a soft drink and 1 glass of wine the total was 34 which is excellent value ,1
good was lovely drinks were served quickly food not so quickly waitress service wasn t the best seemingly too rushed off their feet to be too friendly or offer any menu guidance etc we have eaten korean bbq before but they should really assume that and should take the time to offer to assist new clientele we ordered squid beef and spicy pork with sides for the bbq everything was lovely and fresh staff were attentive at keeping an eye on bbq temperature and replacing the grease proof paper laid over the bbq though i would recommend but maybe not for ppl trying korean for the first time ,1
went with my husband and 13 year old son it was a good pleasant atmosphere service a bit slow as low on waiting staff steak was very good ox tongue and belly pork was not pleasant chicken was average ,0
i ve been there with friends 3 times and trust their advice on what to eat as menu is complex and difficult to use the food is tasty and there is certainly no rush to take orders deliver food and drink and to bring the bill on each occasion there have been lots of chinese and or korean customers so this must mean they re doing something right remember to take cash as they don t accept card payments ,1
not welcoming sat for 35mins didn t ask if we need help with the complex menu no drinks offered no do you need help we got up and left nobody asked us or approached us we had no idea what we were doing all we got was there is your seat there is your menu went to miss vietnam instead it has started well already got our drinks ,0
had a fabulous meal cannot fault it in any way our eating experience at miss korea was very enjoyable this was our second visit and both times it was outstanding everything we had was fresh the staff were very helpful and polite i would highly recommend this restaurant if your willing to have a go at cooking some things yourself it s fun and a must try for anyone who likes something different for people who don t want the bbq there s enough choice on the menu reasonably priced too excellent can t wait to come back,1
went to try this restaurant the very first time but they successfully made us not to return the cash only restaurant which you will be told when you sit down and of course again and again afterward it was quick when order the food but long waiting time after that you need to be patience and not too hungry so keep chatting or bring a book food was a bit disappointed frozen meat was served for bbq maybe it is ok vegetables were not fresh food portion is small we ordered a kimchi fire rice as we love kimchi but it was so hard to dig out some kimchi and can hardly see the pork service was awful all waitresses may had a super hard day one of them turned off our bbq cooker suddenly without even said a word when we still have meats on there not a good experience very disappointed ,0
i was excited to try this place for the korean bbq having wandered past a few weeks before the welcome we received should have given some warning signs of the experience we d receive on arrival it took five minutes for the staff to acknowledge us at which point we were asked to wait for a table this was fine however we then sat for 30 minutes before being shown to a table which was vacant when we had arrived half an hour prior we d browsed the menu whilst waiting so were ready to order but had to wait another 20 minutes to place our order successive staff members telling us there was only one member of staff who could take orders whilst ordering we were then informed that the restaurant was cash only so i had to wander to the local tesco to get enough cash to cover the meal a 20 minute wait at a busy cashpoint was not ideal but made little difference as our food took a good 45 minutes to arrive anyway i love a seafood pajeon pancake this was the first of our order served the miss korea version was unusually heavy and relatively tasteless a disappointing start our bbq options then arrived this was better a good portion of pork belly which we struggled to finish the experience however was affected again by the service a surly member of staff repeatedly messing with the temperature controls without explanation and removing all food on the bbq to a plate again without explanation it turns out to replace the grease proof paper on the grill we also had to ask at least five times to have a glass of tap water delivered to the table it eventually arriving at the end of the meal overall a very disappointing experience i don t think we ll be back the food a pale imitation of decent korean cuisine and some of the worst service i ve received for a while ,0
it took 45 minutes for them to serve us never coming back food quality didn t make up for the wait either ,0
amazing service the waiters were absolutely lovely it looked great and the dishes were really tasty the kimchi pancake was the best i have ever tried we also enjoyed the tteokbokki and the bulgoki the bibimbap was slightly disappointing but the overall experience was brilliant also nice music ,1
but the place dis not meet our expectations the service was very slow and rather rude they accept only cash it was so cold inside the restaurant so we had to wear our jackets ,0
was excited to visit miss korea as i love korean food the food itself was alright but the service was so slow ,0
i m a korean but i wasn t able to feel korean food in this restaurant i think the owner is a chines so the taste towards more on chines style than original korean i had soybean paste stew and bibimbab the stew was so salty and less ingredient i think if they put more tofu or other vegetables in the stew it would be better and my friend said the bibimbab has to much rice and less vegetables and meats maybe i can make better dishes than this restaurant also i don t know why they are only available cash i had to withdraw money from near atm 버밍엄에 한식당이 많이 없어서 기대 했는데 종업원들도 중국인이고 한식을 잘하는 식당은 아닌것 같습니다 된장찌개가 짠맛밖에 없어요 비빔밥은 찌개보다 먹을만한데 같이 간 친구는 밥을 정말 많이 남겼어요 ,1
i would say that they dont really have much options the service is great the place is beautiful but then the options were less ,0
fantastic little find thought the food was excellent and service brilliant especially for only 2 people covering a busy friday night we had set menu 2 with meat and veg excellent value for money in both quantity and quality chefs are having their summer break soon but will definitely be visiting again once they are back ,1
we spend a few days in birmingham we drove for like 3 hrs n a half to arrived then we straight went for miss korea for dinner it was good love korea food the kimchi pancake was good as well as the soup with rice ,1
great food very well served only 2 problems is cash only and they don t bring the good all st the same time ,1
i ve always eaten here because i like the ambience of the restaurant it looks way better than typical restaurant in most china town i ve also always loved eating korean foods so no matter which restaurant i order it from i m still gonna like it however the staff needs more training as they all seemed to be young student girls with no experience in customer service once you have your food on your table they don t ask you anymore whether everything is okay or not one time i had to call the attention of the waitress for 3 times and she still didn t come to our table because they were busy showed they were short of staff too and can t handle busy shifts i saw the manager i assume she is lowkey telling off the waitress when she didn t know the name of the food she was serving there were times too when the food order took so long to arrive on the table and not at the same time they ll bring one after the other again it showed slow service from the kitchen like i said i love korean foods but the service in this restaurant needs improvement oh i was surprised when i saw that they charge you for service charge when you don t get the service you deserve to get anyway ,1
was taken for a mother s day meal what a meal if was we waited at least after hour before being dealt with was told we would need to pay by cash despite seeing others pay with card we ordered drinks before my daughter went to the cash point i waited and the staff served the other familes arounf us despite us being seated first did not want to bring the drinks out until she was back it was across the road in view of the restaurant the food it s self over cooked tough under seasoned and plain tasting was not enjoyable at all the service was appalling it was like we was a burden to them the it was a shambles out starters we were brought one starter out of 3 and it took another 25mins before it was received we had our mains before our starter arrived ended up just paying for what was ordered and leaving still hungry disappointed ,0
fresh meat you can bbq yourself on your table i would say the only problem with this place is they accept cash only ,0
tucked in a corner of chinatown this little slice of korea was almost empty when we arrived at 12 15 the waitress was swift to warn us that they were cash only but luckily there was a cash point in the tesco express just up the road by 12 45 the place had filled with chatter even the large banquet table down the middle was full reassuringly the majority of diners were korean and we were only 1 of two tables with westerners on it the menu was all in english and the waitresses were quick to take our orders and very helpful we ordered samgyupsal belly pork bbq soy bean soup and kimchijeon kimchi pancake the kimchijeon came first unusually it seemed to have been deep fat fried and so had a slightly crisp coating but still tasted quite good the soy bean soup was good though a little low on chillies the samgyupsal was somewhat disappointing rather than the thick meaty strips of the home country this was more reminiscent of bacon thin and overly fatty despite that it was an enjoyable meal coming to 32 00 for the three dishes plus sides and drinks is certainly go back to see how the other food compares ,1
visited today with family attended chinese new year celebrations short wait for table one member of staff very helpful not had korean food before barbecue looked good food piping hot starters arrived separately few minutes apart although were very busy not bad first time eating experience some of waiting staff indifferent waited ages to pay only after we were seated and had ordered drinks were we told cash no cards ,1
evening meal with a work colleague very good food and authentic korean menu the meal just felt a little rushed with starters brought out separately and mains before starters had been finished would 100 eat here again ,1
me and my friends went for lunch and it was a great day the staffs are wonderful very friendly and attentive particularly the filipino lady who served us the food was delicious and we had a wonderful experience ,1
love this place i visit here monthly and love the veggie options kimchi pancakes are delicious so in the tofu soup hotpot and bimbwa ,1
reception was okay and they were very helpful not sure if this was because it was a sunday but i am old and experienced enough to know my good was heated and not cooked fresh my husband had a bibimbap which looked fresh and maybe should have ordered that was recommended miss korea by a colleague and this place is nothing to write home about sorry ,0
the food was fresh good value and really tasty the restaurant is on the edge of china town it is clean tidy and pleasant waitress was friendly polite and attentive it has a car park directly opposite ,1
food was nice when we got it starter missed firstly then a main missed which came with rice which had to ask for again ,1
came here for lunch on a saturday and had a great meal between the two of us we tried the pork gyozas and basically had the bbq we chose the beer lamb bbq beef and the beef ribs all very tender once on the bbq the ribs were a bit chewy though our bill came to around 40 and included two bowls of rice and some soft drinks overall highly recommended if you re a beginner to korean food the only downside is that the ventilation isn t great so you do end up smelling like your food ,1
poor service staff cannot manage waited a long time to order in spite of calling out to staff apparently there is only one staff who can take order after a long time she then came take the order of another group who came after us when this was pointed out she said that she would need to ask her boss who came first absolutely disgraceful needless to say we walked out there are other korean places to eat in birmingham avoid ,0
their pork bbqs are tender and delicious but i really don t like the fact that we have to order extra for lettuces because lettuces are complimentary for korean bbq in most restaurants i have visited side dishes have to order separately and not free kimchi soup came with complimentary rice bowl though the taste of other foods are quite okay but not as good as the one i went at manchester the decoration is nice and the staff is friendly only cash is accepted ,0
the restaurant is very nice the service sometimes a little bit slow but friendly and helpful i liked the beef tartare it s amazing the portions are quite big and few times i asked for a doggy bag they had no problem with that and were very organized nice place to have good food and nice atmosphere ,1
we enjoyed the food tempura was delicious comfy chairs bibimbap was nice good service will visit again ,1
we wanted to go somewhere different as a family for father s day lunch and a friend recommended here i always read reviews beforehand and so we knew about the cash situation and that service tended to be slow we got there when it opened at noon and so service was not at all slow we were the only customers for a while it gave us time to ask lots of questions about the food and the numerous options two of us chose the cook yourself bbq option and two had terryaki dishes the beef terryaki was delicious and it was a novelty to cook on the grill the rest of the food was good verging on ok we didn t appreciate the additional tax added onto the bill but had been very happy with our young waitress and the service she provided probably won t rush back but wouldn t rule it out either,0
accept cash only long waiting time pricey compared to other korean restaurant nearby no ventilation at the shop bad customer service we asked whether we could change our seating area cause the sun keep facing at my seating area been refused and no apologies we were so disappointed with this simple request as there were still plenty of seating table available at that time we have to end up take away all our foods and went to somewhere else to have our dinner would not recommend and would not ever go there again ,0
me and a friend were feeling adventurous in trying out a new cuisine we passed miss korea as an off chance thought we would try it first up was the korean tea very much an acquired taste too woody for me we ordered an appetizer to share belly pork with kimchi which was rather a large dish i felt it would have been better served with rice or noodles as it had a rich salty spicy taste to eat alone the main courses were chicken bibimbap and seafood udon noodles both dishes were very tasty and filling the bibimbap was an unusual dish as it is a very hot stone clay pot with rice at the bottom topped by vegetables and meat of your choice then a raw egg the idea is to mix it all together before you eat it almost as if you are stir frying the dish our waitress was very helpful and informative about the dishes we asked about the downside was cash only which we did not know until we asked for the bill ,1
korean food seems to becoming more and more fashionable these days i especially like how there are so many vegetarian vegan options on offer at this restaurant and it was very clean and comfortable the toilets are fun a cat meows whenever you open the door this type of quirkiness is what makes south east asia so fascinating my tofu was fantastic and just spicy enough staff were so cute and smiley too we were the only white people in there which is a testament to how authentic this place is we would definitely return the next time we are in birmingham especially as the hippodrome theatre is down the road ,1
i been coming to miss korea restaurant since late 2013 and every single time that i come here the food is consistent the standards are high the staff is friendly as well as helpful there isn t much korean restaurants in birmingham england this is a treat who want to try something different other than chinese japanese indian or thai food korean kimchi stew is very healthy kimchi itself is one of the healthiest foods on earth it based on fermentation of different vegetables the most popular one is with cabbage ,1
celebrated my birthday here there was 20 of us seated just fine only one lady server initially then the second lady came after an hour fantastic service and food is served excellently will definitely come back again price is a bit high but went with great satisfaction ,1
bad food even worse service they only take cash due to evading tax probably ordered a lamb meal and it tasted gross i barely touched it so i complained to the waitress and she could not speak much english and apologised but kept checking with the owner what they could do and all they could offer was 15 off our bill which is a complete rip off as my food arrived 30 mins after my friend has had his food no apologies about this whatsoever after a while the owner came out very rude and arrogant saying they do not care if we don t like the taste of the food as to them it tastes okay they tasted my leftovers as well wtf horrible experience i will not be coming back ever probably will put a formal complaint as well after how we were treated ,0
1 lots of people seated extremely slow service it isn t bad it is just slow once seated wait 5 10 minutes for drinks order wait for drinks 5 10 minutes another 15 20 minutes wait for food order raw bbq yourself orders will obviously get theirs quicker possibly another 25 30 minutes additional wait for the cooked food we opted for all cooked so first 2 people ate theirs whilst other 2 watched once finished still a wait before the other 2 people were even served 2 food was tasty and portions we thought were good 3 cash only 4 there are separate booths and tables for 4 the row of tables down the centre all squeezed together so you may be next to strangers the seats are comfy and the atmosphere is lively and you will likely be socialising with your own company anyway 5 you your clothes coats will come out smelling of bbq oil grease chilli etc the vents up above in the ceiling might not be doing anything useful at all would recommend going if you have lots of time want to try different flavours on your palate and want a different experience of cooking whilst socialising and eating next time we come we ll choose our clothes wisely ,1
don t understand the 10 tax or i think it s a tip added because they accept cash only the food is in small portion so need to order loads ,0
had a good night here with the family kimchi was spicy and delicious on the bbq the spicy pork was our favourite soups had lots of flavour prices were fine not cheap but no big shock when bill arrived negatives there is no extraction system so the place is full of bbq smoke clothes will smell after and like other reviewers noted the service charge is hidden it is put on the bill as tax rather than service and the waitresses are vague when ask them if service is already included or not it is ,0
had a lovely bowl of bibbimap full of flavour excellent starters too quick efficient service we did come out smelling of oil though it lacks a bit of atmosphere but i don t mind that we only wanted a quick bowl of something we weren t looking for a full on dining experience worth popping by if you re in the area ,1
food were small portions and the price were expensive the waitress said they only receive cash after i have placed an order so my friend had to go to the cash machine we had korean bbq and the ventilation system was poor the toilet light was very dark ,0
this was my first visit for quite a while and since it has been refurbished mid evening on a friday night we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated the new grills seemed easy to use and the waitress fired it up as soon as we ordered we piled in with beef prawns omelette seafood tempura and kimchi it was great watching our prawns and beef griddle while we supped on beer and korean tea which has overtones of vanilla we got lettuce with the beef which made it great to make beef barbecue sauce and kimchi parcels the omelette pancake was every bit as good as i had hoped after seeing judy joo make one on a tv programme the prawn fish and vegetable tempura were delicious crispy with firm flesh and even better when dipped in soy sauce the kimchi was really fiery there was far too much to eat but they kindly boxed the leftovers for us the waitresses are friendly and efficient it surprises me that so few brummies visit this place most of the clientele were oriental the food is delicious and 56 was not too bad considering how much we ordered with parking just across the road i don t know why you haven t visited highly recommended ,1
me and my friends visited this restaurant last friday all of the dishes just taste like putting the spicy bean paste on it would not recommend if you are really craving for real korean food ,0
first person experience in korean restaurant with a friend though expert in korean food the bbq was great the service though very slow ,0
loved this place different and friendly staff kids enjoyed helping grill the food at our own table a new and fun food experience ,1
we visited this place one year ago and left unimpressed then this time we arrived as a group of four for our meal and after ordering our food service initially started very well we got our drinks and the dishes started to arrive but after some time we were ignored our requests for drinks were ignored and after the first 3 4 dishes we ordered we had to wait 15 20 mins for the remainder of the dishes to arrive it was then we noticed that the place wasn t that busy but they were serving dishes to the other tables that had arrived after us the bbq and seafood pancake was delicious and the bibimbap and teriyaki eel was passable but the worst of all was the soft tofu stew it was nothing like we had ever tried before it was lacking in flavour and was more like a clear soup with bits of tofu cucumber and one egg in it at the end when we asked for the bill we were also slapped with a 10 tax at the end for poor service we didn t complain but this is one place we will definitely not be coming back to keep in mind this place serves bbq but has no ventilation system installed so it also becomes very stuffy and smoky you will definitely leave the place smelling of bbq and smoke ,0
heard about this place quite a while ago and i ve heard good reviews so decided to take a visit with the family not much of a big place and the food was okay quite overrated service took a while mains came before the starters and even when we ve finished our mains the starters still hasn t come out they forgot our orders and the staff seemed disorientated some of the bbq meat were good and the rest were taste less seafood platter was okay fresh the potato pumpkin veg platter came out after we had the meat and seafood platter so we sat there eating grilled veg the spicy fried chicken was really good and the decor of the restaurant is pretty but apart from that it was mediocre ,1
i don t get why some of this cluster of restaurants can be so empty on a saturday night while others are brimmed anyway this place is in the latter category and it s easy to see why i ve never been to korea so i can t vouch for the authenticity but it s well worth a visit the staff are very helpful and happy to walk you around the dishes this is quite useful as some of the dishes a either quite spicy or served raw they re also happy to anglosise a dish for you too if what they re serving is a bit weird for you every table is equipped with a barbecue grill too and this looks fun i m not sure where some of the expensive reviews come from on ta 34 quid for 2 people with sides drinks and starters is pretty good what do you want for your money and the service was excellent especially for a busy saturday night cash only ,1
i wish i had written a review on here a long time ago first i have to address the pearson who claims that miss korea restaurant is racist nothing could be further from the truth the people who owned miss korea restaurant are a interracial couple i been dining here nearly three years and as a black pearson i had nothing but excellent service at miss korea restaurant and been here today is no different the other diners are very well behaved the food at miss korea is delicious very healthy for the first time i tried cold buckwheat noodles and it was very nice the old saying is don t knock it until you tried i want to move to south korea if the food at miss korea restaurant is to go by please ignore the negative comment about it racist and unfriendly staff that pearson who wrote that isn t a regular where as i am ,1
bad poor service one waitress didn t inform us cash only food not a proper grill coz cooked into the top of piece of paper,0
i came here on monday and i have to say the food is amazing we had 3 dishes and i couldnt fault anything the staff very so friendly it was a pleasure to go in ive walked past several times on the weekend and there is always a que to get in so i would suggest a week night i will definatly be returning soon,1
warning this restaurant serves average food with really bad service soup has loads of msg bbq meat is either too salty or bland staff don t understand english well i asked to serve my main course after bbq but they brought all out at the same time and right when we were about to finish bbq lettuce leaves were out to the table i would have been better off eating in a top restaurants in birmingham with what i paid ,0
bad service miss korea the worse restaurant ever which i walked out a restaurant first time in my life been there before they refurnished just been in again after long time only few tables and not busy at all very rude staff who don t even be bother answer question and smile and gave you an awkward face constantly took her 2 seconds to repeat the order which don t even allow you to ask her to repeat again she claimed herself as manager which i don t believe she is and i openly said to her well you obviously failed your life and will stuck here forever then i just walked out a restaurant for the first time in my life very very bad restaurant strongly not recommend anyone to go there it will totally ruin your night out ,1
toppoki was full so went here the smell of cooking hit me as i went in and there was a smokey haze in the place all the tables were full so we were asked to wait at a table and given menus the service was ok and the food was nice but there were a lot of people barbecuing and the atmosphere got thicker and thicker when we left all the windows were steamed up and the smoke haze was quite thick don t go here in decent clothes or before going on to an event ,0
food was pretty good but the price was a little steep good customer service however we did get something that we did not order ,1
went here while visiting birmingham for lunch and my nephew recommend this place had to walk 20 mins from the car parking but worth doing so there were lots of parking available opposite this restaurant too live barbecue was lovely all food were very delicious and portion sizes are good we all enjoyed a lot lovely place could do a better in service we were not even asked how our food was in the entire meal sessioin but still charged extra as a service charge or don t know what it only said tax but if you charge extra for the service you have to up your game in sevice i felt so ovderall very good food will be back soon ,1
used to go here a lot but then found toppoki which we like toppoki was rammed last night so decided to venture further down the road again and i m glad we did mk has been refurbished and is very smart the waiting staff certainly aren t korean but the service was warm and friendly the food was top notch we really enjoyed the bbq and bibimbap was super tasty only criticism would be lack of extraction in the restaurant the new bbqs don t give off much smoke now electric and not coal as before but when they do smoke the only answer is for them to open the door ,1
lots of options in the area interesting place where you can cook your own meat under the barbeque section i tried the beef which comes raw in a hot pot you stir it and the more you do the more the beef gets cooked in the heat something different to what i ve had anywhere before the food was decent i tried the eel also which was tasty ,1
i m a big fan of korea food and i love the food here such as bibimbub tokpoki and kimchi jikae also bbq is very delicious even though your hair and cloth will have permanent bbq smell ,1
a friend and i had never eaten korean before and wandered into miss korea on the off chance we would enjoy it the restaurant itself is not the poshest in the world and if you re looking for intimacy then it s not really the place for you but it is nicely decorated the seats are comfortable and there s a friendly hubbub atmosphere the waiting staff were friendly and accommodating there was a wait for food but it was explained to us before we ordered so we didn t mind too much the food itself was tasty we shared dumplings and edamame to start then had black bean pork and noodles and bibimbap with a side of bean sprouts for main it was tasty with the exception of the bibimbap which came in it s own hot bowl the food wasn t as hot as i would expect but that s not to say it was unpleasant a lot of the menu is meat which you have to cook yourself on a built in grill on the table so i guess if you ordered that then your food would be super hot the reason the review is 4 and not 5 is that at the back of the restaurant there is some kind of function room or bar area which generated a lot of loud noise throughout our dining experience also where we were sat was directly opposite the door and every time anyone went in or out the door stays open so we were repeatedly having to ask for the door to be closed as it was really cold i understand the weather can t be helped and there are limited seats we hadn t booked so our table was probably one of the worst positions and if we had only had to ask once for the door to be closed i wouldn t mention it it was the fact that even though the staff knew we were cold when the door was open and were stood and could clearly see and feel the door was open they waited for us to ask before they closed it overall though a good experience ,1
celebrating a friends birthday so a small group keen to try something new we went for a set menu consisting of starters and main followed by ice cream starters was soup followed by something similar to dim sum this was lovely and there was plenty of it then came main course which consists of various meats vegetables and sauces which you cook for yourself using the hot plate in the centre of the table think fondue style bit of a novelty factor which soon wore off as i eat out for someone to cook for me good to try experience but if i went again i d get something else all of the food was lovely though ,1
this was the first time i came here we were just walking and decided to try the service started a bit slow but the food was delicious very good food here and i recommend this place,1
i gave this place a try as the other korean restaurant toppokki across the road in china town seemed too busy the food was absolute garbage from the frozen breaded prawn starters to a kimchi stew which tasted hideous i felt like i could taste tomato ketchup in the soup the service was pretty appalling had to go out of my way to get the attention of the waitress who was frowning the entire evening no authenticity horrible tasteless bland food which is nothing like korean home cooked food poor service if only i could give zero ratings ,0
in a nutshell food and soups were all plain and bland staff were not the friendliest restaurant suits couples and large groups i would encourage a family dining here ventilation is a major issue in that place price is not relative to the food quality nor dining experience very disappointed and will probably stick to topokki that s just round the corner on hurst st check out my review on them too wouldn t recommend at all ,0
i used to live in seoul so happy to find this place i recommend for the kids teriyaki chicken udon for us spicy squid bibimpap pork barbecue i give 5 stars for the delicious food they serve not for the average service ,1
this has been a good place for tasty food and i have visited it on a number of occasions in the past however of late there is something wrong with their ventilation which really affects the dining experience and what comes after it after a busy week i thought i d take the evening off and eat out to save time and work but ended up having to throw all of my clothes including my coat and my backpack into the wash i left the restaurant smelling very strongly of food due to the lack of air circulation and extraction also the floor tiles were so slippery that i nearly fell over which says something as i was wearing sensible shoes with non slip vibram soles other customers were similarly shuffling and sliding along in their sneakers to avoid slipping overall good food but not a relaxing experience and it created far more work than if i had stayed at home and cooked for myself ,1
have been there for several times and really love the food be ready to wait for the food because it took ages for the food to come except barbecue it has been a year since its reopening but they still accept cash only this is very annoying because they used the same excuse every time which was that there is a problem with the card machine connection to the server at the moment come on i ve been to the restaurant around 10 times since their reopening last year and they explained the cash only thing with the same excuse every time how could a card machine out of order for more than one year because they never actually use the card machine perhaps they re lying because of some particular reasons however the food is good hope it would accept card payments as soon as possible ,1
i took my family last friday evening for my anniversary meal something different i thought because we always go to cafe soya which i must say is excellent all started off well waitress was friendly explained the different meals we ordered then we waited 35 minutes for drinks then our meals came 1 after the other my wife s first after 50 minutes them mine 10 minutes later my children then waited a further 10 minutes for their meals it s not as if we ordered anything out of the ordinary it s was very annoying knowing my children were hungry me my wife had our meals eventually but they still hadn t had theirs the waitress said there was a mix up with the order which i couldn t understand because everything was from their menu numbered how easy could it be the place wasn t busy so there was no excuse at all the apologising during our meal got very irritating too cap it off the waitress apologised again then said they wouldn t charge the 10 service charge we couldn t wait too get out of there would never return the food is okay the portions are mediocre the prices are expensive for what it is but i will emphasise i will keep to what i know stick cafe soya in the future,0
i came to miss korea yesterday to celebrate my birthday with my partner and was really pleased with my choice the restaurant has a nice relaxing vibe and the food was outstanding would definitely come back soon ,1
coming from asia and now living in birmingham i enjoy eating asia food a friend advised me about this restaurant but i was sceptical about hi raving on it had an authentic korean barbeque best i have had in europe totally love it suggest f you want to go book or go early it is always full since i have been first time i have revised 2 more times and cannot recommend it more,0
we went as friends recommended it and trip advisor suggested it was good no poor service with incomplete meals and the quality of the food some of it self cooked at the table was different expensive for what we had 75 for four with a drink each and one course note the bill includes a 10 service charge ,1
this is a fabulous place you can t phone and book but you can go in and reserve a table on the night very busy basic style but food great there was eight of us we had a set menu for four people twice there was more food than we knew what to do with reasonably priced as well ,1
first time i ve had a korean meal came across this place on tripadvisor and read the reviews as protocol the place was only 30metres from where i was so took a look with my own eyes when it comes to eating out the number one thing that friends ask me is where can i get good indian food i m of indian origin and my answer is always the same wherever you see indian people eating i followed my own advice and opted to dine at miss korea as this is where koreans were eating they have the raw menu where you can cook your own meat on the built in grill on your table like a self serve teppan yaki but my friends and i opted for the cooked choices we enjoyed a smokey chicken teriyaki sizzling on the iron plate the sweet and spicy chicken veg noodles and the some of the crispiest tempura in a light and fresh batter sides of cucumber relish and kimchi to not cloud the flavour we stuck with water as it was our first experience of korean cuisine we thoroughly enjoyed the meal and at the end we took guesses as to the bill it came in under a third under our estimates full of flavour and excellent value goes to show you have to try things and make your own opinions ,1
the restaurant offers typical korean restaurant dishes than home food overall the food is delicious though a bit pricy ,1
the food tastes great and the staff are helpful it was nice to have unlimited refills of korean tea visiting was an enjoyable experience ,1
we had high hopes and expectation for the place and it did not disappoint us at all the flavours were good and we loved the bbq dishes we have been craving for we ordered a portion of the raw beef yuk hwae and wow thanks to other reviewers we were dressed prepared for the smoky bbq environment and had we not been warned we would have been pretty annoyed if we had turned up in our sunday best only to find we needed to literally strip as we walked into our home and everything went into the wash and bodies in the shower however if you are prepared it really is worth it the only criticism is the excuse of the card machine being still out of order we wondered if it had ever worked we thought it would have given a better impression to simply state cash only up front as it would not deter us from eating there again at all the food itself is enough to draw in customers ,1
seen this from day one for a few years shopfront looks good but find it hard to appreciate the experience and food first thing the food is a bit pricey if you want the grill it can be a bit expensive korea food seems to be a growing trend nowadays but not really for me food is okay and will not blow you mind ventilation could be a lot better with many tables grilling you end up coming out with your clothes smelling of oil similar to my friday night at the local kebab shop ,1
having just returned for south korea i can say this place is a great traditional restaurant the service was perfect and the food was delicious we had some korean bbq kimchi and all the trimmings you would expect with korean even has korean beers and soju highly recommend to go with your food ,1
wonderful authentic kimchi and glass noodles and table bbq is great fun if you don t mind smelling a bit smokey after decor and service are excellent but loos were a bit messy on my visit ,1
the best thing about this restaurant is the bbq at the table it is worth a visit just for that reason as is unusually food we orderd from the menu was ok lacked flavour certainly the soup we felt other foods was slightly over priced for the lacking quality in the menu food however the staff were friendly and the area was clean and tidy not sure we would visit again ,1
today i was craving for korean food for lunch and so after my friend s recommendation and all the positive reviews i ve decided to hive miss korea a try it was the only reason why i went to the city centre today and i was excited upon entering the restaurant i ve noticed the nice yet simple decor i find it very cosy i was greeted with a hello by the waitress i sat and checked on the menu that looks sumptuous i was very hungry i couldn t wait to order and feast it took quite a few minutes before my order was taken even though it was quiet today i ve ordered for kimchi jap chae and beef bulgogi bibimbap come the drinks i asked for korean tea however i was told that their bar is closed ok i opt for sprite with loads of ice but then i was told they have no ice at this point miss a starting to feel a bit annoyed alright then i can do without ice i stood up to go to the toilet and the waitress had another news for me there is no light in the toilet and even said that if i want i can use my mobile phone as a light how unacceptable by this time i ve already lost my appetite closed bar no ice then no light in the toilet to top it all i was told they only accept cash payment as their card machine is broken what an appalling service i got today that broken card machine has been their issue for quite some time now does it really take long to fix it i ve told the waitress that it has been terrible experience i ve had with them today and since my appetite has already been spoilt i left the restaurant without tasting their food i m not even sure if i would come back to try it i was very disappointed and quite frankly i don t care if a restaurant s food is good if the service is bad then i shall never go back nor will i recommend it to any of my friends i ended up in toppoki which is just on the other side and i ve enjoyed their food very much ,0
we popped here for dinner and the food was all lovely teriyaki salmon and beef and gyoza and spicy chicken to start a watermelon juice was also very refreshing only problem is the bbq makes you smell of cooking when you leave maybe better ventilation would help ,0
129 14 47 127 15 08 128 9 56 we went to miss korea in birmingham for the first time to see what korean food was really like we ordered a range of starters and main courses which included bbq beef marinaded in beer which you was have to grill yourself also thier was raw beef bin bargan which tasted lovely the selection of starters and mains were excellent the service was good food came to moderate timings the drinks were lovely and light i went for korean crushed pear drink which tasted excellent and fizzy the atmosphere was comfortable ,1
we decided to have lunch and my boyfriend suggested this place it was both our first time as soon as we get in the restaurant is very modern and clean i like that it looks like a very chill place to have lunch to our waitress gave us this massive menu and decided to go for their lunch menu as soon as our food arrived it exceeded my expectations it had a wonderful presentation and was very delicious the price is very good too and i will definitely come back next time i will try the korean bbq only down side i think is you stink a bit of bbq cos of other tables cooking wouldnt recommend going to this place if heading out after ,1
i have missed samgyupsal since leaving korea so far this is the best restaurant that i have found serving this dish i have been a few times over the last few years and have never been disappointed i was shocked at paying for my side dishes after having lived the korean way where this is all free but the price was worth it would definitely go again ,1
i can honestly say this is the best korean food i have had in birmingham however they need to sort out there air system as you stink of food when you leave get an extraction system in place also been here a few months ago and still the credit card issue remains they keep saying the system doesn t work seems to me they don t want to pay the card machine fees it s 2015 people get a grip other than this i still love this place the food is excellent and the service is friendly this is my third time back ,1
two meats beautifully marinaded one in beer the other sweet great kimchi too service faultless as before unhurried sat afternoon meal with just enough to eat if you re confused what to order the staff give great advice fast becoming a favourite place to eat ,1
nice place with friendly staff a good choice of menu options including korean bbq or dishes that are ready cooked we opted for rice based dishes plus a selection of vegetable starters which were all tasty this was our first korean restaurant and the spicy fried chicken with rice is definitely a dish i would want again not expensive and very generous portions i ve no doubt we ll be back ,1
this is our second visit we visited last year and it was much better this time around will be coming back again very soon ,1
having eaten korean before on a visit to hong kong i knew roughly what to expect marinated meat dishes to be cooked on a hot grill thing in the centre of the table and kimchi the ubiquitous korean cabbage pickle and so it was delicious must go back ,1
had heard great things about this place and the menu had us drooling when we arrived the staff were welcoming and there was a nice buzz to the place we ordered a drink whilst we waited for our pals but by the time they had joined us and finished their drink too we had to leave unfortunately we were overwhelmed by the odour the problem is that this place is korean bbq so you cook your own food at the table sounds like a great idea but not when there is little or no ventilation we were there for less than 30mins but our clothes stank of fried food oil for the rest of the night considering this is a fairly new venue it is not going to smell any better with time especially with the wood paneling and cloth covered chairs a commercial kitchen is not allowed to open without proper ventilation so i have no idea how this place remains open without the same in the dining room such a shame ,0
i love korean food so much and korean bbq in particular we went here a little tipsy and left more that satisfied i had a gochujang marinated pork dish which i had to barbecue on the in table grill my wife had a huge bibimbap with giant pieces of tofu on top and our friend visiting from the usa had a authentic kimchi and tofu soup sundubu chiggae incredible food experience ,1
my boyfriend and i discovered this gem last week we had a set menu as korean food is not familiar to us and it was fabulous the seafood one we both thoroughly enjoyed it and i ve been recommending it to all our friends in the area well worth a visit finally something a bit different and i love the grills in the tables ,1
this new restaurant provides to my mind authentic korean flavours and dining experiences i am no expert but have a little knowledge of korean food having visited the country about 20 times i was told that the chef is korean and this was borne out in the flavours i enjoyed in my lunchtime bulgogi bibimpap a few days ago the melon juice was typical of the kinds of accompaniment one enjoys with korean food and the kimchee pickled spicy cabbage really did take me back to a country i have enjoyed visiting over many years the restaurant was very quiet when we viisted but this was just before the start of the university terms in nottingham nottingham s 60 000 new and returning students or at any rate some of them no doubt will give the place a bit of atmosphere shortly there was only one non korean waitress serving when we visited but this no doubt reflects the fact that we were there at lunchtime at a quiet time of the week i would say however that the confident manner in which korean waiters and waitresses serve and talk about the food it is their job to bring to you is another very nice aspect of restaurants in korea if this place can manage it it should hire some korean waiting staff it would provide even more genuineness in the dining experience the only thing i really quibble however with is the name of the restaurant viewed either as referring to a yearning for visiting korea or to a beauty pageant it is slightly cheesy something that speaks to you of korea s ancient culture in my view would be more appropriate this is a small reservation about a generally good restaurant that i intend to visit again ,1
i think this place is great the atmosphere is very relaxed thr waitresses are great very smiley and understanding the food was great however it was pretty expensive,1
the service is one of the worse i even questioned myself what had i done to make the waitress treat my table with so much hatred but i guess she did that to every customer she didnot say a word or understand anything we asked she gave us cold stares the food is no where compare to toppoki the other korean restaurant i think because the chefs are not koreans my friends live near the restaurant its the only reason we came there so often the size was small pricey and not authentic the best dish is bibimbap that is the only compliment i can give,0
my second visit to a hidden treasure nice modern decor without being ostentatious i love the barbecues recessed into each table allowing customers to cook their own food you can t get any fresher than that vegetable dumplings vegetable fritters and squid in spicy sauce followed by pork squid and prawns cooked on the barbecue fantastic quality food at a very reasonable price definitely one to check out and try again bring lots of friends,1
as other reviews have said the waiting service is poor this is mainly down to the poor attitude of the waitress with glasses there were several scenarios where arguments nearly broke out the food is average and i ve had better in london they do not have space for you to put buggies and it ends up near the door i did t feel comfortable with this ,0
i came down to birmingham for the day from london for business reasons and was craving some korean food after a hard days work but had no idea on where i could get some so then i contacted a few friends who resided in the city and asked for recommendations which then later they brought me to miss korea when we first stepped into the restaurant we weren t greeted my first impression of the interior was that it was immaculate and bold however it was quite smokey inside as there was an open kitchen but also meat being grilled on some customers table tops but that was understandable after being noticed a few minutes later we were then seated and decided to order 3 portions of bulgogi 1 portion of la galbi 1 portion of lettuce 2 portions of kimchi cabbage 1 portion of seasoned spinach 1 portion of dukbokki 1 portion of rice 1 portion o fkimchi fried rice and 4 drinks the food was of good quality but had it s flaws such as the dukbokki was quite over cooked which resulted in a really mushy texture the kimchi fried rice was quite on the dry side and also the portions were quite small compared to the price but that wasn t the problem the real problem was the staff and service firstly the female staff who was serving us was sulking for some reason and seemed like she didn t want to serve us her attitude towards us was like she didn t care about anything and just wanted to go home after our order was taken we had to wait rather long for our food to arrive and then when it finally arrived some dishes were missing for example the meats arrived but the lettuce and rice were nowhere to be found and it seemed that the waitress had forgotten about them which then i reminded her and she said i quote okay and left no apology whatsoever when we nearly finished the meat she then brings out the rice and lettuce and still no apology with then we decided to just finish quickly and leave as we didn t felt welcomed the food was of good standard but the price was a bit of the high side the staff and service however was the final killing blow that assured me to never come back to this restaurant and try else where ,0
i went there with my friend on friday night not busy much that time no greeting at the entrance but i can accept that as soon as we sat down the waitress came and lay out the cutlery my phone was on the table she just pushed the phone away to put the napkin on the table i was really surprised by her attitude and she noticed that too but no apology not at all hint dont know her name but there s only one girl with the band hair in front wearing gold necklace ,0
i can totally understand the service complaints as it is sometimes a hit and miss however the food is amazing we go so much the lady in the kitchen starts cooking our soup before we ve even ordered amazing i would say the male owner can add a bad vibe in there the girls are much better when his absent my review is based on the food which we love and the girls do a great job as well as the chefs little gem in birmingham,1
this was my first experience with korean food and i was excited to go since my friends hyped up miss korea to me the night before i have heard of bulgogi and kimchi and always wanted to try them so i was looking forward to the trip upon arrival we were seated at a table for four people with five of us the grill also appeared to be broken it took ten minutes of nervous whispering and attempting to flag down the waiting staff for us to be moved to a bigger table with a working grill the ordering felt rushed and we had to send away the waitress as we didn t feel ready and when she came back we had to rush a decision out of a feeling of awkwardness i was then told by a friend who had been here before that their kimchi is not authentic at all and would be a disappointment so i decided to forego it the food itself took a really long time to arrive with the first main arriving close to fifteen minutes before the last i found the starter sadly i forgot the name it looks like a deep fried pancake folded in half over some filling and my main bulgogi chicken with veg and rice in a hot stone bowl generally bland and even a tad sickening in taste the only redeeming quality of the main was the meat which was delicious but scarce on the other hand i really enjoyed the beef bulgogi and beer marinated beef that we could grill ourselves they were absolutely delicious but too felt like very little meat for 6 per plate as another review points out the service is terrible the waiting staff pay no attention to what goes around them we had to raise our voice to borderline shouting in order to get their attention from a meter away the two waitresses seem very timid and even scared another lady who appears to be their manager has a very hostile air about her made no effort to seem welcoming when talking to us and berated the two girls in the plain view of customers when they do appear the waitresses would come to the table take the utensils and stir the meat on the grill after seeing you do it before walking off without a word empty plates were not taken away from the table through the meal and once again the staff had to be almost shouted to in order to tell them that we would like our bill overall i wasn t very impressed with the restaurant apart from the novelty of the grill which i did enjoy as far as i understand the food isn t very authentic and isn t a great representation of quality of korean food the service is poor and i felt like i overpaid for the little food that i did eat i told my friends i stopped eating because i had enough and wasn t hungry any more whichever as true enough but the cause of that was a lack of appetite and not a full stomach the only reason i can see myself coming back to miss korea is for the grill meats and exclusively that ,0
came to miss korea on the recommendation of a good friend who accompanied me nice modern decor without being ostentatious my friend chose the menu and i was very pleased the starters of chicken dumplings and fried vegetables were nice and the edamame fresh but it was when the table top cooker was opened up and i was presented with freshly lightly fried pork squid prawns mussels and salmon i realised how good the cuisine was all of this at a bargain price i shall come back again,1
we ordered seafood bibimbap my favourite it has a special type of sauce in it which adds so much to the flavour deep fried tofu in sweet chilli sauce kimchi pork kimchi starter spinach starter all dishes are amazing very healthy fresh food spicy enough bit bot to blow one s mind off highly recommended my favourite korean restaurant in whole birmingham ,1
had better been to worse just don t expect fantastic would i come again yes but only because it is the only korean bbq around here ,1
miss korea is a breath of fresh air in birmingham it has great food and brings a uniqueness to the far eastern cuisine scene in nearby chinatown i have been here before with my husband last year and i would recommend it the decor is simple modern and black the staff are very friendly and the food was delicious ,1
we found ourselves in miss korea during the sunday chinese celebrations of the new year horse the food was good enough for us to eat it all however not memorable this maybe due to our love of vietnamese food and expected more flavors rather than miss korea s food itself ,1
ignore the haters lot of them their first review seems a bit fishy to me after discovering miss korea on a whim with a friend last november we have been twice more everytime we have had no problem getting tap water though usually alongside other drinks the bbq stuff is awesome the beef with ginger and soy is great the service is quiet and efficent which is the way i personally like it miss korea is one of my favourite spots to eat currently don t see that changing anytime soon ,1
location central directly opp arcadian car park atmosphere v friendly staff really welcoming it s quite modern but as though it s been done on the cheap so i wouldn t recommend as a romantic venue food i had never tried korean food and enjoyed the different flavours we didn t go for anything in the bbq menu where the meat is cooked at your table but wish we had given it a try all in all nice flavours fresh food a tad greasy give it a try ,1
me and my friends have a meal there we order barbecue the table is very small the waitress who has the black with a stink face to order and service us no smile no more words to introduce food i found that the plate is very oily i ask for tap water but the staff said they don t provide tap water to chinese but the manager is chinese after dinner we want to paid separately pay cash and card together the staff said we can t paid card less than 30 pound the manager seems not happy to see us trouble her coz the bill when we went out our coats are smelly their kitchen is opened no window ,0
having read some of the reviews we were quite anxious about eating at miss korea but we needn t have been the service was thoughtful and help was offered but not pushed the friends we went with had been several times before i really enjoyed the dish i had with eel as did one of our friends my partner had a beef dish and the other friend had tofu the kimchi and other side dish were very spicy but delicious and gave us something to nibble before our main dishes arrived drinks were good too i had a soya drink one friend had beer and the two men shared a spirit which whilst good at the time had rather an unfortunate hangover as an after effect probably best avoided we were not hustled or harassed and were able to enjoy a very happy evening chatting and enjoying good food we ll definitely return and hope to try some of the other dishes next time thank you miss korea ,1
went here with friends and for birthdays loved everything about it the food is amazing and at brilliant value would recommend for people who are curious about korean food,1
me and my wife visit birmingham to shop at the korean restaurant in selly oak then like to have a meal out somewhere we found this place through tripadvisor first time we went all seemed ok a little expensive for what is kimbab cheonguk meals but barring that food was ok went again today and food was of average quality and prices for the dishes seemed more expensive we ordered food and drinks including a seafood pancake which was way too small also the portions of bibbimbap were too small even my son 10 years old complained of being still hungry after the meal biggest shock was getting the bill 3 pounds for water and 2 pounds for a glass of warm sprite that had been served out of a 2 litre bottle from the supermarket seriously having lived and worked in korea for 6 years i know that you will never attain the same service standards as there but saying that charging for water in a korean restaurant as a lover of korean food i wont be going again sorry ,0
i thought we d give this place a try having been to two other korean bbq restaurants in the area of town looks okay from the outside and it wasn t busy plus the menu looked nice in the window we were quickly seated and set about choosing our food there is a good bbq selection but i fancied something different so we chose a couple of starters a side two mains and an extra this didn t take too long but then the waiting began there were two other couples and a table of around ten guys who were doing their own bbq and didn t need much assistance the kitchen seemed well staffed two girls serving but one was also doing the bar and the manageress was easily spotted in the kitchen too more waiting i haven t even been asked what i want to drink yet more waiting im getting impatient and annoyed now but i am still being ignored by the serving staff okay now i m angry and i decided in one minute i am going to get up and walk out 45 seconds in i get served we order everything and it doesn t take too long to come it all comes at different times and overall the food was very nice couldn t fault it but then the waiting starts again ive finished my drink and want another i even position the empty glass to the side of the table near the servers but it doesn t happen i wouldn t mind some dessert too but im still sat around waiting and getting impatient again and eventually i announce it and get up pay and leave luckily you pay at the counter and don t ask the waitress for a bill otherwise i would of been there much longer they missed out on me having another couple of beers and trying the korean rice wine plus a couple of desserts i wont go back again i did think about venting my anger at the manageress but she just looks at you from the kitchen and doesn t give any direction to waiting staff if it was busy then god help anyone wanting to get served i had to go somewhere else for pudding and a few beers and i wont go there again there are much better korean restaurants in the quarter so i would give miss korea a big miss ,1
after sharing a room with several korean ladies my daughter has a love for korean culture especially the food we try and find a good korean food when ever we travel together and closer to home as often as we can a weeks holiday and a rainy day was a good excuse to try out miss korea a bbq style place close to the cinema the decor is minimalistic with stainless steel and chrome predominated the food and staff were korean so my daughter said despite being a busy sunday lunchtime we were seated quickly the menus are in korean and english and coded in case you don t want to try and pronounce the names with colour pictures to give you an idea of what to expect a complementary small portion of spicy korean salad to start with was a good start we ordered kimchi chigae and bulgogi dolsot bibimbab and both of those were excellent my soup came bubbling hot and was full of flavour and spicy rice was included i would also recommend the jugs of fruit juice the mango we had was great it was good food at a good price under 30 for a meal with drinks and a starter a chain worth supporting ,1
i have been to miss korea twice i have also been to seoul south korea for long periods of time my best friend lives their many of the dishes are indeed authentic so people who say otherwise don t on trip adviser don t really know what they are talking about nice friendly restaurant with bbq facility in the center of each table allowing you to cook your own meal if you so desire its not a 5 restaurant so don t walk in there with high expectations of glitz and glamour or outstanding ritz table service the prices are reasonable and the service is absolutely fine i cannot understand such negative reviews from others god knows what these other people expect anyway you cant please everyone but this restaurant certainly pleases me each time i go looking forward to my next trip there angelo sutton coldfield ,1
totally wrong food there are all chinese staff very disappointed wasted time and money i will not go again ,0
i went last year when they first opened and had a very bad experience the wait for being served was long and the food came separately which caused us to eat at separate times we went this time thinking the service would have improved by now but it hasn t we were shown to the table after 5 minutes by the waitress whereas the owner chose to stand behind the bar watching the first dish came half an hour later and still no sign of drinks it was busy so it was understandable that the food would take awhile but we ordered around half 7 and only just had the main dishes served around half 8 9 the bbq was turned off so we asked the owner to check for us and then he told us the bbq on this table was broke and and he asked us to moved i questioned him why it took them so long to let us know that and he blamed it on the waitress he asked the waitresses and she confirmed that it wasn t brokenand then he pushed her away and got the kitchen to cook our meat inside overall it wasn t a very nice experience mainly because of the wait service and also the food doesn t taste as good as toppoki ,0
we decided to try this place for lunch on a quick trip to birmingham there were four of us our waitress was very helpful explaining and recommending dishes we had a selection of appetisers some meat that we bbq d in the pit on the table a broth dish and teriyaki salmon i have no idea how authentic it is but it was all delicious the gyoza were better than wagamama the other dishes were interesting and made a change from chinese japanese thai there was plenty of food but not too much it came to 61 which i thought was good value we only had soft drinks only point to improve was that the ladies loo could have been a bit cleaner ,1
miss korea is a small but smart looking little restaurant there is a detailed menu and lots to choose from it sounds like some people have had a bad experience but really in my eyes it was very positive the menu offers great choice but doesn t give you too much support if you re not familiar with korean cuisine that said it compared favourably to my previous experience with korean restaurants the food was quick well presented seasoned and flavoured and good value the drinks a little more expensive but not out of sync with other restaurants we didn t have any experience with the tap water but in fairness to them at least they re up front about it the service was attentive no waiting at all to be helped there was no checking in on your enjoyment during the meal which is a little unusual but really not an issue for me i would go again and would be happy to recommend it to others too ,1
 food is not authentic terrible service with just the one waiter not allowed tap water for the quality of food price was extortionate do not come you have been warned,0
we were going to see sleeping beauty at the hippodrome so wanted a quick but tasty pre theatre dinner spotted this on way into arcadian car park and thought we would give if a go restaurant had plenty of korean customers and we were the only europeans but we were made to feel very welcome staff were very helpful and we had three starters and two mains including a deep fried tofu starter and a spicy pork stew with kimche the pickled cabbage that seems to be very important to their cuisine we also had a glass of white wine and an iced lemon tea the food was delicious anf plentiful and the bill was 29 sorry to see some people had a bad experience here ours was fantastic and i can t wait to try it again ,1
i used to like this restaurant until today i ve been to miss korea more than 5 times in the past 1 years i like the food although it s a bit over priced today me and my wife ordered 4 dishes a ice cream and a coke everything is ok until i have the bill there re 2 more drinks on the bill strawberry milk shake j2o papaya totally 6 pounds which we never ordered in the meanwhile there s only one big empty cup on our table i asked waitress she realized immediately before i told her what happened she then went to modify bill and bring the correct bill back without a apology she seems not very happy about we checked bill carefully and found out what they did to our bill i asked some of my chinese friend they have the same experience of be given wrongly calculated bill i think they re doing this on purpose because what they add into bills are drinks which are their most profitable things in menu as people already mentioned before they don t serve tap water why as far as i can tell a big part of their profit are from drinks if you have a tap water which is free they earn nothing from their over priced drink eg a korean grape drink in miss korea 2 5 quid in 100 feet away chinese convenience store 50p now maybe you can see the reason why they don t serve any tap water avoid this restaurant if you can t be prepared that there won t be any tap water served carefully check your bill pro the food was ok con serve no tap water add drinks which you never ordered to bill stealthily,0
i travel to korea often on business so am fairly familiar with authentic korean food i was looking forward to eating here and seeing how the food in birmingham compared with seoul firstly none of the staff are korean not that this in itself is a bad thing but it would be nice to have some korean staff in a korean restaurant instead of all chinese all of the staff were friendly and efficient though so we had no complaints with the service i found the food to be a disappointment though while they had many of the normal korean favorites our food tasted very bland compared to authentic korean we ordered bulgogi which didn t come with any of the normal side dishes we even had to ask for lettuce if you had never been to a korean restaurant before then this place would be fine but if you ve already been exposed to proper korean food then you re probably going to end up disappointed ,1
from a korean s perspective i didn t find food at miss korea at all authentic or tasty i could have made a better bibimbap myself yuk kae jang tasted like mild beef stock kimchi jeon too sweet sam gyup sal tasted like cardboard i was surprised how kimchi jeon and hae mul pajeon were on desserts menu just because the english translation is kimchi pancakes and seafood pancakes doesn t mean they are dessert material far from it the waiter who served me wasn t familiar with the menu which made me having to point out the dishes one by one with my finger i was also appalled by how they refuse to serve tap water yes bad for their profit but shouldn t they still serve it if the customer wants it ,0
this is an interesting restaurant if you want to try something new my husband is gluten intolerant and the manageress doubled checked every dish was suitable before we ate the customer service was excellent there is a great selection of appetizers we had king prawns is spicy tempura batter pork dumpling soup with sweet and sour seaweed all delicious for mains we had spicy chicken and beef marinated in garlic chilli and sesame oil this we cooked on a bbq plate in the middle of the table or we could have cooked in the kitchen who knows any chef who would let you cook in their kitchen there are several dipping sauces that complimented the meat well we experienced and tasted new flavours great fun for all the family cost for 3 people 55 including drinks ,1
great to discover you can get tasty authentic korean food in birmingham good service and not expensive will be back for more ,1
with only one review for this restaurant and a bad one at that i didn t have high hopes but my wife really wanted to have some korean food before a concert symphony hall a 10min drive away so this is the only korean restaurant we could find in birmingham it has a car park directly opposite the restaurant is on the edge of china town and looks ok from the outside on entry its clean and tidy nothing glamourous but pleasant the menu is very korean i think although i think some of the staff were chinese not surprising in china town the menu had a heavy bbq component with the option to have bbq bucket on your table to cook the food or pre cooked by the chef we opted for the later as had limited time there were also the famous spicy cabbage dishes and soups a good idea was to have option of jugs for juice drinks at reduced cost which is good especially if your driving plenty of juices to chose from too the food was fresh plentiful good value and really tasty lamb skewers went down a treat as did the beef in beer and sliced pork dishes the only thing i could fault was no hand drier in the small gents toilet waitress was friendly polite and attentive would go again its a really good addition to the cuisine availble in birmingham china town ,1
i wanted some water for my 2 year old son and was refused after our meal i challenged the owner about refusing tap water and he said it was not healthy probably he meant not healthy for his profit margins disgusting attitude i am a huge fan of korean food and have tasted many wonderful dishes in korea itself this is without doubt the worst i have ever had the bulgogi tasted like a chinese stir fry and the bibimbap was just run of the mill and quite tasteless to add to our misery the owner had a tense and heated meeting with his staff a few tables away from us which made us feel uncomfortable it just shows how unconsiderate he is these meetings should take place behind closed doors and away from the public i felt ever so sorry for the korean cooks they looked so sad and downbeaten by the owner s bully approach birmingham really needs a korean restaurant this is not it and you will be wise to avoid it a huge disappointment ,0
went there since it was near the hotel we were staying and the reviews were okish the food didn t blow my mind off but offered a pleasant change brake from m eastern cuisine the spicy dishes were nice soup and rice cake with vegetables be aware if you need to take away some left overs chopsticks are not included this was surprising to me but anyway ,0
the food was average i found the management was quite rude to employee kimchi was very much below par ,0
looking from outside there is a sign which says amazing chicken on the wall there is another sign which says taste of korea one of the most underrated restaurants in the area food was amazing ,1
if you re in muscat and crave some authentic korean food then head right over without a doubt in mind the banchan served at the beginning of the meal is not of a huge selection but it is sufficient and tasty the vegetarian japchea is juicy and full of flavor we ordered kimchi jeon it comes in a number of small pancakes which were hot and yummy for the main meal we tried their ever famous half and half fried chicken and the stir fried spicy squid my only disappointment was they had no ice tea and no free after meal dessert which in my experience comes with every korean restaurant ,0
i just came back from my second trip to south korea and have had korean friends cook me yummy korean food this place is legit soups appetizers and main courses all are delicious you might find some small differences like beef in my soup was not thin strips but nonetheless very delicious with excellent flavor and plenty of herbs and mushrooms just like authentic soups i have had in korea rice was of good quality and cooked well ,1
my family and i travelled from nizwa to muscat just to dine here last friday for our dinner efforts paid off the restaurant has comfortable and quiet ambiance felt the kpop vibes our orders quickly served on the table excellent korean dishes we loved every bit of it reasonably priced friendly and helpful staff the restaurant is clean location is good we really enjoyed dining here our new favorite restaurant if visiting muscat ,1
bit expensive but food is ok for a change though it s nothing extra ordinary located in a bit of a crowded place so indoor dining advice ,1
came here with a friend who has lived in korea and loves his korean food the restaurant is small and simply decorated the food is very good and i certainly enjoyed all the side dishes as well as my main dish of rich and vegetable ,1
nice food very delicious my friend enjoyed also place its cozzy and comfortable the price its very affordable for the delicious food the staff also are so friendly ,1
i like korean food that is why i decided to go to this restaurant despite so many arabic indian and turkish restaurants to try from and i was happy with my decision i had the ramen noodles spicy and quite a big bowl noodles were just right fresh vegetables along came the mandatory korean side dishes all of them tasty kimchi included very nice and attentive waiter place is modern neat and you have k pop music to go with it together with korean music videos on the tv screen i did not try other food but left with a full stomach and satisfied give it a try i am certain there is other good stuff as well ,1
i wasn t planning on korean food during a short stay in muscat but it was right across the street from our hotel midan and the good reviews here made it seem like a good bet we were not disappointed the service was very friendly and the atmosphere while not fancy was very clean and comfortable the marinated beef grilled at your table was tender and delicious along with all the normal bitesize side dishes we had the mixed chicken and preferred the soy sauce to the sweet but both were very good the surprise best item was the ramen soup a spicy but not too delight would definitely go back ,1
food and service was great we missed korea and were pleasantly surprised by how authentic was food everything delicious and portions were huge ordered stir fry squid korean spicy cold noodle difficult to find it s sort if behind construction site ,1
visited taste of korea for dinner this evening with my husband it s a little difficult to find but the food is worth the effort it s an easy 15 minute walk from the chedi hotel this was our first experience of korean food but the menu was simple to follow the waiter guided us with the amount of food to order we went for one of the fried boneless chicken specials which was described as sweet spicy to accompany this we had the fried vegetable rice we were also served a number of side dishes of various textures tastes including miso soup we really enjoyed our meal which was really tasty really reasonably priced at 10 rials we would have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant to all ,1
recommended to try for korean taste good place nice food clean environment and friendly staff worth to try ,1
after the wife suggested korean for the first time ever and we googled it this place came up with mixed but mainly good reviews even right here on trip advisor we though we d give it a go after driving around gulf hotel apartments twice i had to get out of the car to walk around a little but eventually found it location could be better however that s all made up for when you try the food small premises but comfortable ambiance a little lacking as well and the food quality actually deserves a better more fitting authentic korean mood in a nicer more accessible premises anyway to the food we ordered the marinated korean bbq beef the mixed spicy sweet chicken the kimche rice and vegetable rice the order came with an amazingly zestful tasty cold soup and a lot of sides and sauce from the moment this stuff hit my tastebuds i was in heaven and i have now added korea to one of those places one must visit before they die if only just for the food fragrant aromatic mouth watering and satisfying we will definitely be back don t care what the naysayers have to say friendly staff however a little on the pricey side reduction of prices or family group offers would greatly increase the traffic i highly recommend it and i m a fussy bugger,1
i tried to eat korea food at amazing chicken it is very delicious and clean inside absolutely i will visit again there is very nice place i recommend to visit there,1
noticed this place few months back and after a friend recommended it i decided to try it last week called them and got the map on whatsapp ambience is minimal we were the only diners on a weekday at 8 30pm ordered a chicken salad which was nice and a kimchi fried rice which comes with a lot more side dishes like pickles etc we also got a soup radish with it we didnt like the fried rice as we found it bland might give the other apetizers a try next time ,1
had the combination chicken half is sweet other half is soy together go great it is big enough to share we also ordered some fried rice which was really nice too ,1
this is the only restaurant available for koreans in this area the food here is good as i enquired with some of my friends from south korea contact seung ho seok mobile 97100694 telephone 2207558,1
i was pleasantly surprised to find a korean restaurant in the middle of muscat the ambience and service were average but the restaurant was clean word of warning it is kind of hard to find with all of the adjacent construction we ordered the set menu which included pajeon korean pancakes japchae sweet potato noodles dukbokki rice cakes in a spicy sauce bulgogi korean beef bbq and sides bonchon the food was average for korean food in korea or los angeles but i suspect it is pretty good for muscat and oman the price was reasonable but i am on the search for another korean place in muscat which may offer better quality fare ,1
have visited korea twice visiting relatives and the food here compares with the best i had in seoul too bad there s no license for beer ,1
i am so glad i found it finally after so long of searching for this korean resto it is very authentic and brings you back to seoul for their great dishes it will not be called amazing chicken if you will not be amazed with the taste of their chicken dishes the yang nyeom and gan jang or you can order it together superbly delicious i cannot say more you get to experience it and truly enjoy it they offer you variety of complimentary appetizers and all the authentic korean dishes are there from the favorite japchae noodles to its bulgogi variety of soups such as kimchi denjang and yukgaejang will wake yourself up highly recommended for your dining experience stars,1
this is a smaller restaurant a bit hidden by metal barriers the food and service are great we had korean bbq kimchi stew and ramen all were great and made me feel like i was back in korea ,1
it was my second visit last night and was really impressed with the food taste presentation and service being a native asian i am very picky when it comes to asian food and in this part of the globe it s very difficult to find an authentic asian food taste of korea amazing chicken is one of the few authentic asian cuisine restaurant in muscat food was presented with attention to detail and the taste was really tempting that i over ate again will definitely come back to try other listing service in the menu ,1
we thought we were going to a bbq chicken spot but it is authentic korean food great service nice atmosphere amazing food a feast for the tongue with amazing flavor ,1
and were never disappointed you can never go wrong with the set menu although quite tricky minimum order of 2 and everything to share we are 3 and were just enough for small eaters like us will definitely return ,1
i was craving for korean food and couldn t find it anywhere in muscat then was told by one of asian friend about this place and i cannot get enough of the food over here staff is easy going and very much approachable and the food yummmmm try the kimchi fried rice it s surprisingly tasty ,1
a great place where you ll find really good korean dishes the bbq is brilliant and the noodles as well the restaurant is very nice and feels like you re at a house staff were very friendly ,1
i found this restaurant on tripadvisor as i was looking for a korean restaurant in muscat my friends and i a group of 5 people had dinner here on the 21st of january 2016 it s in an alley across from chocolate room there is a little area to park your car in front of the restaurant it s open 7 days a week it s closed from 3 pm to 4 30pm the prices are reasonable and the food is to die for i had dukbokki kimchi jeon japchae my husband had bulgogi and my friend had bibimbab they were all delicious it is a small restaurant but if you miss korean food in oman you can definitely have it here ,1
i love the new look of amazing chicken resto it gas a modern look and really stylish food review i love the bulgogi beef with veggies its the best ive had so far jap chae a bit oily but great the beef wrap in lettuce was amazing bibimbap uhmm a bit bland but satisfying but again the service was excellent the owner was accomodating and i will be back for more and will do more reviews rating food 7 5 10 service 10 10 price average,1
we re fond of japanese and korean dishes and ever since the first korean restaurant that we discovered near ghala closed we missed eating authentic korean food in muscat that s why when friends told us that there s another korean restaurant in the capital we searched for it and tried their signature dishes we were not disappointed the chicken was fantastic there are 2 variants one glazed with honey barbecue sauce the other just plain fried it is basically similar to the dish from our favorite restaurant when we visited seoul their japchae was also superb and the kimbap as well their bulgogi was not exactly what i expected but it was also generally good they even serve few japanese dishes such as the miso soup which we ordered which i would say was also tasty the only thing i was disappointed a bit was that the side dishes ban chan was fewer compared to the previous korean restaurant that we used to visit this restaurant is a little bit small there are only about 5 tables if i remember correctly there is ample parking space at the side of the building where the restaurant is located in terms of location the restaurant is not hard to find as it is just on the opposite road of chocolate room another popular establishment in ghubra the price is a little bit on the expensive side but that s how it is anyway in majority of restaurants in muscat ,1
food in boulder is usually pretentious and expensive but it s such a relief there are cozy little places like this in town my friends and i go here often and if you have time and are hungry for a good meal it s a great spot the owner is always delightful and kind to us the sake and beer choices are the best and everything i ve ever eaten here is so good i highly recommend ,1
i ve only been there once but the food was amazing 7 of us went we all got different meals and everyone was very happy i got the lunch bento box with bulgogi it was amazing it comes with rice and a little salad ,1
 where if you do not order soup the proper way the owner chases you out that s what this place reminded me of i enjoyed by galbi short ribs although i have had much better my wife enjoyed her dish and when she requested hot sauce the owner server discouraged her from using it we had read other reviews warning us of him so we treaded lightly lol decent korean food but we ve had much better if you visit just nod your head and agree with the owner ,1
this is the best authentic korean food in boulder with a unique and fun atmosphere don t let the strip mall fool you it s super clean delicious food family owned business and you can tell how much pride goes into everything be sure to kimchi pancake app bulgogi and bibmap great for lunch and dinner ,1
we were two couples looking for korean food and this was a recommendation of a friend the bibimbap with korean beef and an egg is delicious and the dumplings are awesome as well the owner himself serves and his wife cooks the owner is extremely nice the place looks very uninteresting from the outside and inside it is a collection of random stuff from all over the world this place is worth a try ,1
i ve been in boulder for 25 years and never tried this place finally went there with my wife and let s just say we were rather disappointed food was average service was less than average and value was dismal ,0
we visit korea house when we want a change from our usual restaurants the food is always good and they do have a limited selection of beer and wine the food is korean with some japanese influences the kimchi was not killer spicy the dumplings were tasty and the bulgogi beef was moist and tender in the past i ve had the very tasty but spicy kimchi soup spicy items are clearly marked on the menu the decor in this small restaurant is the very home like with lots of korean knickknacks on display the service is polite and efficient and the prices are reasonable for boulder ,1
this place is a gem in boulder that few know about this place has amazing food i love their mandoo soup i always get that or their spicy beef soup the kimchi is fantastic and the rice cooked to perfection it is a family owned place one of the few remaining in boulder where the husband serves the food and his wife cooks he is the most pleasant person you will ever meet he pulls out your chair for you when seating and always is attentive and comes quickly if you need something the restaurant is very cute and i admire the way he decorates it is a random assortment of stuff from all over the world the restaurant is always clean as if he just opened the food smells delicious from the back i have become a regular because of his food and the family s kindness i was having a rough day once and he brought a mochi dessert on the house if you are looking for quality korean food at a reasonable price this is the place to come he is always so grateful to all who come to eat at his restaurant this place is by far my favorite place to eat in boulder and i was born and raised here he will go to any length to make sure you enjoy your meal you can also do take out but i highly recommend you stay and enjoy his hospitality he has korean and other asian beers as well as sake of different types this restaurant is sadly tucked away behind a gas station so it is not visible from 28th street but once you know where it is it is very convenient with tons of parking available great place to eat alone with family or friends i always walk out with a smile on my face and a warmth in my belly due to his wife s amazing cooking to the customer who said that he charged them 20 tip without them knowing then he did not read his receipt or the menu so please disregard that review as the owner is the farthest thing from a con man as noted with the dessert he so generously gave to me i have a feeling the customer leaving the one star review had a party of six or more and it is common practice at restaurants to place a 20 gratuity charge on this many at one table so next time you want a really good place to eat with great service stop in here it is well worth it i guarantee you won t be disappointed ,1
excellent service and food owners are very friendly and warm love their galbee beef ribs and japchee sweet potato noodles my 4 year old loves their chicken beef udon i always go there with my family for dinner and coworkers for business lunch very good place for any occasion family business ,1
the food tastes terrible the portion is super tiny and the price is unreasonable more importantly the owner charged us 20 tips without our permission ,0
we visited on a monday evening just to check it out i tried the bulgogi and it was good and tasted just like the bulgogi i get in korea the kimchi was also authentic and they offer kloud beer on tap so i had that the service was excellent provided by a kind and friendly korean fellow prices were very reasonable there is a wide variety a mix of korean japanese and a bit of pan asian on the menu i suppose that boulder is too small to support a korean only menu as for beer not so many americans have heard of kloud hite or cass so no wonder that more familiar brands like asahi and sapporo are also offered there s a pleasant atmosphere with seating for around 30 so it s not very large i would love to see a real down and dirty grill at the table pork or beef korean bbq place in boulder i ll bet it would be a big hit but for the meantime korea house is worth going to and returning to ,1
i lived in seoul for almost a decade and this place s food tastes nothing like real korean food overpriced though i wouldn t eat their food again at any price even free and the recipes have been changed to suit american tastes ha if you are in colorado and want food that is more indicative of the cuisine you can find in korea i recommend daegee either co location or soban in aurora neither is spot on but they are the closest i ve found ,1
contrary to previous reviews the owner server is friendly and efficient he doesn t try to be your best friend but that s not his job he does see to it that your food arrives promptly and that you have everything you need i didn t need to wave him over for anything all was foreseen he checked several times during the meal just in case i had the bento box with beef and dumplings which proved quite tasty it also included a cabbage side and rice unlike some asian restaurants here this one offers brown rice a healthful plus the decor is a combination american country asian kitsch the location is an easily accessible strip mall with ample parking i will definitely return often and i would encourage others to give it a try ,1
we were the only guests for the lunch and ordered two lunch specials and wanted to get kim chi the owner told us that he can not sell us kim chi since we have lunch special does this guy know how to run a business the food was average but we were interrupted several times when he was trying to take our dishes while we were still working on them the only reason to come here is to have a meal in a quiet read deserted environment never more ,1
good food with a menu of both japanese and korean dishes the location is a little bit out of the way but worth the trek for some quality bibimap ,1
for your own sake please do not go anymore or at all i wish there s negative rating here this is place is horrible not kids friendly not customer friendly my husband me and our kids 3 of them came for lunch my kids are not very quite but well behaved but the guy i think he s the owner said i should watch my kids how rude and we wanted to order sushi roll he said he can t make it so we ordered 2 lunch specials and 1 hot soup but he says lunch special is very small then i asked him how small then he started to give us very bad attitude so my husband said let s go to a different place then he said if you come next time i will call the police this place is totally a joke ,0
the owner waiter was not pleasant in taking our order and we felt like he was rushing us when there were only one or two tables being occupied serving size of dishes are small ,0
i had gyoza which was very good my husband wanted korean food so he had a bento box with beef and dumplings his beef was supposed to be thinly sliced beef but it was hamburger without seasonings his dumplings were severely burnt nearly inedible the salad was a bit of iceberg lettuce with no dressing the white rice was harmless when the manager owner asked how our food was we told him he was rude and surly and followed us out the door and stood outside watching us as we drove away i felt sorry for the little waitress but no one should go there ,0
lovely ambiance and good food love the stone pot bibimbap it s tucked away in a small space but well worth seeking out ,1
one day we were the first customers in this restaurant and we found the owner chef meticulously sorting through the bean sprouts to remove any that were not up to her expectations we have been frequenting this restaurant since the early 90 s and these owners have really brought the quality up the seaweed salad is the best i have had anywhere i love the bibim bob and the mandu guk and my husband always orders kimchi chigie even when he thinks he s trying something different the waiter comes and he orders his kimchi chigie one of our favorite restaurants ,1
i was so excited when i walked in this restaurant that i d eaten in before it was like walking into a japanese korean house everyone thinks japanese homes are like zen gardens ha it was very cozy with many things everywhere on the walls on all the surfaces on shelves everywhere so my thought was ah new management new cook alas new does no mean better this restaurant changes hands frequently but seems never to rise above mediocre the owner cook is very pleasant and capable not sure how he d handle a big rush with a complex order but he was fine tonight the food was fine just not really good not special tasting ,1
good food and cute little place the chef owner is a great guy very attentive especially on a slow night the food was hot and tasty enjoyed our meal ,1
first off it seems some of the reviews below are highly inaccurate you should ignore them entirely especially the one calling into question the english skills of the owner with particularly well placed poor grammar this restaurant is the closest thing to being in korea that i have experienced in colorado i lived in suwon south korea for more than a year and this place captures the ambiance exactly it s like eating in a korean living room with fun little decorations everywhere the food is fresh tasty and authentically korean we didn t order sushi but kept to the kimchi jjigae 김치 찌개 and kimchi jeon pancake it was relaxing and we had a great conversation with the owner over our food after he learned that we had lived in korea he gave us a kloud beer on the house very friendly very helpful very tasty if you want korean food in boulder this is the place to go ,1
my wife and i enjoyed a wonderful lunch here we split the kimchi soup and deluxe combination our first taste of korean food and we were delighted with the new spices and tastes to me the food was gourmet high quality lots of care seemed like very authentic food dinnerware decor even music this is a small family run restaurant you feel like a guest in their home everything nice quality and gracious not inexpensive but seemed worth it to us portions seemed just right more would have been too much and we never take home a doggie bag we look forward to eating here again ,1
this place had a very decent meal the staff was really friendly and everything seemed very clean the restaurant provided us with a good amount of side dishes vegetables and the food we re very fresh i ll definitely come back ,1
i have been here four times twice for dine in and twice for carry out i am not a asian food aficionado but the dishes i have had here have been very good even when i wasn t sure what i was ordering i would definitely recommend the kimchee soup it s great ,1
the food was ok not great seems like years ago there was another korean restaurant here that was much better i am not a big fan of a minimum credit card charge especially a 10 minimum so for one at lunchtime you need to spend 10 so the owner can save a few cents it is a shame because this restaurant could be so much better ,0
my husband and i both lived in korea and i have lived in japan and we found this restaurant to be just what we missed we came for a late dinner and had great food and service this small restaurant stocks every kind of korean and japanese beer has numerous appetizers and sides dumplings rice kimchi gyoza many entree options great sets and a full sushi menu the price is right and it s worth checking out ,1
went here on my own when i was in the area for business the décor is a bit eclectic and the restaurant is small because of this the service was prompt my order came and the food was great there was a small problem with my order which the chef and owner i believe was eager to rectify after the fix he also brought me a free cup of miso soup and some amazing honey ginger tea i loved the kimchi and he was so appreciative of me telling him that i felt like someone was cooking from their home kitchen and genuinely cared about my experience and also took pride in their work i ll go back any time i m in the area ,1
my husband went to pick up lunch and had a great experience it was after normal lunch hours so the owner took the time to walk him through the menu options we were new to korean food and gave him a free cup of tea so he could thaw out a bit while the food was prepared he ordered a bulgogi and a beef bibimbap both were delicious and the price was definitely right we ll definitely try out more dishes in the future ,1
these people treat me really well i love the kimchi pancakes i get them mild delicious if you are not accustomed to korean food or do not like a lot of spice just tell them and they will tone it down for you as they do for me i love the barbecue chicken salad do not miss the pearl barley tea it is different but it is great the people here work very hard to satisfy you some of the items on the menu are an adventure for some americans so ask if americans are going to like them if you are looking for adventure the food is very good the soups are particularly good spicy and full of vegetables and sea food you can them to adjust the level of spice if the stock is not pre prepared the korean style sushi is a little different than the japanese but if you like sushi you will like simple honest sushi here ,1
the waiter of this restaurant was extremely arrogant and went totally psycho when two of us asked whether we could sit at a table of 4 when there is only one table taken by two guests in the entire restaurant with about 10 tables total he owner said it was their lunch time and they did not want 2 guests to sit at a table of 4 i asked then why the other two guests were sitting at a table of four he said because they were americans at that moment my friend and i just wanted to get food and leave but his rudeness was not done yet when we ordered and asked about lunch special the owner said no it is not lunch time then i asked when is your lunch time then he got pissed and asked us to leave omg this is horrible i promised we were not being arrogant or anything at the beginning i was thinking his rudeness might be a result of his limited english as an immigration i should have more patience and sympathy but no i was wrong he was rude and the reason he refused us what he served with the two white americans was because we are not white although i did not have the chance to dine here i got a chance to glance at their menu it was pricy compared to many other korean restaurants in this area and they don t have many typical korean dishes on their menu so it might be a good thing we were driven out of this place it was my first time ever to write a review about anything online i just feel there are so many hard working restaurant owners and waiter waitresses to be supported and this kind of people should run out of business if they are not changing their attitude avoid this restaurant ,0
i have never felt such an overwhelming urge to write a negative review for an establishment i walked in after a long day of work looking to order some takeout and enjoy it at home after perusing the menu i decided to order an appetizer vegetable dumplings and a roll of sushi i m a tiny gal 4 11 and 96 lbs so this is more than enough to feed just myself i had however been looking forward to trying the food here and had every intention of coming back and eating in another day when i had more of an appetite and could order a larger meal today i wanted to keep it simple the owner however refused to even serve me unless i ordered an entree which i simply wasn t interested in today not only that but if i asked any questions about the items or dishes not only did i not get much of a response he just seemed irritated and responded in a very condescending manner i left absolutely disgusted with the way i was treated and you can rest assured i will never step foot in this restaurant again i m positive there are plenty of other restaurants in the area that would be happy to have my business and who are actually interested in having returning customers good luck establishing any kind of clientele with this attitude ,0
the food is average and they were extremely rude to my family the restaurant is always half empty at best and they made a point to come tell us my two year old was being too loud she wasn t doing anything other than talking and playing in a normal voice they then proceded to rush us out and tell us we weren t welcome to return i will never set foot in this place again if you go don t bring your kids ,0
i haven t had great korean bbq in boulder or denver in years i had a craving for kal bi and decided recently to give korea house a try based on some other reviews on here not only did i have a great and high quality meal obviously prepared with care for a fair price but i enjoyed the hospitality and friendliness of the staff and the owners when i walk into korea house i feel like i m walking into the warm inviting home of my one of my school friends when i was growing up the food and the experience is prepared with love check it out ,1
my husband and i came here for lunch i had the hot stone bibimbap and he had the spicy pork bulgogi my bibimbap came with soup which wasn t hot i was cold so really would have liked some hot soup and quite bland the bibimbap was adequate it is kind of hard to mess up bibimbap the spicy pork wasn t at all like any bulgogi we have had anywhere the flavor wasn t there and the sauce was pasty tasting the meal came with two small dishes of kimchi and pickle none of the other accompanyments that i normally see i have spent much time in south korea and have visited many korean restaurants and this just wasn t it l always get worried when a menu tries to do too much this place had everything from noodles to sushi ,1
this place is very authentic korean bibim bob is so incredibly good kim chi is tasty honey ginger tea is awesome there is a dish with cellophane noodles veggies and beef that is great this place switched owners not too long ago so some of these bad reviews are from before the new owners took over i highly recommend checking this place out ,1
i have been eating at korea house for years it is small unpretentious and tucked away in a strip mall they have redecorated recently and i find the food is still great i eat the japanese food this is in my opinion the best udon soup in town also great gyoza couldn t tell you about the korean food but don t believe the bad reviews it is a really great little place ,1
my husband and i have eaten at korea house on occassson for several years and always enjoyed it but on our visit today i was greatly disappointed it looked like the decor had changed so perhaps it is under new management but they had better review their changes or i m pretty sure the will go out of business my favorite dish is bulgogi a korean bbq beef this restaurant used to have wonderful slices of this marinated beef the dinner i got today arrived in a bento box which is a novel way to serve asian food however the meat that came in the box was like leftover scraps it was about four tablespoons of beef shreds the biggest was about the size of a dime the was about half a cup of rice a teaspoonful of green vegetable and about a tablespoon of kimchi i had ordered a combo with dumplings gyoza and there were four of those without the unique dipping sauce that usually accompanies it 2 00 worth of food costed 10 50 i left there very diappointed and hungry sad to say i will not be back ,0
i had read preivous reviews which were very negative so i was sckeptical i went for lunch one day and since we enjoyed it we went for dinner to see how they handled each service food was good service was very attentive i travel a lot and always seek out asian restaurants korea house isn t 5 star but it is very good the kimchi is great pickled veggies are good the kalbi my favorite is very good the galbi was disappointing overall i like this testaurant will defintely return ljs,1
we ve had high expectations as we booked the korea royal cuisine online costing us quite something even the package we chosen was the cheapest one the experience was contrary to what we expected first we were not sitted in a palace like dining area in fact it was like a shack with no window to any outside view and only big enough for 4 square tables inside next there s no air circulation comfort in the room and it s next to the kitchen so no ambience no comfort and no view the food spread was good but was averagely prepared there are couple of nice dishes such as the nicely cooked abalone but a lot other were very basics ordinary the cutlery used were also very ordinary making us feel the value for money is not worth it not to mention the beef was so tough that myeongdong street bbq beef is so much better conclusion we feel the charges is simply not worthy the food ambience provided and we suspected this is far from the real royal cuisine skip this ,0
my korean mum has reserved a representation here koreans seem to be very proud of their folklore i found the representation nice but i was not impressed subtitles are in english available you can take pictures with the dancers at the end and there is a very nice shop with high end artcrafts ,0
it was the history of the building and the so called traditional joseon dynasty meal described in the website that make me want to experience eating there the reception where guests were received was bare and i mean really bare there was only a standing podium and a staff to receive the guests and check the name for the reservation we were led to a dining room which looked like a dining hall not a tinge of class or history in there lunch was mediocre we can get better food costing much less in restaurants in town description of the buildings within the compound seemed very interesting in the website but again i was disappointed i mean they were architecturally nice traditional buildings but not as grand as i expected i was disappointed with the meal but may be it was lunch and the set meal that i gave have chosen is a let down i give them the benefit of doubt that the korean banquet and the meal with show may be better the only thing traditional from this experience is that all the lady staff are dressed in their hanbok credit must be given to the staff who responded to online booking and enquiries promptly ,0
authentic place to get good korean food my biggest complaint was the bright lighting it should have been dimmer food was good and service was excellent cool building too ,1
i booked dinner reservation after reading the history of this place expected the dinner to be a true royal cuisine experience disappointed from the seating two types of kimchi was given to each it tasted like cabbage with water is this what the kings ate they sure missed out on something delicious there were a few dishes that were ok but overall they food lacked seasoning and tasted like it was made in a hurry like the sweet and dry bulgogi there were only a few tables dining those of us who were hoping the reviews of poor food would be wrong on the other hand the show was very well done even my niece and nephew enjoyed it and they don t speak korean skip the meal it is overrated and pricey for the quality enjoy the show ,1
first of all the place is nice you can walk around the house for some picture taking of traditional house designs though the area is not that big staffs are accommodating friendly and totally no issues for english communication as i traveled with my pregnant wife i do not have issues on asking them for those prohibited foods for her like raw meat and those with caffeine regarding the food the food is great and a bit different compared to the typical menu on restaurant thus not sure if those are actually traditional what i remember is that the servings are small but it is a lot and they serve it so fast that we haven t finished yet with the first one but they are already serving the 3rd dish but i think they are doing it so you will able to finish your meal before the show starts about the show same with the other reviews recommendable and very traditional i m about to give a perfect rating for this review because of the show but i feel that the price is very expensive that i expect more maybe on the food and no extra charges on the drinks ,0
we had the dinner followed by the show the staff were very nice but the food was not to our taste and pricey and i eat korean food the show on the other hand was entertaining and made the night if my friends go later i tell them to do the show only ,0
i don t really give reviews online but i believe visitors should stay away from this restaurant as my experience was totally disappointing my wife and i went to seoul in october 2015 for our honeymoon although we haven t been to south korea before we do enjoy plenty of authentic korean food in sydney we picked this restaurant as we saw the good reviews on the internet however we were extremely disappointed after having the royal cuisine before visiting the restaurant i made a booking via email and to make sure we could have the royal meal although i ve got a response saying food did not need to be ordered in advance i was told at the restaurant that royal meal need to be ordered in advance i admit that the service was good and good service is common in seoul but the food was extremely bad the meat was rough and the food was cold we were expecting authentic traditional korean food but we ended up having some westernised fusion dishes the meal was a disaster not only because of the low quality of the food but also the environment we were lead into a room where all foreigners dinning together while i saw koreans were allowed to dined in spacious traditional rooms for all the unpleasant hours i spent in this restaurant i was charged 350 aud for a 4 person meal that is very unreasonable for the quality of food provided as a good korean bulgogi bbq dinner for 2 person would cost less than 100 aud in seoul that said seoul is a great modern city and i really enjoyed staying there this was a bad experience but other local restaurants i ve been to were extremely good i believe this place was setup to rip off tourists for visitors who s travelling to south korea and looking for a royal cuisine please look somewhere else and stay away from this restaurant ,0
first i want to warn you that there are two restaurants called korea house in seoul take care which korea house entry on trip advisor you are looking at i am writing about the restaurant with this phone number 82 2 2266 9101 and the web address http www koreahouse or kr eng en_skin index html that other korea house listed within trip advisor has several reviews that i believe are for the restaurant we visited the other korea house specializes in korean beef dishes and the menu looked very interesting but we did not eat there the staff was gracious dealing with our mistake and called us a taxi overall the meal service and environment were wonderful we arrived an hour late and in the dark but were welcomed with smiles from our hostess wearing a traditional korean costume we were lead through a large patio area where dances and other programs are conducted during the day on the far side we ascended a set of rough stone steps and followed a cobble stone path to the building we would dine in it was very impressive and the landscape lighting made it even more so there are several separate buildings and if you sign up for a court cuisine dinner you will be seated in your own dinning room my daughter in law was concerned about my back and knees and asked that we be seated at a table rather than eating laying on the floor when our hostess slid the door back of our dinning room the table was low but the space under the table was hollow allowing us to sit normally on padded seats that had backs very comfortable the dinner is very similar to ordering from a tasting menu at a nice restaurant there are several courses depending on the meal you choose we had the eojin jeongchan dinner it is pricey but you are paying for the experience as well as the gourmet food follow the link i provided above click on english and look at royal cuisine to see the menu all of it was delicious and the experience was fun our waitress dressed in the traditional costume spoke good english and was very helpful attentive and did not seem perturbed in the least we arrived an hour late i don t know when i will have an opportunity to return to seoul but the full experience of this place was worth the stop if you time it better than we did you can also attend a theater production following the meal see the website for details ,1
loved sitting on the floor and experiencing real korean food there was too much food neither my husband nor i could eat everything ,1
we truly enjoyed the meal service and show it was one of my favorite experiences in our 17 night trip to korea my wife is korean and researched the menus and shows on the korean website since i am a picky eater we chose the haerin jeongsik menu a little more expensive but very good we accompanied the meal with a couple bottles of bek se ju which became my go to drink for the rest of the trip a quote from their website the traditional court cuisine of korea house is cooked on the basis of the records contained in ancient literature the foods are cooked by superior chefs at korea house under the supervision of han bok ryeo who has been designated as important intangible cultural property no 38 for his expert knowledge about the court cuisine of the joseon dynasty service freindly and outstanding maybe due to the constant delivery of new dishes throughout the meal and my wife s ability to communicate in korean if they didn t understand my texan all the staff were dressed in traditional hanboks we enjoyed the show and would see it again given the opportunity i particularly like the instruments and sounds they made one selection was 4 drummers on stage playing together and putting on quite a show i also like the dancers and the way their dresses shape while spinning around all seemed very graceful in their movement after the show the performers were in the lobby for people to take photos with them we took tons of photos but unfortunately they are still on the phones go to http www koreahouse or kr eng en_skin index html for more info on food and show ,1
hi all i would recommend this place very highly if your a foodie and want to explore authentic korean cuisine the standard menu chronologically designed to give you variety of food to your taste buds and the place is more than 60 year old and korea house has a legacy of being dining place for korean dynasty if you are in seoul south korea this is must visit place regards nt,1
the ambience of the place is fairly traditional and be prepared to sit on thin cushions with your legs crossed and tugged under low tables the food served are in small portions and you can expect up to 10 varieties of traditional food served one after another by girls clad in hangboks you may not know what you have been served and the best thing to do is to ask the waitresses on what and how best to eat it as expected the meals can be very pricey i personally do not fancy such traditional food served in this manner ,0
taken as a guest by korean hosts and what an experience a multiplicity of flavours beautifully presented and served go if you get the chance but i didn t see the bill ,0
korea house is known for it s great service and quiet settings you pay a premium for the location and the restaurant is only made up of private rooms so i recommend reservations but usually they can squeeze a party of four the side dishes are usually exquisite here the beef is of the best quality though for basically the same quality you can literally walk about 100 meters to saebyuk jib and eat good meat but you are paying a premium here for the privacy and small touches for example the charcoal that they use is not preheated and they light in front of you since they are using a very good quality of charcoal ask the waitress for the best cuts of meat that are available at the moment and they will recommend for you as each day quality can vary they also have a dried fish bori geul bi with a green tea soup with rice to finish the meal you take your hot rice and drop it in your cold green tea bowl take a piece of the dried fish that is broken up for you and dip it in the sauce they give and immediately eat the rice that was mixed with the green tea soup it is fabulous i enjoy the dish so much that i visit the restaurant for the dried fish during lunch time and skip the bbq ,1
the beef bulgogi is excellently prepared and delicious i had it with white rice and korean kimchi strongly recommend,1
i highly recommend this restaurant the food was amazing and service was very good we ordered galbi tang and kimchi ommelletes which were amazing ,1
the food was floating in oil we thought the noodles with vegetables and beef were over cooked and also in too much oil ,0
my coworkers and i order at this restaurant on a pretty regular basis the past 3 years we noticed that the service was getting worse as time goes by my coworker called for a pick up order and was told that they just opened and to call back 30 minutes later we have people who did not like kimchi so we asked not to put it in their lunch which before was not a problem but now we were told to just take it out ourselves was very surprised how this place seems to have no idea about providing good customer service very disappointed as they do have good food ,0
had the brisket bulgogi and pork belly our favorite was the bulgogi and brisket make sure if you want the all you can eat you order off of that menu vs the standard menu tables are tight with all of the sides but definitely yummy ,1
what a great experience we love going to nyc to get authentic korean food cooked tabletop but now we can have it close to home too the meat was very fresh and flavorful the sides were great and the kimchi pancake was everything i hoped it would be ,1
what is going on with korea house longwood we ve been coming here for over 5 years and used to love the place the last 2 visits the service has been terrible he lady almost threw the plates and side dishes on the table no courtesy not smile what so ever we smiled and tried to better the situation and it did nothing it s sad good food and terrible service we re going to have to start going to another korean restaurant ,0
service is impeccable the galbi is just superb and the portion is excellent the meat succulent the taste is perfect the kimchi is wonderful if you love korean food there is only one place to go in the entire tri county area this is it ,1
once a month our social group tries a new ethnic cuisine the korea house is a good place to get your feet wet very good service and everything we tried was good the only thing i wished that the spicy dishes were a bit more hot i probably should have took the initiative to ask i give korea house a great recommendation ,1
my wife and i shared the ribs which were well seasoned and accompanied by 6 smaller side dishes it was plenty to share next time i will try the grill and cook on our own ,1
been here for lunch and dinner and i enjoy dinner better because i love cooking on the grill love the short ribs and beef love the assorted dishes especially the eggplant cooking on the grill is super fun which it was in a better location ,1
not sure if this is a chain similar to the one on colonial but the decor and menu items were similar except this restaurant is bigger with a higher ceiling their sides were just as flavorful was not overwhelmingly spicy still a fan of their hot stone bibimbap the waitress recommended the sundubu tzigae tofu and seafood soup count me in as a new fan of this soup the black goat soup is no longer in season aside from soy sauce they have a red sauce available which compliments any hot dish the staff was very friendly and the restaurant itself is clean they do have table top hibachi available if you want to cook the bbq meat yourself i wish it was in a more flattering location i think it borderlines a hole in wall concept but do not judge the interior based on the outside my mother was a little turned off but i insisted we both left happy with our food choices ,1
this korean restaurant is so good the service is fast and friendly the food is amazing it s never too crowded either if you love korean food you need to come check this place out yum ,1
only problem here is that i overeat but my son was visiting and he insisted it s his favorite great for him carnivore me pescatarian and my vegetarian hubby we shared the steamed tofu appetizer very generous serving and the sauce is just fantastic we always ask for extra for the rest of the meal my husband had the tofu bibimbap i had sauteed octopus and veggies nicely spiced and our son loves the beef galbi the side dishes are really good i keep meaning to ask if i can get the green vegetable plus spicy radish as a main the hot tea is very nice they don t excel at dessert but who has room ,1
i ve been divorced for 10 years now from my korean husband and have missed the food until now i finally found an authentic korean restaurant the kimchee is just how i like it and the mondu is amazing flavors are great staff is friendly and i love feeling like i m back at my ex mother in laws eating they offer non spicy meals too if that is not your thing they have the best of all the korean dishes including the soups and the korean bbq whatever you re in the mood for they got it when it comes to korean cuisine ,1
this place serves the authentic korean food at reasonable price ingredients are fresh and services are attentive the restaurant inside is a little dark but relaxing ,1
this was my first time having korean food i was pleasantly surprised the restaurant is very clean and the service is excellent we began with a vegetable pancake that was very good especially with the hot sauce that came with it my chicken was spicy and perfectly cooked there were small dishes of korean vegetables that were all new to me some i liked while others were too new for me to really evaluate i am very pleased i went and will go back the next time i am in sanford the experience is well worth it ,1
i have been going for years and have had every item on the menu the food is extremely fresh and the servers are very polite and friendly this is very authentic food i highly recommend their raw beef and egg yolk dish yukhoe as well as their dumplings gun mandu and bibimbap one of my favorite parts of my dining experience is the little delicious side dishes that come along with the entrees i highly recommend this lovely restaurant ,1
order included bulgogi dol sot bibimbap gyoza hite brews kimchi was some of the best we ve ever had fairly priced good atmosphere ,1
we greatly enjoyed the food at korea house restaurant we each ordered different meats and then shared them the beef bulgogi was by far our favorite we will go again when we are in florida ,1
i took my wife out for dinner at the korea house restaurant service was very good and the food tasted very good it s on the expensive side you ll spend 17 25 per entree and we were a tad disappointed with the fried dumplings overall it was a very good experience and we d return ,1
having lived in korea three years and being married to a korean i think i know good korean cuisine and korea house gets my vote for the best in central florida ,1
korean bbq is one of my favorite foods and while i don t live near korea house this is where i go when i m craving it the wait staff is excellent and if you run out of sides they re more than happy to bring you more ,1
i have been going to this restaurant for lunch takeout on and off the past few months i usually get the beef bulgogi or the beef galbi bento box and they are consistently good it is very filling and comes with rice kimchi vegetables and a fried dumpling ,1
i ve been here twice for lunch and ordered the bibimap both times which is a dish of rice egg and vegetables and i believe meat if i m not mistaken it comes out sizzling sort of like fajitas and continues to cook in the clay pot which is a neat experience it s also served with six different kinds of kimchi which if you re not familiar with is a wonderful probiotic gut health promoting food and they were all fantastic if you re familiar with latin food you know that people get to fighting for the crispy rice in the bottom of the pot which is another highlight for me about the bibimap in the clay pot my husband ordered the korean barbecue lunch and he really enjoyed it the menu is full of dishes that seem similar to chinese and japanese stir fries as well as other seemingly uniquely korean dishes they also have tables where you can cook yourself in the center of the table ,1
i had spicy chicken and my friend had soup that had shrimp tofu and fish with the bone in the soup was bland but the chicken was really good the 6 sides were interesting none of them made be say oh wow though the service was great and the atmosphere is typical of an asian restaurant not sure i will visit again but it was a nice experience ,1
we have now been to this establishment four times the first was an accident as we were hungry and noticed the sign now it is our go to restaurant the food is very good but the distinguishing aspect is the service it is fast and accurate though is is often busy the servers are attentive and remember to do what was asked there is almost no waiting for to get the drink order going and food arrives very quickly we recommend korea house highly,1
it may not dazzling decor but the food is delicious and generous for the price every time my family visits three we make sure we have the chicken and beef bulgogi they give several toppings go with it and you cook it at your table will come here every time we visit orlando ,1
i started coming to korea here 4 years ago to get aquainted with korean cuisine and practice my very basic language skills before going overseas to visit my sister in itaewon the young man who took care of us was wonderful and since they weren t busy during that visit he took a few moments to answer some questions and correct my pronunciation i had watched videos and read up on the variety of cultural dishes the meal we were presented with was beyond what i could have hoped for everything tasted so damn good when i was visiting south korea and ordered the same things i wasn t surprised that the quality execution of the meals i received here were the same as in seoul etc since my trip my husband and i go out to korea house at least once every 6 months every visit is just as good as the last and the staff are always so polite sometimes they ll even make special training chopsticks for my boys ,1
pricey but good korean food everytime we are around longwood area we crave for the food here bulgogi gimbab and so on ,1
three adults introduced two kids all of us non korean to this cuisine and it was a great experience the service was superb explaining any dish we weren t familiar with and preparing the meat for us at the grill built into our table which the kids loved apart from one appetizer that wasn t a big hit all of the grilled meats and side dishes were excellent especially the pork bulgoi which was labeled as spicy but was more of a pleasant tingle than really hot try this place if you like a kobe type japanese restaurant much more flavorful cuisine here and lower prices ,1
when you visit either get one of the bowls or go all out and do it right by sitting at the bbq table and cook your korean bbq yourself what a fun place if you go for bbq be ready for the copious sides they bring out in little dishes they provide refills on the little sides if you ask don t worry it s plenty of food the kimchi here be ready because this place is the real deal mmmmm there is an attached karaoke bar you rent a room and you get food and alcohol delivered to your private room great party place this is a real experience most authentic in orlando area ,1
over the years their menu has changed and as well as the décor their menu appeared to have more selection the staff was pleasant and welcoming they will ask you if you want a table with the stove grill or a standard table we got the standard i ordered a gimbap for an appetizer it is their take on a sushi roll it was quite good my wife had the dolsot bibimbap which is a veggie mix with kimchi in a hot bowl it also had an egg in it i had the sundubu tziigae that is a hot pot with seafood and tofu the taste was great but only 1 shrimp 1 piece of squid and a tiny piece of probably octopus they did refill the little dishes of kimchi items service was very good overall i felt the quality and portions dropped korean dishes have been a favorite of ours for some time ,0
if you like galbi or pork bulgogi this is the place great kimchi service was excellent tonight food came out hot everything was superb you know it s good when it s packed with koreans i ve been going here for 20 years my favorite restaurant glad it s close by if you like korean food this is the only place to go ,1
went for dinner this was our go to korean restaurant we sat down and immediately noticed very loud rap music coming through the restaurant speakers young servers and several young people standing around kitchen doors we asked if they would turn off the music and they asked if we wanted to move to another table so we moved to a table at another korean restaurant the owners shouldn t let the children run the restaurant ,0
i was beyond surprised and relieved to find good korean food in this state i m from nyc so my standards for asian cuisine in general are obnoxious we had galbi well seasoned delicious ddukbokki super spicy wonderful average chicken fried rice and some average pork belly everything was fresh authentic inexpensive i would come back here if i ever find myself in longwood again the staff here is also quite nice ,1
besides all the great awards this place has a special award in our hearts the food cannot taste authentic enough until it is served with the proper ambiance you ll be delighted by the grills built in the table sections for family style or large party for a smaller party without grills it also has quaint private tables the wait staff are always very cheerful and will explain in broken english what you want to order lovely people will serve the side dishes that are always fresh and always an incredible variety a variety of korean wines are offered that are served in a special sake cup reasonable prices and a great menu await you i encourage you to take the right person with you who will appreciate this culture and not spoil your time with limits ,1
good service quality food i ve eaten korean food all over the world including korea and this place is really good the chega is great and all the kimchi great with service to match ,1
amazing korean food i am addicted to the pork bulgogi but all the food is very fresh and very authentic ,1
my husband and i lived in korea for 3 years and crave good korean food often korea house restaurant did not disappoint it was very authentic we will go back as often as we can ,1
our friends who lived in korea turned us on to the cuisine since their favorite resturant closed i have never had any better or even any as good today at korea house i finally had food as good we had bulgogi and bibimbop all delicious as was their accompanying ban chan or small side dishes the staff was helpful friendly and pleasant i highly recommend this restaurant it is worth the drive from orlando ,1
this is our favorite korean restaurant in orlando we probably go here at least once a month the bulgogi seafood pancake japchae and galbi are 4 favorites the food is consistently good ,1
my wife is korean and i lived in korea for three years we ve eaten in all the korean restaurants in the orlando area and korea house is the very best in fact none even come close ,1
authentic korean barbecue is very good good variety and quality of foods the restaurant is spacious but not too elegant ,1
i asked one of my students who was korean where i should try korean out he replied korea house in longwood i was so happy since it is near my house i have been several times now and i am extremely happy the staff is friendly the food is good and the addition of a karaoke club is even better i have not had a bad meal here the price is a bit steep but i m sure you can do better on price if you don t want to try everything like i do ,1
i ve eaten here for 15 years today it was as good as ever the galbee and kimchi are excellent i ve never been disappointed if you like or want to try korean food this is the best place in the orlando area the staff are wonderful ,1
great service amazing food no wait on a friday at 7 night food came quickly not greasy and veggies were fresh not canned or wilted we got the gun mandu gimbap ojinguh bokkeum chungpa sogogi great place for families with kids toddlers and babies staff was excellent and very accommodating we ll definitely be back ,1
my wife would like to try some korean food and we found this one near us we ordered the seafood hotpot recommended by someone else and we actually felt a little bit disappointment the quantity was enough for two persons but most of them are vegetables and tofu a few seafood inside such as shrimp we still believe it is the best korean cuisine in orlando area maybe we have not tried its best korean food yet and we would like to take another chance later on ,1
my wife and i really enjoyed our dinner here they also have hibachi style table side cooking but we ate at a table the ribs were so good but i got full very quickly from a big lunch earlier they made my hotel room smell so delightful every time the fridge door opened and i almost cried when i left the leftovers in the fridge due to a long day ahead on the road for someone who enjoys korean bbq short ribs and live travel to orlando or central florida this is the place to go the beef bulgogi was amazing too portions were large and the appetizer of dumplings was very tasty too we love korean food though we admit we typically do not eat everything this place is the place for someone who wants to try korean or eats it often in my opinion we will be back i will also bring a cooler and get an extra order of short ribs ,1
this was the best korean restaurant i have been to and i highly recommend it to anyone that appreciates authentic korean food the service was fantastic and everyone there was friendly and welcoming i ll return there every time i am in the orlando area thank you for a wonderful dining experience ,1
stopped in for their lunch special the bulgogi box was very tasty full of flavor and good value the portion size was generous and included salad dumpling and veggies the restaurant is simple but clean will try dinner next time i am in the area ,1
i d been to korea house a number of times in the 11 years i lived in the orlando area as with any korean restaurant they stick to real korean food there is no americanization for any reason if you don t like spicy food and i don t mean spicy like mexican food that s mild actually you re probably better to go somewhere else but there are a couple of options safe for non koreans i travelled to the orlando area a few days ago for the first time in four years i got together with 3 friends and we visited korea house they ve resolved a lot of situations since moving to the newer location north of rangeline road the service was quite good they ve installed vents over a few tables to allow for korean bbq korean bbq is where you choose ingredients and cook it at your own table the friends chose gal bi bul gogi and pork bul gogi i chose dae gu jji gae they really really liked the food and being caucasians they don t have much experience with real asian food that s not a criticism it s a fact when places like p f chang s represents itself as real chinese food what can you think i was thrilled with my dae gu jji gae but i really dislike the fish bones i know what s going to happen they don t remove the meat of the fish and put it in the pot to cook they put the fish in the pot in pieces including the bones cod is typically bony anyway so it was a good bad choice i scooped a bit of the broth into another bowl and let the three of them try it they were especially surprised when i told them that it was medium spicy for real asian food we had a good visit and a good meal korea house s owners a family of four care a lot about food and people they really want you to have food you ll always love it shows ,1
the food here was really delicious i came with a friend who was vegan and there were a couple of options on the menu for him but most were meat not holding that against the restaurant though the food was all excellent have actually been turned away a couple of times because they were too busy always a good sign ,1
the place is very warm and welcoming and also the staff tried their best to make us feel at home they answered our questions regarding the food perfectly to help us decide and the food ended up being quite affordable and very tasty we had some feuerfleisch which apparently it s the national dish in south korea and some pork and squid all of them incredible pro tip don t miss out on the sake it was cheap and exceptional ,1
a small restaurant with nice tastes of corea try the traditional barbecue without hesitating i would recommend it ,1
the place is so small and they only accepted people with reservation in advance for dinner this is our second time in this restaurant and we have noticed they getting busy or more hectic many people come and refused as they not making reservation even only 1 2 person the food was the same the fish soup with red chili broth was great and tasty the kimchi soup with tuna also very delicious but the bibimbap a little bit boring too dry and no have a good taste of sesame paste as in seoul or any city in korea the free appetizers is always generous portions like in many korean style restaurant the high light was the cinnamon drink a little bit too sweet for western tongue but compliment the spiciness of korean chili paste on the dish the staff is friendly and seem so busy as she is alone serving so many guests ,0
this is a very small local restaurant situated in wedding berlin interior is very relaxed and brings auticity to the restaurant the food is really great kindda home cooking style and isn t that just preferable frankly very tasteful and good nice and friendly staff on top of that prizes are low in the back you can sit in korea style low tables superb be sure to book a table beforehand as the place is always packed very recommendable ,1
went here and place was empty and group of 8 a little apprehensive order spirits beer bulgogi and everyone was so please we gave u tv a go really good food and we ll looked after if your passing give it a go ,1
love korean food and thus place is great small but good service sometimes changes and varies in quality but the food has always been good to great green tea ice cream a must ,1
this little restaurant is run by a family that lives in the same building as the restaurant it is worth ordering one of the meals that is cooked at the table and shared among all we went with 6 people and got a meal that was grilled at our table for us and served with numerous side dishes we definitely did not go away hungry the waitress explained every step she was doing telling us how long it would be until she was back to stir etc so we knew it was not time to start eating the dish yet when it was ready she demonstrated how to wrap it in lettuce for eating and handed her demo to me the oldest woman in the group ,1
the worst experience i have ever had in a korean restaurant i am an asian myself and have been in south korea i can say that i have had amazing korean food everywhere in the world but for sure not in this korea haus i went there with my friends and wanted to try out this korea haus since our favorite korean restaurant just moved to charlottenburg the food was disappointing and the price was way too high according to the size and the taste of the food the four of us ordered four dishes including two portions of bulgogi one fish soup and one noodle dish the bulgogi cost 15 per person and the two portions we had were not even enough for one person to get full there was barely anything in the fish soup maybe four tiny pieces of fish the noodles were kinda ok but did not have much flavor two small side dishes came with the food since the four of us shared the side dish we asked for another portion of kimchi the waiter was nice enough to tell us that we have to pay for extra kimchi we were surprised to hear that because all the normal korean restaurants offer side dishes for free as a custom the waiter went to ask the owner if we could get one for free the owner came out from the back with such an arrogant attitude and told us we cannot get one for free he said if we want to have free side dishes we should go to another place we were totally shocked and could not believe it the owner obviously only wants money and does not care if any customers come back again or not furthermore i for the first time had diarrhea after having korean food as a foodie i will never go back to this place again and would also advise all korean food lovers to avoid this place you deserve better food and treatment for your money ,0
i would have never thought that this place could reserve such a surprise we had the buffet 6 we didn t eat meat but the rest was more than enough there is a selection of korean pickles kimchi cucumber pickles carrots beets delicious stuffed peppers and others you can tell that they are homemade kimtchi was not particulary strong flavoured as i like it but my companion preferred it like this the lady prepared for us freshly deep fried vegetables puffs banana and fish fillets i was really surprised the fish was actually really tasty and fresh perfectly well cooked juicy and delicious even the rest rest was not greasy at all there were a few other dishes that i haven t tried from what i could see it was noodles in different sauces with veggies and meat there was a hot and sour meat soup as well and rice of course i was so happy of changing my mind about this little family run restaurant the owners really care about what they are doing and even though they don t have many clients whenever someone arrives they treat him like a real host at their place the furnishings is really heavy and peculiar but in its own way it gives a feeling of authenticity though not korean elvis was printed all over on the seats the owners seem to be there out of any pretention if not to do the best they can to prepare good food i left this little place with a smile and bitterness too for having prejudged koreas haus as just another fake orientalish imbiss for so long before trying it well at least it has been a good lesson for me and maybe for you as well ,1

on my first visit to south korea i stumble into this bar where i was greeted as if i was coming there for year leo was amazingly hospitable nice friendly very engaging and i feel as if i have known him all my life i definitely made a lifelong friend and leo makhil the cook was also very nice and food was great definitely a must stop when visiting south korea in each one in particular i hear great things about the og cinder bar which on my next visit i will be attending ask for leo he is the best ,1
i had one of the most stressful airport experiences i ve ever dealt with left the airport to find some drinks food and stumbled across the cinder bar the owner and his amazing bartender from vietnam completely turned around my entire day 5 minutes in i had a huge smile in my face from the friendliness of the staff i had some drinks which were all great prices and a burger which was delicious perfect for if you have a layover that s long enough to leave the airport but not long enough to go too far incredible place ,1
this bar is newly opened and is an offshoot of another bar of the same name in incheon city very much nicer than all of the sterile airport hotel bars around this area a lively welcome from warren kidd the owner who asks your name and introduces you to everyone in the bar makes for easy conversation and a friendly atmosphere the bar staff keep the party and conversation going by joining in with a focus on encouraging the buying of rounds of drinks ring the bell and buy everyone in the bar a drink great for the profits but also great for the atmosphere created genuinely enjoyable and a fun atmosphere i didn t have any of the food but it looked like decent bar food burgers etc a highly entertaining evening marred slightly by the feeling that everyone was being pushed into drinking more one of the best bars that i have visited ,1
very good expat pub with a very friendly staff they will get to know you and if you come back after being gone for months you will be greater by name typical pub food that is pretty good ,1
we were offered to taste samples of great collection of beer hence we could try and select the best best quality beer and food though very limited on the menu he ensures the best nice ambience and warren kidd is explosion of energy he also offered to pick and drop at our hotel he knows what he does and how to do it the team is also as good as the owner great fun ,1
nice drafts beer selection very expensive bar in the day of ours visit about of the half of the food manue was not available,0

the cinder bar is a great place to go of you re new to songdo and want to meet up with other foreigners the staff is super friendly and great to talk to and their burgers are great the cocktails are also delicious highly recommend checking out this place ,1
in a land of cookie cutter bars and franchises this quaint bar stands out and demonstrates how to do it right take all of the items from a normal bar add a superior sampling of alcohol choices and a friendly staff who bring customer service to the next level mix these things together and you get a bar that performs where the seats are always warm because nobody wants to leave awesome place i m glad it is in songdo because if it were anywhere else this place would have a line spilling out into the street and you d never get a seat the music is top notch as well ,1
nice and cozy bar the owner warren and his staff daniel mikey and chris to name a few know how to take care of their guests you will be surprised how they will remember your name and drink even with a packed bar excellent drinks but do recommend fish and chips the flying chef burger worth the time money and experience,1
if you are staying in songdo this place should be on your to do list the owner warren is a really nice person that will be glad to welcome you drinks and food are really good enjoying a chat with international people around a beer is always a pleasure ,1
great bar if you are looking for very friendly english speaking staff who go the extra mile music is great and the clientele are fun too if you are lucky enough someone might ring the bell and that is an experience in itself warren the owner is a real character ,1

bar most exclusively targeting foreigners just started some lunch items but it s a place to go at night very friendly owner manager and has a great variety of liquor it s probably the preferred hangout place for the expats in town ,1
seriously the bartender waiter host is the owner his life is this bar he has picked us up and dropped us off at our hotels after dinner and drinks this place is awesome 2 levels of drinking eating and privacy off the beaten path can t hear traffic or noise from outside great beer selection fish and chip is actually great can t believe i m saying that but it s the best in incheon you feel like your at cheers when you are there sam malone would love it ,1

before leaving nz to live in songdo south korea i checked out the important things to me squash golf and a good bar squash is virtually non existent golf is too expensive but the cinder bar oh the cinder bar from the first moment i entered the doors of this small bar i realised it had a huge heart the guy who runs it tirelessly is warren a guy who remembers everyone s names the beer selection is amazing 12 on tap and at least 12 different bottled ales the food is simple but wholesome and tasty do not visit songdo without checking the cinder bar out ,1
went on a saturday night with some friends comfortable interior owner was very friendly and chatted with us how he came to make his beer selections he has a very nice selection of beers the best i have seen in korea up to this point the food we had was very good i will return ,1
cinder is an excellent meeting point for international travellers and residents alike the beers are carefully selected the food is excellent and the owner is attentive and engages his customers in conversations well worth a visit or two ,1

i had a great experience at the cinder bar the drinks were great and the service was even better i highly recommend visiting if you are in the area ,1
since moving to korea in january 2017 this is by far the best spot in the area there is a great mix of local expats and travelers passing through incheon songdo leading to a never know who you might run into evening the location is a bit hidden for a first timer but that adds to the mystique once there the interior is intimate and welcoming there s also additional seating upstairs and a recently added dart machine for a fun competitive game with friends and for spring and fall there is outdoor seating as well you will appreciate the air conditioning indoors during the korean summer months don t miss out on the monthly trivia night as well for a good time with co workers or friends the food with the recently expanded menu is always great remember the cinder bar is a bar so the menu is very appropriate but don t let that fool you in terms of quality and taste my personal favorites are the colonel chicken sandwich and wings which remind of wings from back in the us the burger fish sandwich fish chips and fries are also favorites and give a variety of choices cost is very reasonable and appropriate on to the beer the cinder bar offers a dozen or so beers on tap and countless bottled beers the tap selection is vast from asia pac to europe to us to local craft and includes many types pilsner stout ipa porter wheat etc the whiskey selection is also extensive with many of my favorite single malt scotches and lastly the services is always phenomenal which is the main reason i return warren the owner and his staff are always welcoming to both regulars and first time visitors he goes out of his way to introduce himself and get to know his patrons so if you ve relocated to songdo or happen to be passing through i recommend an evening at the cinder bar ,1
cinder bar is the best place in songdo to chill out meet new people and enjoy some quality international beers oh wait did i mention they also make the best burger in town cinder is run by absolute legend warren along with his mate sam these guys are hard working honest kiwi blokes who always put their customers first warren even arranged free tickets to the baseball for me i ve spent the past 6 months living in songdo and visiting this bar on a semi frequent basis when i moved here i didn t know anybody now i m leaving korea and most of the people i know have all been cinder bar contacts through warren they show the baseball rugby and many other sports not to mention live bands and quiz nights this place has all the hallmarks of a western style bar but with a genuine korean welcome highly recommend you pay a visit any day of the week oh and say hi to warren and sam for me keep up the good work lads ,1
i have travelled all over the world been to countless bars pubs and restaurants the best way to describe the cinder bar is it s all of the above wrapped into a perfect little package of great times exceptional drinks and tasty food all in a warm extremely welcoming atmosphere warren and the entire staff at the cinder are excellent people and extremely personable they will go above and beyond to ensure that if you arrive a stranger you ll certainly leave as a friend this is clearly evident by patrons who return time after time again these people this place is clearly special and truly one in a million hope to see you at the cinder bar soon cheers ,1
i had a little trouble finding the place but once i did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet amazing the beer was ice cold and served in good portions beer price was a little steep for me but i hit happy hour just right so i got a bit of a break totally satisfied pro tip if you are trying to find it if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it s on the left side of the street before the bridge it s in a bit of an alcove in a housing development set back off the road a tad there s a sign the points left and i made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it s the first set of building after the bridge on the right the staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice the fish and chips are phenomenal did i mention the fish and chips are great you should definitely try the fish and chips ,1
if you re in the area be sure to visit warren is awesome always feels good to support a business where the owner sure cares about his work and the people who visit it and their friends thank you warren ,1
great bar friendly owner and staff make you feel welcome and will remember your name on your next visit cheers ,1
i was on business in korea and my work colleagues took me out for a beer after work arrived at the cinder bar which was my friend s regular primarily because it is one of the few true expat pubs in all of incheon the kiwi warren runs the pub and he was most hospitable we settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely even had time for some fish and chips the fish was covered in golden batter and the chips were delicious the bar looks a little broken down as was the area it was located in but that added to the charm if it was a rugby night you could watch the tv but it would ve been a bit of a squeeze there was also an upstairs loft style area overall a pleasant evening after work ,1
cozy bar with a very good selection of craft beers both on tap and in the bottle the owner warren is very friendly and makes you feel welcome the moment you step in the door it is easy to find and is popular with the locals and the expat crowd opens late and stays open late ,1
great expat bar the owner warren is a friendly kiwi who will remember your name from the first time you visit good beer selection great cocktails and the kitchen is getting better every month a very international crowd here i love stopping by every time i m in town ,1
i stopped in at the suggestion of coworkers i wasn t disappointed warren the owner gave me a warm greeting and took very good care of me the bar was a mix of local and expat patrons great selection of beer and although i didn t eat here from what i saw the food looked very good western style and people seemed to enjoy it i ll definitely go back the next time i m in incheon ,1
good option of bar for everyone in this city not just foreigners but also koreans i am a korean this bar has all the kinds of drinks you can imagine the drink prices are very good and the food prices are great too warren the owner speaks english and korean so he talks to everybody he is so popular that he could be the future mayor of incheon the music here is always good and the service is always excellent you have to come here ,1
good option of bar for the expat crowd nothing special pleasing mostly foreigners all kinds of drinks expensive and very small place but apparently the only option in town if you don t speak korean ,1
i have been to this bar twice and every time there were plenty of people especially foreigners the service is good and the quality of the products also ,1
perfect atmosphere food and exceptional customer service terrific bar menu beer selection cocktails etc great place ,1
if you aren t from korea this place will make you feel at home even mix of westerners and locals great place to grab a beer with existing friends and a great place to make new friends hats off to warren love your pub ,1
what a find the cinder bar is amid the high rise buildings stuffed with expensive restaurants massage places doctor s offices and just about everything else in this city there is a much better option the cinder bar is located on the ground level at the last building on the left side of the road just before the bridge as you leave incheon for the airport warren and his new partner sam have crafted this cozy establishment into a welcoming warm and friendly place to have a nice meal and a brew or two if you are in the mood they also have a superior selection of single malt whiskeys the prices are the best you will find in incheon and the atmosphere is unmatched the food is excellent as well this is a family affair and warren s wife is the establishment s cook of particular note is the new hamburger offered which is a new collaboration between warren and the flying chef it s easily the best burger in town should you decide to give the cinder bar a try i can guarantee you will have a new favorite hangout on your list ,1
it was full with clients that s why we got in we asked about lots of optional drinks and snacks trying not to eat anything unusual ,1
excellent place for g ts which feels a bit like a bubble somewhere outside south korea this is probably why so many expats hang around here the owner is a very friendly guy and admittedly one of the best gin and tonic gurus east of london ,1
i was at a conference in korea earlier this month and i was invited to this bar because one of the guys playing in the band was also at our conference with other people from the conference we went there and i had a great time the music was great the drinks were great and the vibe there was very chill and positive warren who i think is the owner was talking to us and making conversations with us and made us feel like we had been there before if i ever go back to korea i d definitely go there again ,1
cinder bar is a great bar to visit when in songdo it can be found near the center of the city by the bridge there is a good selection of beers and other drinks and warren is always thinking about bringing in new ones the owner warren is very friendly and open there are often quiz nights music and other events going on a great place to meet people as well it s worth a visit ,1
friendly staff good beer wine and cocktail menu sport shown on the big telly owned by a kiwi so good for rugby didn t eat so not sure about food ,1
i have been coming to this bar since late 2015 and i must say that i am continually impressed by the motivation and innovation of the staff here from a continually expanding drink menu which will have you staring at the pages for hours to the jazz nights and their trivia night cinder bar and its crew make every visit unique as a long time customer it is hard to be unbiased but the only advice i can offer is that whether you want to just go out and meet some new people prop up on a bar stool and down beers or sit at table and have some cocktails cinder is the only way to go ,1
the night i chose to check out this place happened to be warren s the owner s birthday the entire bar was more than happy to help him celebrate the people are extremely friendly when i first arrived i assumed that everyone in the bar were old friends i was traveling alone and it didn t take very long before a group invited me to hang out with them at their table turns out most people had just met that night everyone was just mingling i definitely recommend stopping in at cinder bar ,1
the cinder bar is a fantastic place to stop and make some new friends warren is the owner chances are he will personally greet you and make you feel like a long lost friend the patrons are a great mix of local and westerners very friendly he has all the liquid refreshments you could hope for and a satisfying menu i had a shrimp platter that was delicious aircrew are always welcome give it a try ,1
this bar came highly recommended from a workmate of mine so all my workmates were keen to see if it lived up to it s expectations i can say without a shadow of a doubt it is a fantastic little place the owner warren is the consummate host he delights in serving some fine local and imported craft beers and makes wicked cocktails thanks for the hangover looking forward to popping back to cinders in songdo to catch up with warren not looking forward to the hangover 5 stars ,1
warren runs a great place drinks food music all done with a passion he makes introductions i ended up talking to ups pilots all night about their cargo looking for investment ideas ,1
my year living in songdo would have been very different without cinder bar warren makes great drinks and the atmosphere is very relaxed with lots of friendly people if you re in incheon looking for a relaxed bar with great drinks great people and great food cinder is the place to go ,1

i had a great experience at the cinder bar the drinks were great and the service was even better i highly recommend visiting if you are in the area ,1
since moving to korea in january 2017 this is by far the best spot in the area there is a great mix of local expats and travelers passing through incheon songdo leading to a never know who you might run into evening the location is a bit hidden for a first timer but that adds to the mystique once there the interior is intimate and welcoming there s also additional seating upstairs and a recently added dart machine for a fun competitive game with friends and for spring and fall there is outdoor seating as well you will appreciate the air conditioning indoors during the korean summer months don t miss out on the monthly trivia night as well for a good time with co workers or friends the food with the recently expanded menu is always great remember the cinder bar is a bar so the menu is very appropriate but don t let that fool you in terms of quality and taste my personal favorites are the colonel chicken sandwich and wings which remind of wings from back in the us the burger fish sandwich fish chips and fries are also favorites and give a variety of choices cost is very reasonable and appropriate on to the beer the cinder bar offers a dozen or so beers on tap and countless bottled beers the tap selection is vast from asia pac to europe to us to local craft and includes many types pilsner stout ipa porter wheat etc the whiskey selection is also extensive with many of my favorite single malt scotches and lastly the services is always phenomenal which is the main reason i return warren the owner and his staff are always welcoming to both regulars and first time visitors he goes out of his way to introduce himself and get to know his patrons so if you ve relocated to songdo or happen to be passing through i recommend an evening at the cinder bar ,1
cinder bar is the best place in songdo to chill out meet new people and enjoy some quality international beers oh wait did i mention they also make the best burger in town cinder is run by absolute legend warren along with his mate sam these guys are hard working honest kiwi blokes who always put their customers first warren even arranged free tickets to the baseball for me i ve spent the past 6 months living in songdo and visiting this bar on a semi frequent basis when i moved here i didn t know anybody now i m leaving korea and most of the people i know have all been cinder bar contacts through warren they show the baseball rugby and many other sports not to mention live bands and quiz nights this place has all the hallmarks of a western style bar but with a genuine korean welcome highly recommend you pay a visit any day of the week oh and say hi to warren and sam for me keep up the good work lads ,1
i have travelled all over the world been to countless bars pubs and restaurants the best way to describe the cinder bar is it s all of the above wrapped into a perfect little package of great times exceptional drinks and tasty food all in a warm extremely welcoming atmosphere warren and the entire staff at the cinder are excellent people and extremely personable they will go above and beyond to ensure that if you arrive a stranger you ll certainly leave as a friend this is clearly evident by patrons who return time after time again these people this place is clearly special and truly one in a million hope to see you at the cinder bar soon cheers ,1
i had a little trouble finding the place but once i did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet amazing the beer was ice cold and served in good portions beer price was a little steep for me but i hit happy hour just right so i got a bit of a break totally satisfied pro tip if you are trying to find it if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it s on the left side of the street before the bridge it s in a bit of an alcove in a housing development set back off the road a tad there s a sign the points left and i made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it s the first set of building after the bridge on the right the staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice the fish and chips are phenomenal did i mention the fish and chips are great you should definitely try the fish and chips ,1
if you re in the area be sure to visit warren is awesome always feels good to support a business where the owner sure cares about his work and the people who visit it and their friends thank you warren ,1
great bar friendly owner and staff make you feel welcome and will remember your name on your next visit cheers ,1
i was on business in korea and my work colleagues took me out for a beer after work arrived at the cinder bar which was my friend s regular primarily because it is one of the few true expat pubs in all of incheon the kiwi warren runs the pub and he was most hospitable we settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely even had time for some fish and chips the fish was covered in golden batter and the chips were delicious the bar looks a little broken down as was the area it was located in but that added to the charm if it was a rugby night you could watch the tv but it would ve been a bit of a squeeze there was also an upstairs loft style area overall a pleasant evening after work ,1
cozy bar with a very good selection of craft beers both on tap and in the bottle the owner warren is very friendly and makes you feel welcome the moment you step in the door it is easy to find and is popular with the locals and the expat crowd opens late and stays open late ,1
great expat bar the owner warren is a friendly kiwi who will remember your name from the first time you visit good beer selection great cocktails and the kitchen is getting better every month a very international crowd here i love stopping by every time i m in town ,1
i stopped in at the suggestion of coworkers i wasn t disappointed warren the owner gave me a warm greeting and took very good care of me the bar was a mix of local and expat patrons great selection of beer and although i didn t eat here from what i saw the food looked very good western style and people seemed to enjoy it i ll definitely go back the next time i m in incheon ,1
good option of bar for everyone in this city not just foreigners but also koreans i am a korean this bar has all the kinds of drinks you can imagine the drink prices are very good and the food prices are great too warren the owner speaks english and korean so he talks to everybody he is so popular that he could be the future mayor of incheon the music here is always good and the service is always excellent you have to come here ,1
good option of bar for the expat crowd nothing special pleasing mostly foreigners all kinds of drinks expensive and very small place but apparently the only option in town if you don t speak korean ,1
i have been to this bar twice and every time there were plenty of people especially foreigners the service is good and the quality of the products also ,1
perfect atmosphere food and exceptional customer service terrific bar menu beer selection cocktails etc great place ,1
if you aren t from korea this place will make you feel at home even mix of westerners and locals great place to grab a beer with existing friends and a great place to make new friends hats off to warren love your pub ,1
what a find the cinder bar is amid the high rise buildings stuffed with expensive restaurants massage places doctor s offices and just about everything else in this city there is a much better option the cinder bar is located on the ground level at the last building on the left side of the road just before the bridge as you leave incheon for the airport warren and his new partner sam have crafted this cozy establishment into a welcoming warm and friendly place to have a nice meal and a brew or two if you are in the mood they also have a superior selection of single malt whiskeys the prices are the best you will find in incheon and the atmosphere is unmatched the food is excellent as well this is a family affair and warren s wife is the establishment s cook of particular note is the new hamburger offered which is a new collaboration between warren and the flying chef it s easily the best burger in town should you decide to give the cinder bar a try i can guarantee you will have a new favorite hangout on your list ,1
it was full with clients that s why we got in we asked about lots of optional drinks and snacks trying not to eat anything unusual ,1
excellent place for g ts which feels a bit like a bubble somewhere outside south korea this is probably why so many expats hang around here the owner is a very friendly guy and admittedly one of the best gin and tonic gurus east of london ,1
i was at a conference in korea earlier this month and i was invited to this bar because one of the guys playing in the band was also at our conference with other people from the conference we went there and i had a great time the music was great the drinks were great and the vibe there was very chill and positive warren who i think is the owner was talking to us and making conversations with us and made us feel like we had been there before if i ever go back to korea i d definitely go there again ,1
cinder bar is a great bar to visit when in songdo it can be found near the center of the city by the bridge there is a good selection of beers and other drinks and warren is always thinking about bringing in new ones the owner warren is very friendly and open there are often quiz nights music and other events going on a great place to meet people as well it s worth a visit ,1
friendly staff good beer wine and cocktail menu sport shown on the big telly owned by a kiwi so good for rugby didn t eat so not sure about food ,1
i have been coming to this bar since late 2015 and i must say that i am continually impressed by the motivation and innovation of the staff here from a continually expanding drink menu which will have you staring at the pages for hours to the jazz nights and their trivia night cinder bar and its crew make every visit unique as a long time customer it is hard to be unbiased but the only advice i can offer is that whether you want to just go out and meet some new people prop up on a bar stool and down beers or sit at table and have some cocktails cinder is the only way to go ,1
the night i chose to check out this place happened to be warren s the owner s birthday the entire bar was more than happy to help him celebrate the people are extremely friendly when i first arrived i assumed that everyone in the bar were old friends i was traveling alone and it didn t take very long before a group invited me to hang out with them at their table turns out most people had just met that night everyone was just mingling i definitely recommend stopping in at cinder bar ,1
the cinder bar is a fantastic place to stop and make some new friends warren is the owner chances are he will personally greet you and make you feel like a long lost friend the patrons are a great mix of local and westerners very friendly he has all the liquid refreshments you could hope for and a satisfying menu i had a shrimp platter that was delicious aircrew are always welcome give it a try ,1
this bar came highly recommended from a workmate of mine so all my workmates were keen to see if it lived up to it s expectations i can say without a shadow of a doubt it is a fantastic little place the owner warren is the consummate host he delights in serving some fine local and imported craft beers and makes wicked cocktails thanks for the hangover looking forward to popping back to cinders in songdo to catch up with warren not looking forward to the hangover 5 stars ,1
warren runs a great place drinks food music all done with a passion he makes introductions i ended up talking to ups pilots all night about their cargo looking for investment ideas ,1
my year living in songdo would have been very different without cinder bar warren makes great drinks and the atmosphere is very relaxed with lots of friendly people if you re in incheon looking for a relaxed bar with great drinks great people and great food cinder is the place to go ,1
if you want to have a great time in incheon and you are foreign you should came to cinder bar ot s a great place to be and have a great time music is awesome you can meet people from all around and warren and his staff are super welcoming they also introduced me to some spanish speaking guests who are now my new friends for the next three months while i am here in korea here for business thank you cinder bar br si desean pasar un ageadable momento en incheon deben venir a este bar la musica es espectacular y warren el dueño es extremadamente amable conoce a la gente del bar y te puede presentar a personas que hablan tu idioma ,1

okay so here we are in incheon and we want a cold beverage and something to eat we ve been here quite a few times and haven t been too lucky we check out trip advisor and guess who s 1 cinder bar we re reading the reviews and warren the owner s name keeps popping up we head out to find the cinder bar we walk in and are instantly greeted by guess who warren he is one passionate and friendly man he wants us to enjoy ourselves the music was so great we were hungry and he recommended a few items and they were delicious warren is known for his famous gin and tonic i m not a fan of gin he insisted we try just one which we shared i slurped it down and now i like gin and tonics we ordered his homemade dip and chips chicken wings and fish and chips all very very good warren we re spreading the word we had so much fun ,1

warren is lovely and the atmosphere is perfect for post school gatherings the sliders are just the tastiest thing both beef and fish i especially enjoy the ginger lemon something yummy drink ,1
the cinder bar is basically a pub for the expat community their target is the very small foreign residents of the city so you won t see many locals great variety of beers and they often organize events for alcohol lovers ,1
me and my partner are from england and we were recommend the cinder bar from some friends the owner warren is from new zealand and is a great character to have a chatter with over a good spirit cocktail he s super passionate about cocktails whiskey gin you name it he can make it he made us feel so welcome straight away and we ended up staying there until 4am i think sorry warren d great for expats to get a good drink d,1

the cinder bar features some of the best mixed drinks i ve ever tasted ask for the gin and tonic or signature long island ice tea made with all top shelf ingredients the best part of this bar though is that warren and his staff take time to get to know you when you come back they remember your name and you can practically pick up your last conversation where you left off even if its been awhile you feel like you re among friends from the moment you step through the door don t miss out on this great spot in songdo ,1

irrespective of whether you are a local an expat living in korea or just passing through the area you really should be visiting the cinder bar put simply you won t find a warmer welcome a nicer atmosphere or a more enjoyable environment to spend an evening in the thing that really stands out about the place is that the team there are clearly genuinely interested in you having a good time whilst you are there and go out of their way to show warmth and friendliness irrespective of if you are a regular or a visitor from out of town food is tasty drinks are excellent cocktails are made with care and attention to detail prices are extremely reasonable too the really nice thing about the place is that the positivity is infectious not only are the staff incredibly friendly and helpful but this rubs off on the clientele too it really does feel like a little community if you are looking to spend an enjoyable time in the area this is the first place to visit ,1

a little bar tucked under an apartment building run by super friendly kiwi warren wazza and the crew go out of their way to look after you from remembering your drinks favourites to dishing up excellent bar food as well and even ringing around for other late night bars to find who was open when it was time to move on ,1
in korea for presidents cup and went to the cinder bar after dinner great bar with a really fun atmosphere the owner and bartender warren goes out of his way to make sure every customer has fun and the gin tonics are out of this world if you are in this area and want a relaxing drink go see warren at the cinder bar ,1
great little spot kind of hidden basically the first place on the new city side of the bridge good food good drinks but like everything in korea it is small compared to american standards no worries if the weather is nice you can spill out onto the street ,1
excellent gin kraken and cocktails good bar food too i recommend the cinder shrimp wonderful company too warren and the team are great ,1
warren welcomed all of us and made us enjoy our time at the cinder bar the chicken wings were amazing so we had to go back there again thea same night for more wings thank you for your hospitality and kindness ,1
the owner is incredibly sweet and caring you can see it in how he talks to his guests and how he cares deeply about his business and the community of songdo i was studying abroad in songdo for about a year and i can easily say that going to the cinder bar made me feel right at home and also very welcomed in a country place that i was new to warren is not only kind but also innovative the food is delicious i can t get enough of the fry dip and he always had a new drink recommendation for me and my friends that we always loved he is always reaching higher and making the cinder bar a fun exciting and comfortable place to meet up with friends and enjoy the night highly recommend definitely swing by ,1
hannah and warren are doing a great job building upon what luke and his team started there s always a warm welcome and good mixed company the interesting range of drinks available traverse the globe too from serving korea s maxx new zealand beers and decent scotch whiskey to manhattans and warrens signature cocktails and now you can enjoy tasty food there too would i recommend a visit definitely from meeting people in the community and watching a rugby match to having a quiet drink this bar has it all and the playlist pleases too probably why it s been our local for over a year ,1
the cinder bar is full of character just like its owner who generates a fantastic atmosphere each drink is spectacular ,1
i first came here back in may and now i am one of the regulars i love it some of my new best friends i met at the cinder bar the owners warren and hanna are always lovely and are introducing new cinderites to us all the time the drink selection is fantastic i personally enjoy the monteith s selection from new zealand especially the radler food wise the wings are my favorite but it s the cinder sauce that make them absolutely divine the cinder bar is the new mover and shaker in the city of songdo check it out now ,1
the beer is reasonably priced including a few new zeeland made beers you can t get anywhere else in songdo if you are feeling hungry they offer a couple options including some killer wings that come with a their own unique cinder sauce the real highlight of cinder bar is the service the owner warren is there every night and he is by far the best bartender in incheon he is warm friendly and never let s an empty glass sit despite being born in new zeeland he has lived in korea long enough to speak fluent korean because of this the atmosphere is unique it s not just a foreigner bar every member of the cinder crew can speak english and korean so both locals and foreigner mingle in roughly equal proportions ,1

initially we had some trouble finding the place it s tucked around in back of the building not in the front we called and warren s wife came around the block to meet us and lead the way how s that for service warren came over and welcomed us immediately upon arrival making us feel right at home he asked us about our normal drink preferences then made some suggestions and headed off to get them we tried several different beers and of course had some pub grub the burgers and shrimp scampi are great good portions and lots of options to wash it all down we met serval of the locals regulars who are all super friendly and fun to hang with all in all a great time with great food also wonderful owners who truly enjoy taking care of their customers and doing everything they can to make your experience a great one ,1

cinder bar has a great vibe and the owner warren went out of his way to chat with us the drinks were all made from scratch and were better than any other place that i have been to incheon if you are in songdo then this is definitely the place to go for good drinks and a good time ,1
the cinder bar is an excellent place to unwind after a hard day at the office or just a fun place to spend a saturday afternoon night meeting new people awesome atmosphere good people good music good times ,1
must visit place if you are feeling lost in an alien land warren the owner is an excellent host he and his wife manage this place and you always feel at home with them i gave him a surprise by calling him by his name in first visit came to know thro the reviews but believe me he will remember your name even if you visit after a year the beer is good so is the food nicely selected by warren and prepared by his wife,1
i can t really say enough about this establishment the atmosphere and the staff s enthusiasm makes this a must see while in songdo the food is great the beer selection is spot on and the conversation is second to none i frequent this pub every time i travel to korea so get off your duff and mosey on down to the cinder bar oh and ask for the killer cinder gin and tonic ,1

had an overnight layover in incheon and was looking for a spot to get out of the airport as we had a room at the transit hotel after getting a stamp on our boarding card from the airline needed we were allowed to leave the airport warren the owner gave our uber driver directions on how to get to the bar 20 min from the airport kitchen open late for fish chips and wings great alcohol selection ipa imported from the u s on tap great spot and will come back next time we have an overnight layover on delta or korean air great mix of locals and expats a must see on the the way through ,1
in town for a conference and spent some time searching for a place to have a drink uncovered cinders after a detailed search but surprised that they weren t top of the search owner warren an extremely friendly and welcoming host a range of beers to cater for taste and an even better selection of spirits for even the most discerning palate i started with a malty indiga american craft served with some dubiously crunchy typically korean nuts and graduated through guinness and stella artois to an extremely reasonably priced local lager even a selection of scottish beers and islay malt whiskeys for the more selective drinker would highly recommend the venue to anyone ,1
delicious meal best dish marinated bbq great service to give you an idea some korean friends recommended the place to me definitely will come back ,1
would totally recommend for couples friends and families the service was great the food was brilliant and prices were fair for the great food provided ,1
looked disappointing on arrival but inside was better busy and a lovely atmosphere the food was lovely and very good service ,1
it was not the best korean food i had but i would go back place was busy people without reservations were turned away i got lucky because i was dining alone service was good ,1
went here for a family birthday and got platter of meat to share i enjoyed the simple combination of really good meat with fresh asian style salad which the staff were always quick to top up i felt that some of the meats could have come with more sauces or marinades but it was my first time having korean barbecue style and maybe that s normal i don t know but i d be eager to try more and find out ,1
a hidden gem food and service were both great it is a small restaurant and fills up fast so be sure to book the kimchi pancake was excellent good quality meet and the banchan sides were also really good i will return soon ,1
we visit this restaurant when we are in edinburgh we love the food we love the people and we just love sitting as a family cooking our meats on the grill in the table the endless salad is just delicious the starters are fantastic especially the takoyaki octopus and then we always have the d set menu of mixed meats pork belly marinated pork marinated beef marinated chicken and little steaks fabulous will see you again soon ,1
went again just after christmas this place never stops being my favourite tried bibimbap this time the portion size was great and the flavour amazing friends got bulgogi and soups seafood pancake always wonderful i will keep going if they will ever offer delivery service will be the end of me i ll eat korean every day ,1
very nice food and great concept service could be a bit more attentive but overall we had a great evening ,1
we decided to try this korean bbq place after last night not so good food at the other restaurant well i must say it s good juice marinated ribs nice and tasty spicy beef stew ,1
small busy place book in advance excellent menu we opted for a platter of meats you cook yourself at the table what a great experience loved it to bits the garnishes were excellent as was the service ,1
wow that s really the most amazing asian restaurant i discovered in edinburgh friendly environment wonderful cuisine reasonable prices the food is fresh and delicious you can decide to go for one of the share bbq platter or for traditional korean dishes in any case it will be a perfect choice it s preferable to book in advance ,1
walked in when they opened at 5pm place became busy after a few minutes uber driver guessed that we were going to a korean restaurant as he said the street is a quiet street but he has dropped off a few passengers there so must be good he said we had korean bbq that came with side dishes and kimchi jigae great tasting good quality meat simple decor in the restaurant but i was after good food staff attentive and helpful recommended place ,1
called in here on a monday night 5pm when the doors open we where in only 5mins and the place was full so maybe book in advance nice clean restaurant had the house bbq that s comes with a korean beer included good selection of meats and side plates,1
very disappointing we arrived sunday late afternoon the staff could not have been more disinterested despite only a few tables occupied the waitress was more interested in talking to other staff members than take our order the restaurant was physically cold a couple at the next table had to put on their outdoor coats after ordering the electric grill took an age to warm up and when the food arrived full meat platter half of it was still frozen obviously previously band saw freezer cut no marinade for a restaurant that claims to be a barbaque the meat was given shockingly no thought oddly butchered cuts that could not be cooked without undercooking one half or overcooking the other service continued to be at best minimal the grill was occasionally manned by a member of staff taking away the one gimmick the style of cuisine has who left without any word when we took to cooking our own cuts of meat we were sternly told on how to operate the grill as we obviously missed the 12 week preparatory course for dining we left with most of the meal uneaten the waitress did not ask why or if the meal was saitisfactory i d like to personally apologise for interrupting her 8 hour paid social club if the idea of being exposed to cooking yourself is some kind of wild evening entertainment and you don t mind that there are far better places to actually eat i d highly recommend korean bbq ,1
i love korean food and this was recommended by a friend while visiting it was top quality very tender meat and great service ,1
i have been several times to south korea and love the korean food this restaurant was serves the closest authentic galbi korean bbq you can wish for my friends loved it ,1
myself and my partner were visiting edinburgh we stayed 3 nights in total out of those 3 nights we went to korean bbq for dinner twice that s how good it was the restaurant is small so definitely book in advance it was full both of the nights we went compared to kbbq in other cities we have travelled to this one was definitely more affordable and worth the price ,1
really cute cosy wee place and really cool with your own individual bbqs on each table very different and defiantly worth the experience ,1
started off goodish they took full order then 5 mins later said had no chicken skewers for starters so we both took chicken dumplings then while ordering food started telling me i was ordering too much i was ordering for 3 people strange the dumplings were good except one person asked for veg dumpling but got chicken it s a birthday she didn t complain then the bbq food started to arrive but one of hot plates would only go to number two a warm setting when we complained as food was poaching not browning were told they knew it was broken so just use other one for 8 people we asked to move then every member of staff stood round our table telling us it will heat up give it time eventually they tried to intimidate us with restaurant and kitchen crew huddling round us they said give us 2 separate tables then they were shouting tried to move another table threw the cooking food on top of the raw food aggressively at that point we said we wanted to leave and they had spoiled his birthday we found a better staffed restaurant to celebrate and will never eat there again ,1
this is where i always enjoy korean food the most always been in the tarvit street branch i was never disappointed food quality is great i tried bbq sets and bulgogi dishes so far they were always really tasty last time i got beef bulgogi seafood pancake that i adore and a soup everything was just great little space so if you don t book sometimes it s a bit of a risk but it s really easy to book online the service was great everyone always friendly and welcoming really nice a cosy atmosphere it s not the cheapest place to eat but the quality is outstanding that every single penny is worth it i really look forward to try the new branch as well this place never disappoint ,1
excellent food eel hot pot is delicious good service good food i will come again thank you very much,1
everything was super good people of the restaurant is super kind 100 recommended i m happy of going that place ,1
i came here 3 times with friends and had great experiences with this place i loved bbq pork cooked by myself on the electric barbi and the spicy kimchi soup the staffs were very friendly and helpful too i know i definitely need to wash my hair after leaving the restaurant but i will certainly go back again and again ,1
as the name suggests each table has an electric barbi on which you cook your selected meats excellent variety and the food was well prepared and very fresh great fun and the family enjoyed the whole experience waiter was extremely helpful friendly and attentive price reasonable for what we got will visit again booking almost essential ,1
we brought a few friends who had never tried a korean bbq before and they were very impressed by the food it was reasonably priced we got some things for the grill and a main meal which was very filling the side dishes were excellent and the servers were very good about changing the grill often for us a good time to go would be earlier on in the evening when it isn t too busy as the staff were very attentive and efficient will definitely be back ,1
my husband and myself went this evening as a walk in i assume it was busy with reservations as we were asked if we could be out by 8pm and this was just turned 7pm no one really explained why we ordered 1 starter which came very quickly as did the drinks my main came 10 mins before my husbands but i assume as his was fried this was the reason for the delay no one explained why the food was very tasty drinks a good variety and reasonably priced cannot really comment on staff as not a lot of interaction after our mains we asked for the bill as it was 7 40 and did not look at desert coffee menu would definitely come back but would reserve a table at a less busy time ,0
i visited with my partner for his first time having korean bbq and my first time in this country i have had this many times before as i used to live in south korea we ordered a mixed meat plate which came with two beers for 42 and we ordered rice and kimchi as well the food was plentiful and offered a good mix the lettuce sauces and sides were topped up for free the service was excellent with frequent grill changes and the food compared favourably to bbq i have eaten in south korea my partner very much enjoyed his first korean bbq and would come again i was initially a bit apprehensive as it was empty at 5pm and doesn t have a great exterior but i am glad we came in highly recommended i just wish we d had space for the kimchi pancake ,1
i m in two minds about this place staff were friendly it was packed and some of the food was very nice and the salads plentiful the first time in the uk that i ve tasted kimchi which actually had some kick to it the pudding menu is very limited but some really unusual flavours black sesame or red bean ice cream anyone however some of the meat wasn t well cut was therefore awkward on the barbeque and the overall value of the barbeque was poorer tan some i ve had dishes arrived a little haphazardly and one a couple of times things were forgotten though came quickly after a prompt overall a pleasant evening but wouldn t go out of my way to come here again when there is so much other choice in the city ,0
the food was excellent the best food we ever had the staffs was so lovely friendly and very welcoming the price is so reasonable and would recommend to anyone ,1
have wanted to try korean bbq for a while this was brilliant we got a mixed meat platter for 20 00 each we received free top up sides and beer each the meat was lovely and it was a really nice way to eat interestingly the more you ate the better it became and the more you wanted to keep eating would highly recommend as great value for money very filling and a really nice experience ,1
i ve had korean bbq before its not really my thing since i can cook reasonably well at home so there s little fun in doing this in a restaurant however my teenage daughters fondness for k pop made her ask to go here we went table was ok place was light and airy we saw about twelve ingredients on display for the customers to add to their meals soy and chili coriander spring onions oyster sauce two red bean sauces and so on nothing really exotic and nothin particularly korean supermarkets have most of these ingredients nowadays we ordered tempura starters and although huge and expensive for starters they weren t awfully good tempura batter was darker oilier and heavier than the best i ve had particularly for the prawns my veg tempura was a little better but still not great we ordered beef mains meagre portions considering other places in edinburgh offer more variety we got three bowls of lukewarm sticky rice which was more badly made than actually sticky i can make better at home and i expect better from restaurants i won t come here again the korean beer we wanted was out of stock our starters arrived several minutes apart and the nice waiting staff told me the kitchen was busy there was about ten more diners in the place than we three we had pints of diet coke each bill was pricey for what we received although average for the typical fare sadly this place was below par ,0
fantastic meal ordered a verity of marinated meats along with some sides fantastic food i have never visited a korean bbq restaurant before and this has really surprised me great food and fairly inexpensive the staff were also very friendly and didn t give me too many bad looks for my inability to use chopsticks ,1
great little restaurant cook your own bbq meat which would be fun for a group lots of other dishes available fresh and tasty ask if you don t want it too spicy or ask for extra if you like it a little hotter free sides dishes good korean tea snd the seafood pancake delicious cash only will make a return visit opening offer 10 off the bill gunbae ,1
food is decent and fun to cook on the bbq really good value and service was great not blown away by the food but would definitely return,1
i went here with my friend during the winter for korean bbq true to its name the beef bbq i ordered was way too salty and the some was the meat was not marinated the amount of meat was too little in comparison to its price and other korean restruants in the city the waiters were not friendly and when the chef came out to greet us he was really odd and we felt really uncomfortable due to his attitude towards us don t think we want to come back here again ,0
absolutely majestic experience the staff were lovely and the food was equally outstanding the cook it yourself factor significantly spiced up our dining experience and added a touch of fun to the table great place 10 10 would recommend ,1
looks a bit grim from outside but once you go in its bustling and lively very good food huge portions for the meal set d probably would feed 3 or 4 not the recommended 2 the place is relatively small and was very busy on a tuesday night booking recommended ,1
busy quirky little restaurant excellent value for money fresh tasty food cooking on the bbq what s not to love ,1
it was amazing for me and my family as first timers eating korean bbq staff was nice and friendly the food was delicious b set is full of beef meat and the toppings were nice overall it was nice strongly recommended if you want to eat korean food ,1
went here with 7 friends service was quick and efficient we all went for the set bbq menu and it was delicious side dishes were delivered but we weren t sure what we were supposed to do with them until a pour waitress explained how it all was done we all enjoyed barbecuing our own food at the table and all agreed that we d definitely go back again ,1
we found this restaurant just by googling and we were very impressed we ordered set d which was a great combination of really fresh meat and was great if you re not sure what to order the side dishes were delicious too especially the salad and the marinated beansprouts and the sauce was so tasty we ordered rice as well but it really wasn t necessary as the set itself is a very generous portion for 2 hungry full grown men i have sadly never been to korea but i have eaten at barbecue restaurants in the korean district of tokyo and this competes with the best of them the staff were very attentive and friendly and keen to recommend delicious authentic combinations of meat and side dishes all this for a very reasonable price we ll definitely be back ,1
service was great food was great literally would change nothing about the food or service would definitely recommend ,1
no website so we needed to book by actually going there it is a very popular place so booking is needed the food was excellent the staff were helpful and knowledgeable and the experience was very enjoyable ,1
avoid it we just randomly walked in seeing many people there so we really thought this should be a good place for food however the food there made us soooo disappointed we ordered four dishes and none of them tasted okay the bbq source was so weird and the beef was not fresh at all as for the beef soup i would say they destroyed every thing it was so slight and there was not enough ingredients inside all in all i don t recommend it this restaurant is unqualified ,0
my brother took me here for my belated birthday meal service was good food was excellent and the new experience was well worth the five stars i would recommend to anyone looking to try korean bbq ,1
we ate at this korean bbq restaurant the other night with friends you cook your own food if you pick a bbq dish service was very mixed girl waitress was excellent organised and efficient but the other staff not quite so some were just lazy asked to get table cleared after main course as they left it on table for 20 mins even though the restaurant was quieter the youngest staff cleared 1 4 of table after requested then proceeded to stand around and do nothing for next 10 mins eventually got table cleared including glasses with wine remaining in them after requesting again awful attention to guests food was a different case bbq chicken was a generous portion bbq prawns not so only 6 medium prawns for the money stir fry was generous portion and tasty restaurant really has to sort out service as we left thinking there are better korean bbq restaurants near by so why would we go here again tip should be given in cash if added to visa staff do not get it owner told me which is fair enough if cash they get it legal requirement in uk anyway ,1
their food is absolutely amazing very friendly environment and staffs good price would 100 definitely visit again if we visit edinburgh highly recommended the only thing is that they have bbq at the dining table but they didn t have the exhaust fan for it which makes all the clothes smell like bbq when you walk out off the restaurant ,1
my friends and i visited this restaurant as a wedding anniversary meal 12 of us in total it was a walk and welcoming atmosphere food and drinks were served very quickly and it was absolutely amazing from start to finish the service was incredible ,1
three of us went for dinner having the kimchi pancake very generous with the kimchi and not too spicy if that s something you re worried about the bbq set d and the naengmyun cold noodles in a vinegar broth the pancake was delicious and probably the best i have had outside of korea and the set includes a variety of 5 cuts of meat the pork neck slice is especially tender and delicious and 2 beers of your choice this was an extremely generous portion and undoubtedly worth the price a great option if you re new to kbbq and aren t sure what cuts to order the set also comes with all you need for ssam lettuce wraps and the side dishes are also of a great quality and are refilled for free if you ask the naengmyun is also probably the best i ve ever had i highly recommend the service was great very attentive and friendly explaining how to use the bbq and changing out the grill halfway through to a cleaner one something i was very impressed by as many korean restaurants don t do that in the u k overall i was extremely impressed and would even consider it the best korean restaurant i ve been to outside of korea ,1
i ve eaten here a couple of times now and both times were a pleasure the food was excellent and the staff were very helpful and welcoming i d highly recommend it and i ll definitely be returning here in the future ,1
my second visit just as good as the first friendly service good prices love the bbq experience highly recommended,1
amazing restaurant the waiters were very nice and we re all very careful with my allergies to sesame telling me exactly what i could and couldn t eat they also helped on how to use the barbaque at the start the food was very nice and you get all the necessary vegetables and lettuce needed for the meat lovely place overall 10 10 would visit again,1
haven t tried korean food in a korean restaurant before and was thoroughly impressed we visited on a saturday evening but however i did not reserve a table so my advice would be to do so as it was busy i managed to get a slot at 8 o clock and eagerly returned the atmosphere was electric the bbq s which acted as a lively centrepiece for each table were producing an enticing aroma which elevated our appetite we ordered the sirloin to bbq and the rice cakes the sirloin was nicely marbled and marinated in a delicious sauce it was served with lettuce leaves kimchi salad and bean sprouts all were delectable the rice cakes were chewy and tasty perhaps a little too sweet for my liking as i prefer hot spicy food but still so delicious we got octopus balls and dumplings for starters which were both so incredibly yummy nothing was disappointing i can t say a bad word all customers were smiling and laughing the staff were incredibly helpful and polite the pricing was extremely fair an excellent meal and a great introduction to korean cooking ,1
amazingly good korean bbq the staff was incredibly friendly and the food itself was just absolutely amazing my friend and i shared a bbq set b and the kimchi pancakes it was soooo good will definitely visit again next time in edinburgh i would consider booking in advance ,1
out in edinburgh for a gig and decided to try something a wee bit different than the usual pub grub and have to say i was very impressed with what was our first ever korean bbq we went for the the bbq set meal d for 2 which came with to beers and prices at 38 80 was great value for what was served up the only thing that we made a mistake on was not ordering side dishes of rice noodles as wasn t sure what the set meal came with lol the wee bbq plate in the middle of the table was quick to heat up and did not make the dining area to hot to enjoy your meal the marinaded beef slice was outstanding and watch out for the chicken as it s bloody spicy well for my mouth anyway lol this restaurant is very busy and we were lucky to get a table for 2 not long after opening time so i would suggest phoning to make a reservation to make sure you re not disappointed ,1
it is my second time there the staff is still as friendly and helpful the food is incredibly fresh and tasty and it seems like an authentic korean experience considering the menu it is quite small which make it very cosy and creates a greta atmosphere ,1
uninspiring looking from outside but i am glad someone had recommended it to me you barbecue your food on a grill in the table and staff were very helpful explaining how to do it delicious flavours that were new to my palate i thoroughly enjoyed it ,1
the first time i came here delicious food kindness service and staff very friendly the best korean bbq i was ate much better than almost korean bbq in london highly recommend for everyone love korean bbq ,1
the food here is honestly amazing and i have been here twice with friends and family i order bbq items each time i go and the spicy squid and chicken and pork are nice but the spicy chicken is slightly overpriced as you only get 2 slices sometimes it is hard to catch the attention of the staff but the people here are really friendly ,1
this was my third visit i have nothing negative to say the restaurant doesn t look much from outside but once your inside the number of asian people who were dining speaks for itself it is very busy and booking is essential the food is amazing everything tastes different even the free salad i would recommend this restaurant 100 ,1
a wonderful family meal for 4 we had the d set meat selection from the menu which was certainly enough for 4 of us the meat were all very tender and marinates were delicious the side dishes were all superb too salads radish and i ordered extra kimchi which was delicious the staff were very helpful and accommodating the value for the quality that we received was very good indeed ,1
one of the best korean bbqs i ve visited their bulgogi marinade is absolutely on point and the kimchi pancake was wonderful we ordered the mixed meats set menu for 2 and were treated to a quick overview of how to cook our food we d been to a korean bbq before so didn t need the full demonstration our grill plate was frequently refreshed and all the meat was absolutely top quality the pancake appetizer took awhile to come out but we were given a bowl of amazingly tangy kimchi to make up for the wait perfect spice great texture and flavour the staff is charming and helpful and the food was perfectly composed finish off your lettuce and sauces no problem they ll bring you more right away if you enjoy cooking and like to play with your food this is a perfect night out just be sure to come with an appetite that set meal for 2 is really enough for 3 or even 4 people ,1
we had the korean bbq beef and pork which was nice and taste although i think it s a bit over priced for what it is especially i am cooking the food myself ,1
i m a huge fan of korean food and have been in too many korean restaurants to count in many cities dublin tokyo osaka austria london manchester seoul etc and this one is a definite 5 star it was very authentic we were also the only two non korean people in the entire restaurant which was full and booked out for the night which must mean that this place is the real deal we ordered the kimchi pancake and tofu bibimbap both of which tasted just like in korea i savoured every bite not all korean restaurants outside korea seem to give the complimentary starters but korean bbq does which was great the prices were standard each main ranging around 10 12 the service was efficient and good no complaints a word of warning this place is extremely popular even on weekdays we came on a saturday to find it booked out so i made a reservation the following monday online which was ok while we were there the place was a full house and the waitress was turning down those without reservations as it was booked out until around 8 30pm the online booking is easy and quick it fills up fast i booked two days in advance for a monday night and the latest available was 6 30pm with nothing available any later so i advise booking quite a bit in advance or be ready to eat either early or late as the 7 9pm times seem to get taken fast as the restaurant is small and seems to be very popular with koreans in edinburgh as well as tourists and locals ,1
we had a reservation but turned out it wasn t needed the food was great overall good value the service could ve been a bit faster the kimchi was a bit more sour than spicy and not as crunchy but it s up to personal taste i think they could serve kimchi as a complimentary sider to the bbq as they would also in korea some music would be nice ,1
we really enjoyed our dinner here the hostess owner was great we ordered the platter for two that included two beers my wife does not drink beer so it was a win win the food was flavorful and fresh and we had fun cooking it our server refilled the vegetable sides as needed well worth the money,1
this is one of your typical grill your own korean places meat is fresh portions are large and the prices are reasonable only 3 sides with the meat less than what i usually get they could also use another server but overall a good non tourist experience ,1
my friend visited from the usa where there are many korean bbq places she took me here to experience it and we were very happy food is good very filling and the staff are friendly when we arrived we were told the small restaurant was full but instead of just turning us away the staff took my contact number and called us when a table became free a very nice idea meaning we could explore a bit more ,1
i love this place and remind me a bbq place in daegu that i used to go to the meat choices are great and we had a lot of fun cooking and it s a good chat waiter was so kind to offer extra salad if we needed more side salads taste great will recommend ,1
i had never been to a korean bbq before so the entire experience was new to us luckily the staff is very friendly and helpful and they were there to assist us in preparing our meal you have a heating plate built into the center of each table on which you barbecue your own food meat prawns etc or you can order one of the prepared stir fried dishes one of us had the bbq and the other got stir fried we both extremely enjoyed our meals whether you have stir fried or bbq the korean way of eating it is by placing some of your cooked meal on a lettuce leaf adding some of the condiments they bring you spicy radish bean sprouts sauce rolling it up and eating the roll very tasty and a fun interesting way to eat to boot the prices were also quite reasonable highly recommended ,1
we were there with 13 guys we ordered a mix of meat and fish and that was very good the people were very friendly and gave us good information about the menu s we ve been twice now ,1
although it is an electric bbq in the centre of the table this is still a great experience good menu with choices with selections for two that was adequate for three of us food comes raw and you cook it yourself to your liking the grill is changed regularly so you don t have to deal with burnt scraps although the waiter was attentive in that respect they were a bit slow with us having to ask to clear the table ask for the dessert menu ask to order our dessert and then ask for the bill only to have go to the counter to pay in order to get our taxi however would still recommend that you give it a try ,1
if it wasn t for the reviews of this place we wouldn t have tried it looks not a lot from the exterior but the whole experience of having your own personal bbq on you table to the delicious meats you can try it was absolutely fantastic definitely worth a visit if looking for something different we booked a table for around 4pm which in our opinion was a great time not too busy and you didn t feel rushed staff were very helpful and even called us a taxi to the playhouse after our meal which was fantastic and saved us a very wet walk through the city if you are looking for something different from a chain restaurant and a little taste of korean food then definitely take a trip here you ll love it ,1
delicious korean food in edinburgh surprisingly delicious bulgogi stone rice and soup were all delicious so glad we found korean food in scotland ,1
just such nice people even let us stay a bit long but just the nicest people and the nicest place don t rush your meal enjoy the place and the people even taught us how to cook the food to perfection deffo go again ,1
my husband and i came at teatime before the theatre staff were friendly enough and the chef very helpful in helping my husband with the bbq all meals were very tasty it all felt very authentic would try again ,1
i went here with my daughter and two of her friends from university in california anna who is from south korea did the honours and ordered for all of us great ribeye short rib and marinated fillet accompanying pickled veg was excellent lots of soft fluffy rice the chilli paste was very tasty as well if you like korean and you love bbq beef then give it a go value for money for four people ,1
i have been twice now and both times ordered a set of mixed meats set d i believe to bbq out of this the sliced beef is defiantly the best the goyzas are also yummy unlike when i have had korean bbq in asia here there are no extractors above the tables which does lead to a slightly smokey atmosphere and you defiantly leave smelling of a garlic y bbq but all in all a great find for some fun and tasty food ,1
after a colleague recommmeded this restaurant we decided to chance our luck with a last minute booking for seven of us the staff were very friendly and accommodating and fitted us in at our table we opted for a couple of mixed meat cook at table bbq dishes and all the meat was great this was more than enough for four of us the other three opted for their own dishes which also looked very appetising great little find and i m sure i ll be back ,1
we went to this restaurant thanks to tripadvisor recommandations but we were very disapointed by the food we ordered 2 c set beef bbq for 2 people and the quantity was very small plus the food was not very tasty we were forced to have another d set mixed meat for 2 this time there was enough quantity for 2 but the quality was not there to conclude i would not recommend it it was also a bit expensive ,0
ate here before the theatre a random week night in chilly edinburgh at 6 00 no need to book i thought well as they had online booking decided i might as well and although there was one free table it looks like booking was a wise decision it s a small cozy space with friendly staff who talked us through the menu as we had never eaten in a korean restaurant before prawn starter was magnificent and easily enough for two followed by the korean bbq neatly fitted into the table top a decent bottle of reasonably priced house wine what s not to like ,1
the smell which hits you as you walk through the door is similar to that of teriyaki which makes your mouth water we opted for bbq and ordered a set of mixed meats and also sliced beef accompanied by goyzas both chicken and vegetables plus an aubergine the bbq grill is electric and we felt was never sizzlingly hot like in asia where they are mostly gas powered there are no extractors over the tables therefore the whole place is really smokey with 12 grills on the go your clothes will whiff the service was a little sporadic all in all pretty good for somewhere out of asia ,1
delicious food can not fault anything tried stuff i never thought i d eat lovely polite attentive staff perfect place for couples families and people who would like to experience korean food ,1
our first visit and we were not disappointed lovely selection of foods to choose from staff friendly and helpful we ordered a sharing platter with a few starters too cooked our combo meats ourself which was different lovely food and enjoyable experience for mothers day,1
wonderful staff great food and amazing experience cozy atmosphere and very authentic 10 10 would recommend,1
we were very impressed by the taste of korea in edinburgh we opted for the tofu seafood soup packed full of flavour the complimentary side dishes were also delicious,1
restarant is comfortable staff very friendly i came with my girlfriend and we had great time i gave 5 stars and would recommend to have korean bbq here ,1
second visit here tuesday night and it s packed last time we got a bbq for two and starters we only just managed to eat all this this time i opted for a stew my ptnr went for some sort of spicy chicken thing and we had dumpling starters and a kumchi side as last time we got three different salads that came with the food free refills of same which we made use of dressings in salad all different but are lovely sweet sour salty combos go with everything lots of korean diners and other folk who know their stuff but i think you would be well looked after if you hadn t a clue staff checked we were ok both visits and checked if we wanted chopsticks or knife fork spoon be aware that in common with many korean restaurants your clothes and hair will smell after don t wear anything like a doen jacket that needs special cleaning we recently went to another new korean bbq in edinburgh but this place totally outguns it 2 starters 2 mains side salads come with it and we got a drink each 40 total ,1
visited with fiancé one of my friends recommended me this restaurant i wanted to eat something authentic and this place was indeed authentic the restaurant itself is not too big but looks cozy we tried 2 different kind of ramens some kimchi and korean green tea latte the drink was amazing the food even better their tempura is so tasty i keep telling my man to go back to get more i would definitely recommend ,1
we had the korean bbq menu d for 2 people with 2 beers each and more than we could eat all for under 50 the waiters were so friendly and helpful showing us how to use the bbq and talking us through all the pickles and seasoning the food was absolutely delicious and the korean beer was good too at the end the staff called us a taxi they couldn t do enough to help the only thing to note is that it was cash only so make sure you take enough cash with you but definitely go also it really would be hard for vegetarians ,1
my friends and i are regulars at kbbq and although their normal dishes are very good we love the korean barbeque the most it s super fun to cook the meat yourself although if you re nervous the staff will jump in to help or cook it for you if you prefer even as a group of students we find we can all leave full and happy for around 10 20 per person depending on how greedy we are about the meat selection a great place to spend some quality time with friends or family and enjoy crazy tasty food all the while ,1
the waiter was very informative and would recommend their bbq we paid just under 60 with drinks bbq and two meals with a starter which is fairly good i would recommend booking it as the place is quite small ,1
first visit and our family of four adults came as part of an evening out in edinburgh to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday the menu is varied for both carnivores and vegetarian options we tried the barbeque at the table and this added to the experience as well as the flavor with staff attentive and helpful to make sure the food was prepared properly cooked well but not singed and smokey marinades flavoursome with just the right amount of bite and side veg dishes crispy and tastey we had dumplings and seaweed salad to start finished with black sesame ice cream i have travelled in asia and experienced authentic local dishes and this was on par smiling staff and service was great we will definitely return would be good for a light lunch or as we had a full evening meal ,1
visited today two hours before or reservation but the staff were happy to accommodate us we had the beef bbq set meal and it was great staff and food were excellent can t fault it ,1
brought my sister here for her first korean bbq experience and i m really happy i did they offer different bbq sets which are really good value for money and they have chamisul soju which is my personal favourite staff are friendly and offer to show you how to use the grill on the table good quality meat only issue i had were there were only 3 side dishes and kimchi was extra overall a good experience ,1
a place full of buzz with an extensive well described menu catering for a whole range of tastes the service was first rate helpful explanations given and an attentiveness that was never over bearing the menu allows for lots of welcome experimentation first class overall ,1
this place is amazing to say the least we d never been to a korean bbq before so didn t know what to expect but what a great experience it was and we had such a great time we ordered beef slices king prawns seaweed two portions of rice and two grape juices all of this coming with free sides and sauces the beef and prawns were beautifully marinated and the staff was very helpful in showing us how to cook as it was our first time the rice was excellent and the seaweed was as well despite not liking it much myself would highly recommend getting the grape juice as well if you re looking for something non alcoholic tasted great and even had little grapes inside the can which added to the experience of a different culture overall i must say that this place is a true wonder with a great variety of food friendly staff and excellent little details such as the metal chopsticks and drinks being served in their original can bottle covered in korean japanese writing and for a very filling meal we only spent 30 ,1
we didn t have a table booked but staff were happy to find us a table can get busy at weekends so recommend booking nice menu lots of variety we had some starters then had the bbq banquet to share you get your choice of meat brought to the table and you cook it to your preference on a bbq grill on your table meat was so fresh and tasty was served with lettuce leaves and rice to make a wrap staff so friendly and helpful food 10 10 we will definitely be back ,1
we were excited to find korean barbecue place in edinburgh it was super busy with no available tables on the moment we went but waiter kindly asked us to wait for 10 15 minutes finally we got our table and happily ordered beef bbq set for two unfortunately it doesn t come with lots of little additional dishes as in south korea does but one has to order for extra fee our bulgogi tasted well but it wasn t that authentic though for me the highlight was kimchi that tasted very different from packaged ones waiters were quick and polite thumbs up for them also it felt a bit expensive for what you get oh and bare in mind your clothes will be soaked with smelly smoke for days as everyone is grilling it s own meat and there are no smoke extractors unfortunately ,0
stumbled into this great place in juli amasing food great service and nice people a must visit the food was so good i forgot to drink my beer and i like beer,1
the korean bbq our 1st tasing of korean food it was amazing great theater of cooking your own meat on the bbq in your table well recommended and cheap as chips we were very surprised at the cost ,1
the food was awesome but pricey it was a bit annoying that kimchi was not part of the appetisers and that the appetisers weren t unlimited as a restaurant owned by a korean family i expected it to be like a proper korean restaurant in korea nevertheless the food was good enough and will be back for when i crave korean bbq again ,1
the food is very tasty with generous portions seafood noodles recommended staff is friendly and professional about 15 minutes walking from the royal mile ,1
other korean restaurants in edinburgh require reservations if you want to use the grill korean bbq was open for an impromptu visit and we were the only diners at 2pm in the afternoon we had the mixed meat platter for two and a couple of side dishes the food was tasty and fresh and the homemade kimchi was excellent we will definitely be going back and this time we ll bring the whole family and i ll be recommending korean bbq to everyone i know,1
nice places and good food we had the bbq with 5 different kinds of meat so we did most of the cooking ourselves as the meat was served raw and the table had a grill set into it vegetables rice and sauces completed the meal great fun and very social way of dining staff were young and maybe not too trained but all charming and helpful ,1
we had a party of 9 here and everyone really loved their food it s really unique to have a grill at your table which is easy and fun to use all starters bbq veg options were really tasty,1
this korean bbq restaurant has excellent food and attentive servers very busy so reservations might be a good idea ,1
very fanciful every table has a grill where everyone can cook the meat at will beyond that a great variety of soups and salads the staff is extremely kind and careful the food tasty and the prices pretty good ,1
this was an amazing reasturant if you are looking for good korean food i would highly recommend the staff and service were perfect food was marinated extremely well the grill on the bbq was replaced at the perfect timw to keep the food cooking the best it could accompanying sides were included with extras also available try it it speaks for it s self ,1
we enjoyed our dinner a great deal we thought the restaurant was very well priced and chose the beef b selection for 2 we also got an order of kim kimchi and hot beef soup to share we loved it all the beef selection came with three types and they gave us three sides lettuce sesame oil with salt and chili paste all were yummm i had to order white rice as it doesn t come with the order which from other places i ve been to globally that was weird my water glass came out with food on it which was gross but the server replaced it we asked for a pitcher of water but that never came when it came time to pay it was hard to get a server and the restaurant at this point was not full i would recommend the food and would go back for the food but the service could do a bit better green tea ice cream was yummm and on point to what we had in japan ,1
we are from the states so we have many korean bbq places to choose from we were a little nervous to try it but the other reviews were positive after a rough day of pulling suitcases up and down hills to get to our hotel we had a delicious meal at this place food tasted fresh staff was friendly and place was very clean the only down side to this place and why i gave 4 5 instead of 5 5 is because they only took cash on the day we went not sure if this is a usual thing but they at least knew where the closest atm machine was overall great place would definitely recommend it and would go back if we ever returned ,1
a nice atmosphere and good to see a korean bbq in edinburgh this concept has potential if the food improves food was edible and pleasant enough but i feel the chicken dish i ordered was miss sold by the waitress she warned me the dish i ordered was very spicy however it was actually tasteless and bland not a hint of flavour or spice in my opinion also the side dishes weren t very authentic and options to buy more sides were very limited e g the only noodle option is udon if you re looking for good korean in edinburgh i d recommend sodaeng as the best hope korean bbq is able to improve on authentic korean flavours as i liked the look and feel of this restaurant ,1
amazing food the whole bbq it yourself is great and a lot of fun when you visit with chatty friends had a great time staff is nice but the window is drafty def try not to sit at the window table during cold months doesn t spoil the food though d d,1
great service and generous bbq portions we will definitely come back to sample more of the menu the kim chi was delicious and the seafood is fresh ,1
book a table well in advance get e mail confirmation take train into edinburgh travel light with cash for a few beers card to pay for meal go see a festival show in george street and then 15 minute walk up to tarvit street table ready for us sit down handed menus all good so far just about to order and the wife spots the cash only sign at the till at the back of the restaurant we ask the waitress if it was indeed cash only and she says network was down only have card with me so we have to sheepishly leave the restaurant fair enough that the network was down a first for me but surely they could have emailed or phoned us to let us know as the festival was on everywhere was full so had to head back to the train station hungry shambles,0
never tried korean before so asked them to help me decide they were more than accommodating and went out of there way to say how the food is traditionally eaten can t ask for more than that it was fantastic give it a try you won t be disappointed ,1
tiny bit off the main thoroughfare and the frontage i think conceals a bit that the interior is really quite nice but not to be missed korean bbq is great because there s nothing like cooking the meat yourself then popping it in your mouth while it s still toasty hot vegetables also cook nicely too staff were charming and very attentive nice touch that the chef popped out to check on everyone really surprised at the bill given how much meat we ate we didn t drink much but it still felt good value we had the assorted meats bbq and it was all great marinaded strips of beef were particularly nice will look forward to bulgolgi and bibimbap next time other korean specialties we couldn t eat everything and they suggested themselves that we just cook up the rest and take it home i often wish i could do that at restaurants but i m too embarrassed to ask ,0
went here the other night for dinner luckily we booked a table before as its a busy and small place the starters were phenomenal and we ordered two of the bbq meats to share along with the veggies the food was amazing its a normal korean bbq where you cook your own meat at the table but the staff gave great tips on the best way to do it great sauces and side dishes to go with the meat as well the staff was very helpful and so friendly would go back every week if i lived in edinburgh ,1
enjoyed our first korean barbecue experience in this good value restaurant it was quiet on a tuesday night with only a couple of other tables occupied found the menu a bit confusing as a first timer and should have chosen more salads veg to go with the huge plate of meat we ordered to cook at the table but the staff were reasonably attentive refilling our glasses and swapping out the cooking plates regularly a fun experience in a cosy local restaurant ,1
great bbq here for a fair price and plenty of it it s a nice break from the typical pub food highly recommended ,1
i absolutely love korean bbq in edinburgh staff are wonderful so friendly and attentive and cannot do enough for you food is amazing and the prices are fantastic excellent value for money and a wonderful evening again ,1
went here with some friends 5 of us and we were really impressed staff were friendly and talked us through it all made recommendations and checked up on us regularly food was delicious super fresh meat and seafood would definitely recommend ,1
came here with my friend the novelty of the grill at the table was a big factor the staff were really friendly and helpful when we were looking to order we went for a big plate of different meats and it was really nice the pork was amazing it is quite expensive but it feels worth it ,1
visited with some friends recently after we d all come back from working in south korea and were missing the food stepping inside and first getting that aroma we felt instantly back in busan first off the staff were incredibly friendly and took loads of time to speak to us and were always on hand with anything we needed even showing the correct way to make a so maek the food was outstanding and i honestly don t think you ll find a better representation of the bbq atmosphere of korean restaurants in scotland or even the rest of the uk for that matter we had the assorted meat platter with some soup and it was plenty for 4 we also got some kimchi and again it s much better than you can buy in the shops no korean night out would be complete without some hite and some soju and thankfully they have both o all in all we had a great night there due to a combination of fantastically attentive staff and delicious food all in a great relaxed atmosphere i can t wait to go back it s my new favourite restaurant ,1
being a vegetarian i was a bit sceptical about going to this place and along with this i had never been to a korean restaurant before as soon as you enter it smells so so good unfortunately very few vegetarian options and the 2 courses that i ordered were very ok for the price they were at a special mention to the staff they were so good great service made us feel so comfortable and were always keeping a check in case we weren t sure about the bbq the chef had also come out once to check the bbq my friend loved the food but my food was ok and hence the 3 stars wish i could give more ,1
great variety of korean food in general and reasonable prices considering the quality a new exciting way of discovering a totally different dish in a cozy little restaurant lovely personnel smiling and always ready to give advice help and make your experience as fantastic as possible would definitely recommend ,1
had an excellent bbq here the place is spacious and clean it had a good buzzing atmosphere and service was excellent which makes such a difference staff were friendly helpful explaining how the bbq worked and they all looked like they wanted to be there bbq was excellent and very reasonably priced you can get just pork or beef or a mixed one we got the mixture of pork beef chicken and came with 2 beers for 38 the experience and the meat itself was fantastic especially the sauces and the pickled vegetables the marinated chicken and beef bulgogi were devine if you re on the atkins diet no danger here as the meats and vegetables are plentiful with no carbs in sight would highly recommend,1
we went here for lunch just a few minutes after it opened at 12 so we were the first in friendly welcome quick service tasty korean food worth a visit ,1
like some other comments i experienced a korean bbq whilst in tokyo many many years ago and have wanted to experience it again but have been unable to find one in scotland i then found the korean bbq on the tripadvisor website and immediately visited i ordered a mixed meat set meal the waiter suggested that this was a 3 person serving but since there were 2 of us they would pack the remainder for take away the mixed meat plater is accompanied by an array of side dishes from salad leaves to chilli paste the platter itself held many differently marinaded cuts of meat chicken pork and beef all raw for you to cook yourself on the bbq grill situated in the centre of the table the meats were delicious and as we did not finish the waiter packed up the remaining uneaten cook meats we accompanies the meal with korean beer which was the perfect match for the uninitiated this as a really fun way to dine and something everone should try it can get busy at the usual eating times so booking is advised we ate after the lunchtime rush so was easy to get a table i ve already made a reservation for next saturday and looking forward to it one last interesting point the bbq meal consists of meats and veg so a carb free option making it both delicious and healthy a seafood option is available also check it out you will love it ,1
the staff greeted us warmly checking if we eaten at the restaurant and or korean food before no and yes they asked if we needed help with the menu and also brought out complimentary sides which are also refilled for free which is a wonderful idea not just because they re complimentary but because they tasted divine it was my mum s first time eating korean food and now recognises there was no need for apprehension every morsal was heavenly our only disappointment was it was a light pre theatre dinner and we wanted to try more 1st rate kimchi salads are so flavoursome the hot pot was amazing and katsu curry spot on i can t wait to come back for a full on bbq feast and try lots more and its such an important note the staff were friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there which is so refreshing a real gem of a restaurant,1
my son and i visited after his ortho appointment for a lunch treat i m on a low carb diet just now and have to be a picky eater korean bbq was perfect as they brought suitable nibbles then i had a pork belly kim chi soup with a side of rice we took away which was satisfyingly spicy and delicious my son had chicken katsu his favourite and rice and said it was really good service was lovely small business chef owner and great decor very reasonable price this little place is tucked at the side of the king s theatre and so easy to miss but don t this food is perfect for pre theatre as it s not heavy and so less likely to induce that post supper soporific state so fatal in a darkened theatre space definitely returning to do the whole bbq thing ,1
we went there yesterday and we ordered a mixed meat set and a seafood pancake the quality of the meat is brilliant besides the waiter and waitress are very kind it was a nice experience strongly recommended ,1
we had an amazing meal there we went there in a group of 6 really polite and friendly service the food was delicious we got stuffed love the complimentary refills for the side dishes definitely will be back ,1
the staff were wonderful helping us to be comfortable with our first korean bbq experience the food was excellent fresh tasty and awesomely different really a great place ,1
wow thoroughly enjoyed the food we had a group of four and ordered quite a few dishes they graciously allowed us to add a table so we weren t too crowded i definitely recommend korean bbq if you re ever in edinburgh ,1
easily one of the top three korean bbq places i have eaten worldwide except korea if you are in edinburgh do your self a favor and stop in for an authentic delicious korean meal the owner was incredibly friendly and even gave up one of her tables to let our group spread out made a great evening,1
my friends and i had a great night of food and drink at korean bbq edinburgh staff are lovely and friendly and the service was great the prices were really good we thought it was one of the best value nights out we have had can t wait to return ,1
bbq d meats were delicious we had the squid and pork not rating this a 5 due to mediocre starters and lack of traditional banchan all the small plates that typically come with a korean meal we were also asked if we wanted rice which i found strange since that s expected with a traditional meal service was nice and expedient would still gladly return for the delicious flavor of the bbq ,1
we went there because we already knew about the korean barbeque and when we saw it walking around the area we thought to come and try it and it was an amazing success we ordered a seafood pancake chicken gyoja a kimchi side to try it since it is something typical from korea and the mo dum gu i assorted meat bbq selection everything was really good the seafood pancake was nothing special but it was nice and tasty more pancake flavour than seafood but it was nice overall the chicken gyoja were really nice the kimchi side is something you have to try at least once and it was something spicy crunchy fresh and with a lot of flavour even though is a side measure it is quite a nice portion so keep in mind if you just want to try it and the best for us was the mo dum gu we got the assorted meat bbq menu that includes salads it comes with 2 sauces one spicy and delicious and another of sesame that it was also really good also comes with lettuce to make wraps and when we ran out of lettuce they brought us more without charging for it it also comes with some salads to fill your wraps or eat them alone delicious spicy and tasty and the meat selection is top notch everything was really nice but our favourites were the pork neck slice and the darkgalbi both of them marinated it includes also 2 beers or 2 soft drinks but as we were ordering a bottle of wine pinot grigio veneto we didn t ordered them they brought to us some special radish to taste and include in the wraps for free it was really good and it fits perfectly with the pork belly wraps since it was rather late and we were quite full we decided not to order any dessert but we will do for sure the next time the waitress and the waiter were friendly helpful and professional they didn t step in too much in our table and we didn t have to wait for anything they were really attentive and smiling since we had a lot of food with sauces and we were eating slow we got replaced our grills twice but it was made with the best of the attitude and they were not intrusive or disturbing at all the experience was amazing we will come back for sure and try other dishes and desserts as recommendation for the staff you could put a sign on the corner of the street to make more noticeable your place because you deserve all the possible attendance and success cheers natalia and aingeru ,1
our first experience of this style of cuisine and we enjoyed it bewildering range of choice including a lot of options to cook your own on a special hotplate built in to the tables as we had a limited time due to going to the theatre afterwards we opted for dishes prepared in the kitchen ,1
ate here last night for the second time in as many months and this time went for the barbecue at the table and loved the whole experience the food was gorgeous and the staff were helpful and pleasant can t recommend this place highly enough especially if you haven t eaten this way before ,1
loved the experience of the korean bbq loved the food and vibe staff were very helpful and bill was very reasonable top marks ,1
a friend recommended this restaurant and we enjoyed a lovely meal together i enjoyed the tasty food from an excellent choice of dishes but loved the intimate feel of this cosy restaurant we went early on opening 5pm and very soon after we could see how popular this place is with young couples we didn t have courage to bbq at table but what a lovely feature i had only experienced this in japan i have planned to return with more friends and look forward to my next meal ,1
something different from the usual uk style restaurants was an excellent visit meat was very delicious my compliments to the chef me sauces for dipping were tasty prices were reasonable would visit again side note while the restaurant is wheelchair accessible the toilets are not ,1
i have lived in south korea previously and find this to be the best barbecue restaurant in edinburgh there is a good choice everything is really tasty and it s good value for money especially the set meals will definitely be back ,1
we had a mixed bbq and it tasted amazing and was reasonably priced considering how much meat you got and it included 2 beers service was also very fast and both the waitresses were very nice and were just the right amount of attentive couldn t recommend you try this place enough ,1
i am from korea south and i know the real taste of korean dishes found this restaurant randomly and wanted to give it a go i have noticed that most of korean meals that you can try overseas can be a little bit different from its original taste i have tried a few korean restaurants in edinburgh and this place is actually good ordered three dishes and all of them are really tasty we two of us cleared all of them fine dishes loved it i gave 4 stars for two reasons 1 parking can be a nightmare 2 price is slightly higher than other restaurants am i going back for sure if you want to experience try this one or sodaeng which is another good one to recommend good luck ___ ,1
we came from london and we ll end up having korean bbq it s really good place food r yummy love bim bim bub and bbq we enjoy our meal i would recommend to everyone thank you for the good meal xxx,1
have been there recently went for a booked table the soju was amazing plum we chose vegetarian and full fat sharing dish and the spices were brilliant but all together i missed some more meat by taste there was nothing to complain about maybe rather the portion or the mixture of the meat veg definitely will go back cause i am curious about the grill what is built in the table in front of you,1
great food and great service was so much fun to bbq your own food at the table had a great selection on the menu never had korean food before but now a huge fan reasonably priced will definitely return again soon ,1
the restaurant is nice and cozy the food is delicious so far i liked everything that i have ordered the staff are very polite and helpfull,1
we had a very disappointing evening here i have to follow a gluten free diet and my friend stated in advance in her email booking that there would be two people who had to eat gluten free the menu online also says that dietary requirements should be made clear to the waiters when we were ordering we asked the waiter which of the dishes could be made gluten free and which dishes should be avoided the waiter did not know what gluten free meant and what wheat was when we tried to describe the dietary requirement he made some suggestions from the banquet menu but could not confirm whether any of the sauces in the dishes contained gluten ingredients which was very worrying we ended up having to order boiled rice and edamame means as we could not take the risk of having an allergic reaction i would advise anyone with any dietary issues to avoid this restaurant as nobody seemed to follow through on the claim that they could accommodate dietary requirements ,1
real korean food and from start to end great experience love it absolutely 5 star for 30 pounds we had loads of food and a great experience ,1
it is so refreshing to do some grilling again this is a good place for friends to sit down chill and cook out the place is average decor does not add a feel of being in an asian food place service is ok they do help other customers who are new to table top grill experience the food is satisfying especially since it s been a long time since we ve had some grilled meat on the table but i would say i ve had better in the past also there were only three side dishes in authentic korean restaurants they provide about 5 or more with unlimited refills nevertheless if you miss the experience this place provides some semblance to korean grills in the uk,1
this place is hard to discover by chance but if you re lucky enough to walk past it you shouldn t hesitate to come in we had quite a classic selection of pork belly and chilli marinated pork both delicious and on the side we tried a kimchi pancake the meal comes with traditional vegetable sides appetizers too which make you feel like you re really splurging on yourself even when your meal isn t that expensive we ll definitely be back ,1
enjoyed the bbq platter and most delightful seafood pancake for starter but staff rushed to take the starter away meat was excellent had to ask for extra lettuce and spring onion to eat it all and was charged extra for it which i thought was unnecessary considering the cost no atmosphere in the restaurant so not rushing back ,0
i visited this new restaurant with my korean born family for a celebration after a recommendation i was so pleased i chose here because everyone was very impressed with the food and the atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing the interior has a contemporary design feel we went for the barbecue at your table option and cooked the meat ourselves which was good fun and made for an inclusive experience as we fought for control of the tongs and argued over who was to be chef we had the sam gyup sal 3 layered pork doe ji bulgogi marinated pork so bulgogi marinated beef saeng galbi beef ribs and doenjang jjigae traditional stew it was all excellent particularly the meat i cooked ㅎㅎ i would particularly recommend the sam gyup sal which was a really flavoursome piece of meat service was efficient and friendly and for me the bill was very reasonable i am looking forward to visiting again and trying some different dishes ,1
been there twice since they ve opened and yes the food is good i d give it 4 stars points off because my kimchi soup was a bit bland but it was so frustrating how the dished appeared with long delays for different people the first time it was just two of us and it was relatively busy so we thought it s not the end of the world that my boy friend had already finished his meal before mine appeared also he hadn t noticed that he had to order rice with his meal and this also wasn t pointed out by the waiter by the time we noticed this the waiter was nowhere to be seen so basically my bf ate his main course with some delay also his rice portion and then finally did my course appear the same thing happened again the next time we came we were 4 people then and there was only one other couple in the restaurant but there was a 10min lag between everyone s course being brought to the table very frustrating the fact that the waiter said enjoy your meal to the first person who got his food and then walked away kind of implied that he d better eat before it gets cold i guess it was generally very hard to get the waiter s attention he even disappeared to the outside and never looked if we wanted more food drinks etc by the end of the meal we were sat for 30minutes chatting but nobody came to actually remove the dirty plates and dishes from us i really hope that this place gets its service sorted because it could be really good if it does ,1
excellent new addition in tollcross have ordered a take away twice now and enjoyed the food both times please give it a try if you are in the area ,1
i m korean and i came to scotland for a holiday this is easily the best korean japanese restaurant in edinburgh because they make real authentic korean dishes made me feel like i was home in korea hehe,1
it is our first time for korean food in edinburgh i would say that i will absolutely come back again all food is fresh and good quality thanks for this lovely meal see you next time ,1
a small restaurant but the food is so good and i like the decoration here i like the bbq here especially the flavoured chicken and the starters kimchi is authentic too sushi and rolls i like the lion king roll are ideal options beside the beef bibimbap ,1
famous for its stir fried chicken in spicy sauce dak galbi this restaurant is always very packed whenever we visit lucky for us we are able to get a seat quickly this time we ordered the mix set which comes in 2 portion spicy and non spicy the spiciness of the spicy version is just right and the non spicy version is marinated in a sweet sauce both taste exceptionally good especially when mixed with the generous amount of cheese higly recommended and definitely a restaurant of a great value ,1
came here with my husband last spring and he loves the food it s a bit spicy but tolerable the food is cooked in front of you there is also unlimited side dishes price is affordable ,1
we visit this restaurant every time we re in myeongdong area for a buldak fix don t forget to order the cheese service could be better but understandle since its not a fine dining restaurant ,1
my first time trying yoogane was a lousy one staff was unfriendly and unapproachable they did not pay attention to our table and our food was left unattended until it got burnt ,0
terrible service rude waiter and waitress when we had difficulty understanding what a particular waiter was trying to tell us in korean he kept repeating the same thing in korean over and over again without making an attempt to seek help from his fellow colleague who could speak basic english we were exasperated even before the start of a meal we asked for the wifi password and the waitress replied no wifi in a mono tone and gave us an expressionless look very unfriendly to top it all the food was not fabulous our 1st and last time there ,0
ate here with my 10 yr old he doesn t like spicy food waitress recommended chicken bulgogi with rice and cheese ohhh it was really really good they have free veggie salad and barley tea price is very affordable highly recommended for families ,1
they prepare everything on a hot plate on the table but koreans are used to spicy food so you come out smelling like spicy bbq i am sure that the food is not bad but after a while everything you taste is spicy even the water the second time we asked for non spicy and they still made it spicy i think that everything is ready in the kitchen and they don t want to make special orders their self service water station has hot water but you have to boil it yourself ,1
ate at this restaurant with my daughter the kimchi rice was delicious but of course very filling and way too much for only two people there are many to choose from and the ingredients are cooked right in front of you make sure you come with a big appetite a must try when in seapul of craving for kimchi roce the place was packer and there a hige line prices are average ,1
we walked past this restaurant and were intrigued to see what the hype was because the restaurant was full we had to share the set meal so if you came with someone and you didn t want to eat the food there you are screwed so we had a set dinner for 4 people and chose the recommended dish with the kilo of cheese i have to say it s very different it was nice but very rich i was stuffed the food was ok ,1
who can resist for mozarella this restaurant is very famous if you go to korea you must it the chicken dakgalbi with mozarella you can add ramen and topokki also you can add fried rice and mix with the leftover then you get fried rice taste really good and worth the price ,1
it was a good experience to try chicken galbi here it was a bit spicy but it was good and at the end rice was added and cooked with the leftover galbi so it turned out to be tasty fried rice ,1
we tried the chicken and seafood dish for 2 and it was better than expected however very spicy we enjoyed the style which was very interesting for us they bring you the order uncooked then it get cooked infront of you on your table was also faster to cook than expected ,1
there are now a number of outlets of yoogane in myeongdong area but we decided to visit this one instead finding it to be more spacious with more tables staff speaks simple english and is very friendly and helpful we ordered 1 non spicy for the kids and 1 spicy for adults the non spicy portion turned out to be a little salty but the kids loved it the spicy portion was great and not too hot for asian level of hotness we concluded that the spicy one was better compared to the non spicy one we found out that the side bar only after the meal since the staff didn t explain it to us during order overall we had a pleasant experience with the service and food offered ,1
we had the mixed seafood and chicken kalbi and my kids really liked the food we were 5 in the group and ordered some extra rice and mozarella cheese it was super yummy and we were all satisfied will definitely recommend the place thumbs up ,1
very cheap with large portions and unlimited sides service was really good and i highly recommend going ,1
chicken is grilled on a built in hotplate at the table with some cabbage and ramen optional and finally cheese comfort food on a winter day free flow kimchi is available self service restaurant is smoky during the grilling wear an apron to prevent stain on clothing i covered my handbag coat with the apron to prevent smokiness ,1
the burner is built into each table and the server puts a pan on the hot plate and then stir fries the spicy chicken vegetables and rice to create the dak galbi which is the signature dish i just sat back and enjoyed my beer while watching my food being prepared right in front of me the servers are moving quickly from table to table so it s rather impersonal service but i enjoyed it very much ,1
not recommended for bug families as you will be forced to order the same item since there is only 1 hot plate per table of 4 you have choice to add side items meat is sufficiently marinated and tasted good interesting to see how the server prepared the food what is good is you can help yourself to the salad and preserved radish surprising there was no kimchi costs per person average about 7000won,0
food is cooked in front of you at your table in a big pot served with condiments nice experience and atmosphere ,1
highly recommend here about 10 per person great way to bbq meat and vegetables and rice at the table really enjoyed the experience,1
there was little service provided at this branch the staff were just standing around and gossiping with each other we had to take a few moments to even get someone to take our orders we ordered a seafood pancake which came undercooked it was still soggy with the pancake mix pretty sure a pancake was not meant to be wet unless we are missing something here maybe this is the way they make their pancakes ,1
we enjoyed a pan of chicken and octopus galbi for us to share there were sides you can eat and they re readily available at the corner of the restaurant we enjoyed our meal with beer and the night was awesome i m coming back to this place ,1
value for money and service was really good plentiful of side dishes and the galbi was very well marinated ,1
waitress very unfriendly in taking order due to communication barrier she did not understand my question and as i repeated she walks away then she came back to raise her voice people are very unfriendly and not recommended at all ,0
it was recommended by locals as one of the best it was good but still below our expectations the spicey source was good for a chicken but it killed the vegetables and mushrooms taste ,1
always part of our itinerary whenever in kr tip always get additional cheese for a truly unforgettable experience,1
i think they have 2 stores in myeongdong we went to the one on the 1st floor above lala mart went there twice during our trip 1st last night as we love the dakgalbi and personally i love the teppan fried rice must add cheese they will come around to help with the meat tossing occasionally or you can cook it by yourself free flow of sides like kimchi other pickles would recommend to try if in myeongdong area yumsssssssssssss,1
satisfying meal good enough for everyone we ordered the basic set chicken barbecue with fried rice for four extra cheese and extra noodle for my wife who doesn t want it that spicy we were attended to immediately and the staff were going around to see to it that they would cook the food in front of you every time they would pass your table until it is done and ready to eat i found the taste very nice and it does go well with their korean cider which actually is their local sprite dinner turned out fine even if i did have some hesitation before we entered the place ,1
best to go to this place with a localite as it will help with the ordering they have a live stove in the middle of the table to help cook keep the food hot it is a very crowded happening place and the food is tasty ,1
the servers in this resto are very rude we decided to leave the restaurant instead of looking at their crappy faces and rude attitude whats so good about this resto that servers are allowed to provide an attitude to its customers do not eat here there are alot of dak galbi around the area that far better than others ,0
experienced very bad service there hardly anyone came to fry the hot plate and side dishes is the not so popular choices like radish and white cabbage no kimchi at all for that price we can have 2 big hotpot of gamjatang and heavy bbq option ,0
overall satisfaction experience marinated chicken and octopus stir fried with cabbage green onions easy to order and just add on noodles cheese or rice the meal will be cooked at your table where you can enjoy the sizzling sound see that fancy red and finally enjoy the full taste but the only restrictions is meal must be ordered in the exact number of people s portion so,1
this place is fking crap the staff here is ridiculous when first arriving the cashier at the front failed to acknowledge us we then had to sit ourselves down and nobody even came to serve us for an entire 15 minutes when staff finally came to us after 15 minutes they provided us with a menu and only 10 seconds later asked what we wanted when we asked for a minute to decide the waitress rolled her eyes and sighed heavily later a foreign family of four ladies came and experienced the same treatment their response was to leave the restaurant which i now wished we did the food here was mediocre at best and our only wish was to get up and leave as soon as possible do yourself a favor and do not enter this establishment if you like rude customer service then this place is perfect for you ,1
simply delicious and reasonably priced we had a set with both the spicy and honey seasoned chicken with noodles and its good will definitely go again when i m in seoul ,1
me and my friends only tried the chicken fried rice but it was so good in fact it was so good that we came back 5 times for more on our trip to korea last time we ate there we asked less spice and that was a mistake since the spiciness really added to the taste of the food once one of the employee finished frying the rice he shaped it as a heart was super cute was very cheap too so it didn t kill our wallet ,1
first of all we didn t even get to eat at their restaurant thank god i came in to their restaurant during lunch and ask this person at the casher if they can cater for 16 people and he said no then i ask if he can prepare a table for 4 since my son is craving for fried ramen what happen next was he went straight to the door and ask me to leave then i ask him nicely how long do i have to wait he said go and don t wait with a rude voice witout looking at my face and there was no explanation even a simple appology this restaurant is the worst i have ever encounter in terms of their service with their customer the rudest restaurant in seoul i don t recommend anyone to come to this place it will definitely spoiled your trip ,1
came in as 15pax and asked if they could accommodate said no and we ask if we could get separate tables by seating separately one of the staff was very rude and started asking us to leave stating that they don t want to serve us food is mediocre just like any order ordinary dakgalbi nothing great would not recommend anyone here due to the terrible service ,0
a bad idea to take your family to eat at this place i went into this restaurant with 3 members of my family the staff treated us very badly we ordered 4 different servings of food but they forced us to order the same menu price is not a problem for us even though this restaurant has an average price of over 14 000 won but the appetite is something that is very privacy for us the stupidest decision i made when traveling to south korea was to go to this restaurant this is serious don t be tempted by the crowds of people you see from outside the restaurant stay away from this restaurant from your visit to the itinery ,0
my wife and i were at this restaurant around 3 in the afternoon was seated by staff waving in a general direction so we found some seats and sat down to look at the menu after being over looked for close to 20 minutes even as we watched 3 other tables that arrived after us get served we decided to leave we never got to eat but the sense we had was that we were being ignored on purpose because waiters were serving the tables immediately around us so for service and attitude i strongly recommend people to not eat here there are too many good restaurants around that deserve our business before this one ,0
this is the first time i patronise this restaurant and what i liked was when they cooked the ramen inside the wok which reminded me of my favourite mee goreng back home we had half the wok with spicy and the other half with marinated chicken separated by cheese right in the middle ,1
reservation man reject us because we have kids what terrible services we angry and he keep reject us he said no food for kids find another restaurant ,0
this place serves the best fried rice ever don t be fooled by the menu just get the 2nd best at 6500won per head min 4 plus 4 servings mozzarella cheese you will thank me for this ,1
this was one of the highly recommended food in many blog but after trying various other types of korean food this one pale compared in terms of authenticity and taste to me if you run out of ideals and this is near by can consider for eat to live what i didn t like about such restaurant is that you have to order the same kind of food for 2 persons because they cannot fry different meal flavor on the same hot top ,1
the meal in this place is good and the salad is great but this outlet in myengdong is terrible how so we came and the staff told us to choose seat so we choose seat in table for 4 person that comfy in the right side from entrance and sit there and suddenly come other staff that look like it is the manager and he yell to us that we cannot sit there because there is 2 stove in the table and move as rudely to table that have one stove in the back and it is continue when we want to choose the menu that staff tell we must have same menu because the stove is just one and menu cannot be mixed eventhough we wanted to have different menu and we forbidden to move back to that table so we comprise and got same menu because we already hungry later on when we paid the bill that rude staff is in the cashier and give the change without saying anything the other staff is still friendly and said thank you but look like afraid of that person i will never come this place again and recommended you to choose other branch in the end of this street if you want tasted this good food ,1
the food is okay but the owner is rude and disrespectful the three of us came to that place the staff allow me to choose the table and we choose the table with 4 desk near the wall then the owner came and yell no no three persons here here no no no he told us to move to the table at the back near kitchen after we paid the owner not even say a single word and thank you the other sajangnim we met in korea always say thank you and polite except this owner i will never come to this place again,0
we had brunch in this restaurant we were 7 so we were broken into 2 tables the waiter informed us that those seated in 1 table were required to have the same order so 4 of us wanted spicy food so they sat together and had to order 4 servings of the spicy chicken rice the other 3 who were not into spicy food had to order 3 servings of the chicken bulgogi which was sweet but also slightly spicy and separate orders of rice i really enjoyed the chicken bulgogi and even the people in the spicy table liked it the rice was sticky and delicious too after eating we had to go to the cashier at the entrance and pay the bill ,1
when i want to eat spicy stir fried chicken i usually went yoogane yoogane has many kinds of menu and we can choose that we want to eat when i went to yoogane i almost eat yoogane s spicy stir fried chicken it was my best menu in yoogane sometimes i add noodles and cheese i think cheese is the best combination with spicy stir fried chicken lastly when i am done eating we can add fried rice i think this steps are best step for eating spicy stir fried chicken therefore if you have some chance for try it you can order this menu in addition price is not really expensive ,1
will come here whenever i visit seoul the chicken is well marinated combined with noodles made a wonderful dish,1
me and my friend went to yoogane in myeongdong we ordered dakgalbi with additional ramen and cheese the staff can speak english very well so there is no problem for tourist if we cant speak korean they provide free water so we dont need to order drink the best dakgalbi so far will come back again when i visit seoul ,1
i guess i am not the only one experience the bad customer service came here during lunch time but not peak hour yet we wanted to order one set of the chicken galbi but the staff is so rude saying i said this is for one person portion i asked politely whether we can share just in case it was too spicy for us he repeat i said more loudly his face turn so sour walk away we have no choice but to order 2 person portion 6500 won times 2 turns out so spicy made our stomach discomfort couldn t even finish 1 4 portion of it chicken meat is so little in the set i would suggest to skip this rude arrogant restaurant ,1
i am not really a typical customer who will write a bad comment i was really excited to eat here because this is my first time and i came with my friend but i am very very disappointed with yoogane chicken in myeongdong services especially staff name chang dong na services she has the bob cut hair first staff came to our table asking for the order she is not very nice from the beginning but i still think maybe she s busy and in a rush after we order she s just take the food in the table and leave considering me and my friend are first timer eating here we don t know how to cook the food and she just leave without saying a word we assume that we have to cook the food by ourself and after we trying to put all the food together and cook she s just running into our table and say it in korean language with rude tone voice and she throwing out the food from the cooking pan with very very unappropriate way and she just start talking to the other staff luckily my friend a lil bit korean language and she just tell me what she said in korea if i was them i will not eat the food i probably not recommended this restaurant please treat the customer nicely even when you are busy just do the job proffesionally ,1
had yoongane twice during our visit to korea just 3 days and the food was great excellent experience tasty food big portions and very cheap service is good staff really helped us to cook the food i think english maybe the factor people think they are rude but they re not ,1
i don t normally write reviews but this restaurant was so bad that i was compelled to write one this was our first meal in korea and didnt know what we re in for staff pointed to our table we were given menus we called the waiter to order when she arrived she was too busy fixing her makeup and hair on the mirror wall just wasn t interested asked her if the food was spicy we were eating with young kids she said no when food came it was spicy she just gave us a disgusted look went away happily spoke to other staff came back again with another disgusted look the supposedly personally chef was meant to cook our food we waiting too long and started to cook our own food couldnt understand why we were treated in this manner we were a family of 4 2 adults and 2 kids spoke nicely to them tried other restaurants for the next 7days food was better and services at other places was outstanding later on i realised a lot of other people that came here were treated the same way believe it its true don t waste your money here pros ok food cons worst restaurant staff i have came across in my last 10 years of travel ,0
yoogane is located in the heart of myeongdong price is standard in seoul and portion is for 2 4 persons the specialty of this restaurant is dakgalbi which is chicken and cooked with rice our children liked it so much side dish is also simple with kimchi as main side dish ,1
the food is good but the service was bad probably i was speaking in chinese with my kids and the waitress gave a face and when a japanese family walked in the waitress was giving the best smile n greeting the other family this made me wonder why there is a diff in service hence i will not be eating in such restaurant again ,0
i came to seoul without knowing about k pop k drama or even korean food we didn t quite have the motivation to try out restaurants since me and my friend doen t really enjoy korean food but this restaurant changed our opinion the spice doesn t feel tasteless like the other dakgalbi i tasted in my country we finished the whole wok just the 2 of us ,1
we tried the chicken galbi and it was really an excellent experience basically they get raw marinated chicken with optional veggies bulgogi or seafood and cook it on a large pan on your table everyone on the table needs to have the same dish as its communal eating and they bill you per head ,1
the restaurant provides the food with direct cooking on the table in front of the guests which is quite interesting to watch the taste is good and the portion is so big we ordered only 2 portion for 3 persons yet we felt so full ,1
 single diners are promptly turned away if you show up with at least one other person you might get a table ,0
wanted some spicy korean dakgalbi while hanging out in myeongdong and all everything seems to be pointing towards yoogane pressto this shop has very delicious and spicy chicken and octopus galbi super texture and wrap it up with side dish of fried rice which soaks up all the goodness from the galbi the shop has rotating team that comes every 3 mins to stir fry your plate which means you get 3 4 different person frying your galbi get your own unlimited kimchi and salad bar at the corner and the kimchi is good went there again as was hooked to the galbi ,1
we had yoongane twice during our visit once for lunch and another time for dinner tried the spicy chicken with cheese the first time it was really delicious but we found it a little too spicy after the cheese ran out the second time we had the honey chicken which tasted great only downside was that we could not order any extra sides after a certain timing so we couldn t add any ramen or stuff but we were thankful that they were still open as most of then restaurants were already closed they are open till 1am ,1
this is a great place to have dakgalbi a spicy chicken and rice stir fry this dish is a must have for seoul south korean tourists usually this dish is very spicy but thankfully this place is used to tourists so they don t make it as spicy here the decor here is pretty nice and clean more like a modern western restaurant standard feel the tables have a kind of stove and when we ordered the dish they brought a massive pot they cooked the meat and rice for you though you can do some of it yourself that s one of the beauties of eating like this the active participation and freshness of the food you get to eat this dish is really tasty there s vegetables as well and it is saucy with a spicy sweet and savoury flavour it s difficult to a solo diner here because the portion is massive and i don t know if they have to go it was about 20 000 won the price is moderate compared to other cheaper places but still reasonable and delicious the service is very fast and efficient i would definitely go here to have this dish again ,1
there are many of these chain restaurants in seoul the establishment is always busy because it has a fast service with reliable taste and affordable price if you want to get traditional chicken galbi 유가네 닭갈비 in a local small friendly place with tasty side dishes and wanting to blend in to the local crowd you would love this place if you higher expectations there are better places that serve the same food for a higher price i would recommend it ,1
the food is ok for korean standard the place is nice and accommodating atmosphere is cheerful and waiters know a little english which helps alot serving size is ok we are 4 people and ordered 3 serving and it was enough for us ,1
this restaurant is always busy whenever we pass by we went to myeongdong 3 consecutive days and we were amazed how they get lots of customers the first time we tried around 11pm we were told that they were closed already so we went back the ff day for lunch had a good chicken and seafood dish with cheese though they can still improve on their side dishes wait staff always check our food and they did it alternately very often ,1
went in this place after saw lot of people in there staff don t have patient to answer our question and been rude i know they re busy but this is not the way to handle foreign customer some dishes cannot be share if you have more people in my case 5 person and forced us to pick some dishes that charged us per pax staff only came once in a while to stir the raw meat and we had to do it our own before they came to our table ,0
there were 10 small tables free and they refused to attend me apparently because i was alone and kick me out if a korean would go there alone will receive the same treatment ,0
one of a must eat place in seoul korean loves chicken and cheese put it together and you would get spicy chicken fried rice with added mozzarella cheese the food is cooked right in front of you and for you and it is very tasty the spiciness is just right and it is a delicious meal that can be shared by the table pro tip the minimum order is two people portion and they open till 2am perfect for a mid night snack ,1
highly recommended for first timers in myeongdong before you jump in your night shopping exercises make sure to load some calories at this resto there s six of us and we ordered different dishes from their menu my everything we ordered is worth every won we paid side dishes are refillable too serving sizes are for sharing so if you re in a group you can budget between krw10 000 15 000 each for a hearty meal ,1
our first dakgalbi and we were not disappointed it had the right amount of spice and the marinated chicken and octopus were yummy we ordered fried rice and it was added in together with the chicken and octopus would have loved to add the cheese but i think it would have been too filling best to eat with more people i went with my 71 year old mom so we wanted to order just for one to share but that wasn t allowed in the end we almost managed to finish our food you could get as much from the salad bar if you can t tolerate spice you might not enjoy this be warned though after your food your hair and clothes will smell of bbq ,1
i m not really sure if this is the 1st store there s a few yoogane in myeongdong but this store is rather big we have 2 persons and ordered marinated chicken galbi assorted seafood with 1 fried rice should have ordered 2 fried rice at first we don t know how to ordered we were lucky that the young girl who served us could speak english and also she recommended us to take this marinated chicken galbi assorted seafood because this serve 2 3 pax other sets serve 1 pax and we have to order 2 servings the portion was not very huge we can finished them the marinated chicken was quite tasty not greasy and very flavorful the staff look busy those who cannot communicate with us simply ignore us when we call for them ,1
i saw the restaurant had a big one step to get in but inside it was pretty accessible i was pushing my husband s wheelchair in when the greeter didn t let us in at all he said we could not go in because it was too narrow i went inside and i could see there was plenty of room to move around compared to most of the restaurants around myeongdong he said sorry but didn t let us in even tough there was room ,0
not sure if this is the correct branch as there are many branches in myeondong anyway the food served are the same highly recommend tourists to have this in south korea as it is really very cheap my friend and i ordered a 2 pax portion for our dinner when it came we were shock as it was huge the staff were very attentive and keep coming over to help us fry the chicken and making sure it s cooked before removing the metal ring fenced around the hotpot and shutting down the flame it was very spicy but very yummy the cheapest meal we had in south korea for our whole trip the meal only cost us around usd11 super worth it so its a must eat in south korea as the same portion cost about usd20 30 back in our home country ,1
we tried chicken galbi with cheese for 3 person fried rice for 2 person the cheeseeee is soooo overflowing even we can eat the cheese for snack haha love the place staff really help us to cook the food and tell us where should get the side dish ,1
did spend my first dinner at yoogane my friend and i loved the food so much the service the taste the affordable price we bought duo package for 21 000 won and get plenty of chickens with two sauce located in the lovely myeongdong i will come back here again for sure very recommended ,1
chicken galbi with mozzarella cheese is great staff can t speak much english and that maybe a factor people think they are rude but they re not they try their best good food but really spicy it s around 12 per person which is well worth it ,1
we got to our hotel late and wanted to try some street food on the way to dinner and yoogane was on our restaurant list it s a casual restaurant with lots of young local customers there were 3 of us and we wanted to try multiple galbi options he suggested just one order for 2 as it was a lot of food and should be able to serve 3 adults we didn t listen but at least he tried to stop us we ordered the spicy galbi with cheese for 2 the meat dipped and curled around the melted cheese was divine we next ordered the mixed honey and marinated galbi with a cheese river separating the two meats again very good you may need to double check that the meat is cooked through as a few pieces needed to be cooked a bit longer it wasn t a problem as you just moved it to the side to cook longer they have a little self service bar where you can pick up your own kimchee soybean soup the 3 of us nearly finished the 2 complete orders if we had more time we would have gone back for another meal ,1
my friend and i loved yoogane we were the only non koreans in the restaurant when we dined in but have no worries the staff dealt with us well even though they all said their english wasn t very good the menu is in korean and english and pointing works well too be warned that portions are large so come hungry and make sure you take advantage of the side bar to get your kimchi fix in for free ,1
staff are so rude they shouted at us and insisted to order one per person even though we have 2 kids with us we weren t able to finish our food food is not good at all i don t recommend this place ,0
the cheese is pretty good it is one of the best korean food i have ever tried after your stomach is full you can start your shopping journey there ,1
frankly i have not experienced shops can beat this in terms of service shopkeeper insisted we had to order one portion per person even though we told them we definitely could not finish and it would be a waste of food walked out as the attitude of the waiter was so bad that we rather go somewhere else that shows even a tiny bit of respect to food ,1
yoogane for chicken galbi and we weren t disappointed as we were staying in myeongdong this was an easy choice for dinner only downside was we wished they gave us more meat ,1
two adults and two kids kids were not hungry so we wanted to just order food for 2 adults but server said no 4 seats you must order minimum 3 orders what a shame we walked out there are many other restaurants with a same menu nearby terrible attitude ,0
firstly the staff was very gracious and accommodating they helped us with the menu because we weren t aware of the level of spiciness there was a salad bar where you can get the vegetables and kimchi the meat is as tender and as well marinated the level of spiciness is less than moderate and it is more sweet than spicy actually it was complemented by the vegetables and kimchi the chicken may be the main dish but we also tried the seafood which was equally amazing and tasty overall i enjoyed yoogane because of it s value for money great dining experience and the food of course we came back regularly during our stay in korea ,1
after shopping and walking around myeongdong you must visit this restaurant located in myeongdong to feed your belly you can choose chicken beef or seafood for the main dish and you can also can choose rice or noodle if you wanna for addition you can choose vegetable cheese and another topping to mix it together the boy from this restaurant will help you too cook with the pan located in you table their cooking skill will be a good show that you must see it ,1
i ve eaten there once we ordered for 2 people but it was really too much for 2 people we were so full delicious food nice place average price ,1
the name yoogane is very famous for dakgalbi other branches in myeongdong are are ok but this branch is terrible the staffs who are taking care of the queue are not quite friendly when we got the seats and started to order they were not polite at all we would like to order for the quantity that we could finish we also had a small child with us but they did not allow us to do so they did not care that we had a small kid more over we came in 5 people but they separated one of us to sit with the strangers in the table beside the rest 4 so no more for this branch ,1
we had yoogane chicken galbi at a different branch the night before like it so much that we decided on lunch at a separate branch this shop is much bigger easier to find but service and food are not as good as previous night s while browsing the menu the waiter refused to take our order for beers we chosen yoogane marinated chicken galbi today but the cooking was too fast and the vegetables are very much half cooked this is one branch of yoogane that i will avoid ,0
we ordered seafood fried rice with rice cakes the taste was a bit bland maybe its because we malaysians like flavourfull food i dont know you have to get the sides which is the kimchi and the cabbage salad by your own at the counter the waiter was okay not friendly but not rude either ,0
we came for dinner on new year s eve around 6 pm easily found a table we ordered 2 of the chicken fried rice i didn t want anything spicy and this wasn t each person has to order 1 order so we ordered 2 orders of this for 6 000 won each someone cooks the food for you and you can get some pickles kimchi and salad yourself the staff isn t overly friendly but for the price we didn t expect too much food was hot and good it s more like korean fast food ,1
we went to the restaurant during busy hour the waiter who served us was pretty rude and there were many limitations on what we can order which is ridiculous this problem is made worse as the food we ate was less than stellar i strongly urge readers to avoid going here as you would probably have a bad experience like us ,0
our nami tour started and ended at myeondong we went there early to make sure we make on time during our ocular at myeondong we saw this galbi restaurant called yoogane so after the tour we headed to this galbi place it was not surprising that their galbi was really good because the restaurant was full we ordered half half galbi meaning half classic and half spicy chicken galbi their side dishes are self service ,1
on my entry i was asked how many people when i replied that i was dining alone without explanation the male bespectacled waiter pointed to the door and shouted out i demanded the reason and eventually i was told that lone diners were not welcome a lovely american couple offered to share their table i thanked them but decided that i could not stay in this place 1 minute longer i went to a nearby restaurant had a lovely meal and was treated with politeness and respect,1
we when there to dine as we thought it was a halal friendly diners checked out the place to our surprise the place is not halal they don t serve pork but then their chickens are non halal the service was also bad no one guide us to our table when we approached the counter we sat there for almost 15 min before someone approached us asked us the order we asked the waiter whether the place is a halal friendly they said no so we left the place immediately so my advise to all our muslim colleagues stay away from the restaurant ,0
my parents fiance and myself had been looking forward to dine at this restaurant we headed there a little later in the afternoon to miss the lunch crowd when we got there there was no queue and a bunch of tables available great the ladies headed over to the restroom but there was a queue my dad and myself had a seat and looked through the menu we decided on what we wanted to eat and my mum got back and started looking through the menu here is when our mood was totally killed my lady wasn t even back yet and its been no more than 5 minutes this guy whom i assume is the supervisor cause he was in a different uniform came up to our table aggressively and raised his voice saying order now you sit here so long i explained my wife is in the toilet dont worry once shes out we will order he shouts no order now and flings the menu at my 64 year old dad things have clearly already gone out of hand i tell my parents to pack and i stood up and told him to back off i was fuming this went way too far if my parents and lady were not there this would have gone alot worse we stood up and left i am disgusted by this establishment and would never recommend stepping foot in this horrendous place picture of the supervisor included ,1
interested to try yoogane after seeing the way they cook the food on our table but all are chicken menu and the problem is if we are on the same table we have to choice 1 menu maybe because they cook on our table if you are 3 or 4 people then you have to choose one as a traveler we prefer to try several different foods instead of one choice taste is not bad maybe chicken is not my favorite ,0
on our second day in seoul we tried chicken galbi yoogne in myeongdong shopping town the restaurant that claim themselves as korea s number one chicken galbi has been in the business since 1981 a narrow entrance and staircase brought us to the second floor of the shop we waited around 15 20 min at the staircase as they only have around 15 20 tables and no waiting room we ordered marinated chicken galbi fried rice and the marinated chicken galbi by itself with the addition of extra noodles rice and cheese they are cooked in front of us and everyone was given an apron to prevent any spraying from the cooking main ingredients were chicken cabbage oil and chili chili empowering the whole dish so for some people the dish might be too strong and spicy but it is very delicious kimchi and other pickles were self served and they are fresh for me personally one experience of eating here is enough room is spacious well lighted and clean but one bad thing was that the toilet is outside the dining room and is not very clean and is stinky ,1
it s a dalkalbi chained restaurant you can find easily in some part of seoul yummy food the taste is the best tips save a bit of your chicken and order fried rice at the end they will mix up the rice with the chicken and the leftover sauce it is more delicious than the chicken itself a must try,1
as we saw a lot of local people queuing for this restaurant we decided to go as well you sit at an table with a stove where the attentive and english speaking staff will cook your spicy chicken or seafood for two people i recommend to get the small middle size and to add some rice tteobokki ramen add some extra cheese to combat the spiciness also ask for an apron as the red oil may spatter onto your clothes we really enjoyed this franchise and went again at another location ,1
no matter what time i visit this restaurant it is always packed with customers for muslims you can try their seafood fried rice and add few add ons such as rice cake cheese ramyeon etc good thing is that food is always served within 10 minutes or less ,1
we came here for lunch before our flight back home the restaurant was packed with locals and tourist alike as you can guess all the offerings revolved around chicken food is nice especially with the sauce but for two persons the taste gets heavy midway through the staff are attentive and efficient a smile would be nice though pricing is not expensive and it is value for money the only negative is the food smell make sure you dont bring your favourite heavy coats or go there during your last day so that the smell that lingers doesnt irk you too much ,1
this restaurant serves very large meals with chefs who cook directly in the place overall great taste try it if you go to myeongdong thanks,1
we ate here after a long days walking which may influence my review to be fair i found the menu limited and the place was so busy the staff don t have much time to explain the options or make recommendations i found the side dishes the worst i had in seoul and the chicken seemed poor quality to me and quite fatty ,0
there are 2 outlets within myeongdong limited side dishes basically only pickled radish and kimchi we ordered a set for 2 pax with cheese serving is big enough for 3 pax though like any typical korean restaurants cold water is served to every table ,1
got in request for assistance for a seat with backing for toddler got rejected it s a eat or get out mentality here pure disappointment,0
worth acceptable for the price lessons learned better order good for 3 if you are 2 serving seems small best thing is that your food will be cooked in front of you bad thing is different people crew will cook because everyone is busy in my side total of three different people touch my food but the food was good ,1
in a smaller street if myeongdong a restaurant on two floors soecialised in chicken grilled on the table,1
terrible service and too much customers that they cannot even control it themselves they have left our menu for so long that our menu was all burnt on the bottom we have argued about it to the staffs but they were just like oh that happens the worst place ever,0
yoogane was discussed in several blogs so i tried to give it a go personally it was very smokey inside my eyes can t handle any smoke so i was eating with red eye and crying for the whole lunch because of it the food itself not bad the cheese and noodle toppings will enhance your appetite the service was quite rude this is what i actually experience in some places in korean they tend to ignore you when they can t speak english but hey this is a restaurant and i m sorry i can t tolerate if you leave me when i am speaking and giving my food order to you especially when you do it because you want to serve other table my friends in fact need to calm me down so that i won t leave right in the middle of our lunch perhaps i was too hungry so i easily got mad but hate the service and that uncomfortable smokey place did not help will not come again especially when the taste did not make up for the bad experience ,0
we liked the food here that we ate twice during our 4 day stay in seoul they prepare it in front of you and the ingredients are delicious but beware that it is rather spicy you could also choose salads free of charge the price is also very good for what you get in return which explains the fact that it was always almost full ,1
passing by many times tourist behavior try if you have not tried tables are one of the smallest compared other restarants seats are very packed legs would hit the table legs if two sit together on the same side good for someone who like to eat rice the problem is that the order is counted by the numbers of persons one and only one dish ordered big wak rice the one we ordered is rice with cheese pretty alright and cheap about 6000 won a person free vege raw cabbage and cold soup can eat all you can i did not bordered ,0
we queued for about 20 minutes or so the meal was so so to me i wouldn t bother to line up for this there are much better options in myeondong ,0
great experience and great meal it was tasty and spicy if you don t like much spicy just order steamed rice so you get a bowl of rice don t order as fried rice cause they will put the rice in dakgalbi ,1
horrible service i came with two of my siblings and order a table for 9 people the others were on the way for some reason they told us to come to them when everyone present and command us to wait outside that was very rude since clearly there was a bench beside us to wait for the table and they shove us away like we were beggars the cashier was especially rude he was the one who shove us away whatever you do fellow tourists do not go to yoogane near myeongdong kyoja thats all thank you,0
nothing positive to say about yoogane concept of mixed rice cooked in front of you is great however the rice had no flavor despite the heavy colors it was dry and there was barely any cheese or chicken in the end product i can t rave enough about the food seoul has to offer but best avoid this one ,0
most of customers are foreigners and they push you to order including for small kids other places are more local and friendly,0
the dish was very flavorful after few rounds of it we felt quite yucky mayb becoz we didn t order the instant noodle or rice or cheese to mix together that s y the sauce was too rich in taste ,1
was at myeondong area with my family of four 2a 2c shopping for hours that we accidentally bumped into this chicken galbi restaurant the food we ordered chicken octopus fried noodles is simply delicious and would be easy to accept eat especially for foreigners who are exposed to korean food for the 1st time price wise it is not too expensive but would have to agree with many others that there is certainly room for improvement on their service level from the staff but for the price one is paying and considering this is a so called korean galbi chain we are not too bothered with the so called poor level of service ,0
i just visited this restaurant at myeong dong and i received terrible service i strongly advice you to not petrol this restaurant yoogane if you are unable to communicate in korean i ordered chicken galbi fried rice but they gave me seafood as well based on assumption i am allergy to seafood hence i told them no seafood only chicken then the manager gave me a frustrated and impatient look they claim that they provide the best service to the their customers but i guess not so far we have no other issues with other restaurants we ve visited in korea ,0
i tried this restaurant afew days ago for dinner with my family the food was not very fantastic the staff speaks little english and mandarin they charge by head count the manager was not very polite and he keeps coming to our table for order while we are still discussing what to order he got no patient to explain how the price was charge untill the next table customer explained to us after we ordered the food they will cook the food for us self service of the side dish only pickle radish and cabbage overall taste of the food is nothing fantastic stress manager overall dining feeling is below average ,0
we visited at 11am for lunch on a weekday and we were seated right away waiter spoke some english we ordered 2 of their best galbi dish without cheese we had to do 2 orders as per the waiter we couldn t just order 1 it was very good and cooked well by staff i would recommend trying their food ,1
this restaurant is located in the centre of myeong dong in the evening the restaurant is crowded the staff holds is not to say that unfriendly rather in the distance this can be understood the number of visitors is very much the main trick for tourists the food is prepared in front of you for koreans it is quite trivial prepared is probably a strong word rather mixed and heated this allows you to feel involved in the process the food itself is ordinary nothing supernatural i d define as korean fastfood so the prices are quite humane ,0
very crowded restaurant staff was not so friendly after ordering food and drink they soon come and prepare the food in a pan which is in front of you for me the food was so so and the portion is quite small ,0
i m unsure whether it was just at the time of our visit that the food tasted poor or if it s all the time really bad i ordered the seafood gal bi fried rice with cheese and my rice was very dry the seafood was overcooked until it shrunk into tiny proportions and i could not tell if it was a squid or prawn or shellfish that i was eating the food really tasted so so however there s a self serve station for kimchi soup and shredded cabbage for you to help yourself with the waitress frying up our food took her time serving others as well hence the very dry fried rice i didn t know if we re allowed to fry the food ourselves but when i tried to touch the frying spatula the waitress hissed at me i don t know if it s just me or they just don t like tourists the price however is pretty much cheap compared to other type of restaurants ,0
for me it s just basic korean food once you re out of the resto you will smell like the food too plus the man in the counter was rude ,0
smell good when u walk pass this restn it is smelly once u sitted inside and eat food portion is small want to leave this restn immediately cause it is smelly so never order much service is normal decent meal ,0
i noticed with other reviews that getting a table for one could be a problem but luckily for me it wasn t the best is to compare this to any fast food restaurant don t expect a great service or a fine dining experience but the food is good fast and cheap after ordering your food and drink they soon come and prepare the food in a pan which is in front of you when the food is done it s time to enjoy the food itself has a great flavour and the portion is sufficient if you are a big eater you might want to order a side dish if you need something you press the button and otherwise you go to the cashier to pay and leave a great place for a quick bite if you prefer to spent your time on other things in seoul ,1
i always go to yoogane at least once whenever i visit myeongdong the food and rice are okay it s a pretty busy place and always full of people so i suggest going here at around 11am to be make sure you are seated at once ,1
came here for lunch with another 4 people the food is absolutely delicious and authentic korean spicy but shiok ,1
i went on april 2017 the restaurant quite easy to find a lot of halal restaurant around there i think its the best nasi goreng dont know in korean name i ate in seoul the price u know quite pricy if convert but among the cheapest in myeongdong ,1
we came across yoogane a few times walking up and down the market area and decided to google it back at the hotel before visiting since we saw a lot of people queuing to go in not realising that it was one of the must try places please note that if you re looking for top service then this may not be the correct place for you it s an establishment to enjoy the atmosphere of the galbi being cooked in front of you we waited for about 10 15 minutes and eventually got seated table still being half cleaned as we sat down had a more older waitress waiting us she tried her best to explain to us how it worked but communication barrier broke down a bit and not to her fault we chose the standard chicken galbi and ordered additional rice to go with it everything arrived pretty quick and was soon on the fire cooking the service staff must rotate in the tables since we didn t really see the original waitress again you re able to stir the ingredients yourself or the staff will come around periodically doing it either way it can be fun so enjoy it once cooked we were asked if we wanted the rice added in as well note the rice is supposed to be added after you ve eaten some of it and not added in straight when the cheese chicken and veg is cooked the new waiter that s come to our table asked if we wanted but didn t advise that it should be done after only knowing after it was added its meant to be cooked with the left overs to soak up the remaining flavours on the palate overall a decent visit but a smelly one was nice but would go back to eat it properly next time be prepared for your clothes to smell after so wear something that you re prepared to go without for the remaining trip ,1
went there in a group of 5 adults and 2 children they couldn t accommodate all of us on one table we were split to 2 tables they will insist each adult to have a serving even if one person said she is not hungry and won t be eating waitress arrived with cooking tray and was just banging everything she had a grumpy face the whole time when she was cooking our food never mention to us to self serve our own side dishes lucky we saw ourselves food was nothing special the chicken galbi with vegetables had lots of cabbage and spring onions the noodles were a bit burnt will not recommend this place look for another chicken galbi place if you want to eat this food ,0
this is one of the famous and always crowded touristy restaurants in myeong dong area good one to try different galbi dishes done limitations exist like all in the table should order the same type of galbi as there is only one pan per table anyways a decent place to try galbi in the famous shopping area of myeong dong ,1
my friend and i had chicken galbi fried rice with bean sprouts and cheese serving is good but with very few chicken on it so more of a rice with the hot paste and the bean sprouts the staff would cook it in front of you but the cheese is a bit burnt because they put it at the bottom there s a small counter for side dishes at the center radish and cabbage the staff won t mention it to you though so you just have to be observant will probably try just the chicken galbi next time ,1
tourist trap rude staff they just want you to eat and get out of their way food is just ok no big deal very smoky your clothes and hair will come out smelling like bbq for days and the smell of chilli is so strong that i couldn t stop coughing because of it ,0
stepped into the restaurant and at the same moment the cashier who was 5 meters away shouted to me if i m only 1 person i said yes in a very rude manner he said they do not serve people who come alone terrible rude unfriendly service i will never come again ,0
we heard that this would be a good place to eat because of the food but we sorely regretted coming here because of the horrible service after we sat down our waitress was rude and had attitude with us likely because she did not speak much english she even gave us looks while we were ordering because she had a difficult time understanding because she had a difficult time understanding she placed the wrong order without even checking with us and then telling us that we can t change it because it has already been placed after that she did not try to check in with us and another server had to help us with the food we never saw the waitress again during our meal the table next to us were also tourists and we could tell they had some confusion with what they ordered and their waiter was impatient with them and rudely asked a server to deal with them i would think because this location is in a tourist district that they would cater to tourists but they really fail with that it seems to be always busy despite the poor service probably because of its prime location will not be visiting again or recommending it to others the food was okay despite not what we wanted to order ,0
my friend who was visiting from bangkok wanted to try something different so we decided to dine here after a long day of shopping honestly i am not a fan of dakgalbi so i probably would have never ate here if it wasn t for my friend the waiter wasn t friendly or rude but we were able to order our food and got what we needed we went after the lunch rush but there were still a lot of diners and it was busy our food came shortly and we chatted while waiting for the chicken to be cooked all the way i thought the food was just average and wasn t spicy enough but my friend who never had dakgalbi before loved it we loved dipping our chicken in cheese and the fried rice they made for us at the end i m glad my friend enjoyed her meal but i probably won t visit on my own ,0
never have i ever placed a 1 star review on tripadvisor nor walked out of a resturaunt so confused and angry me and my partner went to this restaurant as our first bbq experience small menu so we tried to order a bbq chicken dish for 2 people 23000 won as well as another chicken rice dish 6000 won as we were so hungry was told we could not order both dishes we didnt understand why this was so tried to clarify and our waiter was so rude treating us like we were stupid we continually tried saying we wanted both and was not given a clear explanation as to why we had to choose one or the other why is it that your resturaunt would not allow us to spend the extra money for one extra dish also found it odd the treatment of other customers wanting to come in to the restaurant by the man at the front not even a smile on his face very abrupt lack of service standards are clearly reflected in many reviews as we found out after exiting the resturaunt and searching it up online we ended up walking out without ordering anything and found a better resturaunt with much better service ,0
first off if you are visiting korea chicken bbq galbi is one of the must food you must try so there s hundreds of restaurants you can go to so i would say yoogane is pretty popular with tourists and locals it s a chain but they are consistent and good it s spicy but you can order non spicy for children or those who don t want spicy like everyone says they cook the food in front of you so it does get smelly but so does every local bbq joints in korea so cover your jackets with their aprons they provide or put it in a shopping bag if you have them this helps reduce the after effects they have frebreez type spray by the exit if you can t live with the smell i would say it s almost a three course meal first your chicken bbq you can add whatever you want to make it more customized to your tasting such as cheese udon noodles etc second course you order the fried rice which they take your leftover chicken bbq and its sauces and mix white rice and other little ingredients after you get your filling of rice then you order your third entree which is naeg mun cold water noodle it s has some sweet and vinegar taste it s a nice way to refresh after the hot and spicy food it s nothing fancy but it s a nice way to get some culture and local food the hard part is finding this place it s tucked away with all other shops ,1
found this restaurant just off the main myeondong shopping street its on the inner lane just opposite olive young price wise reasonable and the food was good if you love it spicy can get them to add more chilli paste very tasty and you can either add rice or noodles wt your galbi highly recommended and usually quite crowded during dinner time ,1
my daughter has always been a big fan of yoogane so we squeezed time to find the store in myeongdong luckily when we got there there was no line but we need to wait for a couple of minutes to have our table prepared since we are 5 in all their tables are designed for 4 only service was fast but since the place is too crowded the place is really quite tight and small by the time we were eating the number of people queuing outside has started to grow the service crew are always busy going from one table to another table so expect that 3 to 4 crew will be checking your food being cooked ,1
the restaurant is easy to find in myeongdong the service was good but the ventilation was terrible my wife and i sneezed the entire time we struggled to even taste our food the restaurant is also packed which further exacerbates the lack of air flow ,0
yoogane is available in many places so does in myeong dong shopping area they sell fried rice but you can have add on such as udon do add on udon they have chicken fried rice or seafood for muslims go for the seafood by the way the food will be prepared right in front of your eyes ,1
food served was fast the waiters waitresses stirred the food for you till it is cooked and told us nicely we could start eating helpful and friendly staff a must to try when you are in myeongdong ,1
this is not a nice restaurant their ventilation system doesn t work all the oily and pungent smell make me and my friends sneeze nonstop and because all the sneezing i can t even taste their food properly they have the very worst service i ve ever experienced in seoul their horrible attitude and bad service that left me feeling like we couldn t leave there fast enough ,0
my children treated me to this food joint this evening it was cold as the first snow for 2016 happen today couple with huge crowd doing a candlelight demonstration asking the president to step down i dislike the cold and reluctantly went along i am glad i did we had both the spicy and normal woks i enjoyed the food help by some cold beer ,1
very nice restaurant convenient location in center of myeong dong shopping street delicious food and friendly staff many local korean come here for lunch and dinner ,1
we stopped for dinner in this popular restaurant for dinner it s one of a chain of restaurants where they cook at your table we choose their signature dish of chicken and cabbage mixed with red sauce and rice which was good our waiter brought the ingredients and cooked them at first we thought it was because we were foreigners but then we noticed that other waiters were doing the same at other customers table be prepared to wait in line for some time if you arrive at rush hour there is a food station where one can get some appetizers and sauces bathroom is downstairs ,1
really enjoyed the food and atmosphere in this place and could of eaten in this place every night of the week we had to que to get in for about 15 mins but there was no rush for us to eat and get out the service was good and everywhere was clean the staff helpful and spoke reasonable english they showed us how and what to order to make things simple and we had a great meal ,1
no chances to order as person in charge unhappy that we change table and purposely do not want to take our order and give instructions to the rest of the waitress cannot serve us very bad experience in seoul myeongdong ,0
another halal restaurant to try while in seoul they count the price by head so if you come as 2 people ordering menu with price of 10k won the final price would be 20k won we ordered octopus chicken with white rice they cook the food for you so hold your droll affordable price for a tasty food ,1
there are 2 stores just in myeongdong went to both of them the store which is on the 1st level was a lot more crowded their dakgalbi was drier compared to the other store which was on the 2nd level taste wise was the same pretty good food and staff were kind and not rude there were complimentary sides of kimchi lettuce and etc a good tip is to let the staff cook and just wait til they say you can enjoy your food ,1
great restaurant right in the heart of the myeongdong area of seoul decided to try it based on the close proximity to where we are staying and the line out the front see pic we went around 18 00 and there was no line out front but by the time we left at around 19 30 there was a line of locals down the street the menue had an english translation which made it really easy to understand what we were ordering the 2 of us got 2x orders of the chicken and octopus galbi with 2x sides of rice and 1x serve of cheese our waitress then proceeded to prepare the food right in front of us in a giant bbq built into our table by progressively adding the rice and cheese into the bbq the meal itself took about 15 20 minutes all up to prepare and was very filling and absolutely delicious if you like chilli food the way we do then you won t be disappointed the prices were also really reasonable at least by australian standards would recommend and go again ,1
we ordered the cheese chicken galbi noodles and they provided us bibs then proceeded to cook the meat prepare the meal for us all you do is seat and wait to eat enjoy the smell in the process you can also get complimentary sides of kimchi lettuce clear beansprout soup would definitely visit again when back in seoul ,1
when you walk in you get a whif of chill pepper you may cough the taste is okay but its not a fancy place the food is pretty basic the free sides at the bar are very blah shredded cabbage radish and kimchee ugh they don t even provide rice when you order the chicken for the price you can get a much better meal somewhere else ,1
delighted by the place and food is very good fried fresh onion spring onion rice cakes and cabbage with chewy noodles sides are yelow pickeled radishes kimshi cabbage cold soup and green apple coleslaw freshvegetable korean foodies,1
being my first time in south korea wandering through myeongdong i unwittingly stumbled across this gem being packed with a que of people to get a table why not give it a try the food was excellent with a true taste of seoul a side of soju ,1
we stopped at the door of restaurant when we were looking for traditional cusine korean we choose seafood migoraeng and spicy iced noodles the taste was very great i liked noodles but it was a bit spicy with me i had to drink water my friend was ok with her dish ,1
ok i am not sure how authentic the food at this place is but i dakar galbi stried fried chicken with korean sauce and other vegetables the sauce is spicy but add rice to the mix you have a winner on your hand i first ate this dish at this restaurant and have been going back on my every trip to seoul and not has been disappointed at usd10 it is a steal for a good meal ,1
it was a pleasant experience all in all we were handed aprons when we sat down at our tables to prevent clothing stains febreeze are provided as well after you re done with eating however instructions were not given well as to what we were supposed to do once the dakgalbi arrived my friends and i were confused for a moment on whether we had to cook it by ourselves or if we had to wait for the staff to help us with it not a big issue as we observed what the other customers did the food was slightly spicy for me cause i can t take spice well but my other friends enjoyed it very much but after eating it together with lots of cheese i overcame the spiciness and was able to enjoy the meal as well ,1
we went for lunch to try korean famous dakgalbi at first we try the sea food dish but the octopus was not cooked and its hard to chew but we go for a second try and have dakgabi with cheese and it was so delicious ,1
marinated sea food rice and cold beer is prepaid by garçon and some korean pickle and coleslaw salad with delicious taste taken by open buffet good price nice air condition area with hot tray pay cash ,1
right at the middle of myeongdong this famous dakgalbi restaurant attracts lots of tourists anytime of the day the restaurant is kinda dirty and smokey and the seats are very very near to each other it feels crampy and uncomfortable the dakgalbi here is pretty good there are some varieties you can choose from or add some ingredients to the basic dish cheese is recommended staff here is not friendly and always very busy not very attentive either the price here is more expensive compared to other branches i would recommend people to go to other less touristy branches for better service food quality and price ,1
we went for dinner at this restaurant as we wanted to have a korean experience food was good we had chicken galbi it wwas very busy it felt like they turning and serving like a machine not a very clean restaurant be prepared to be served very fast by a hasty waiters food is little spicy as well ,1
we went there for a late lunch so it wasn t too busy and got a table for three quite quickly after we had sat down and looked at the menu it did take a while for staff to approach us and take our order we ordered three portions of beansprout galbi one portion of rice and an extra portion of sweet potato tteokbokki staff would come over every few minutes to stir and make sure the food was cooked as the food is cooking in front of you you are treated to the most wonderful smell it tasted great not as spicy as it looks and the portions were more than enough for us you can help yourself to pickled radish cabbage and sauces at the back of the restaurant definitely worth eating there ,1
we had a wonder and delicious dak galbi here the restaurant itself is right in myeongdong and gets very busy at night the staff is friendly and provides an english menu and aprons for eating the dak galbi is cooked in front of you and you don t have to do anything to it you can help yourself to korean veggies lettuce and kimchi at a self service station and the staff provides you with water the overall spice level isn t too bad but i believe you can request it to be higher you can also add additional meats and cheese to your meal if you want we would definitely recommend going here if you re in seoul ,1
very yummy bought the chicken and octopus and added 2 portions of cheese must worth visiting at least once for the food however service is only average impatient servers at best major drawback i smell of my lunch for the rest of day ,1
yoogane is scattered all across seoul and it serves a really decent tasting meal coupled with its salad bar the food is cooked in front of you and you re given aprons to wear during the meal thumbs up to them as white shirts can be saved they have a new dish which is cheese fondue with the chicken i didn t have that but i d like to try it as it looks really good and is a few won more only get the sticky noodles and not the ramen if you want some carbs they fry it in with the chicken ,1
my hubby and i loved the food so much it was fragrant and delicious must add cheese it was so good we went back to eat it again before leaving seoul one thing we didn t like was that we left the restaurant smelling like bbq but the food is great ,1
a variety of kimchi type fried rice we had the garlic flavor and was just divine would go back again plenty of space for younger kids not sure if they have high chair but there s definitely plenty of room for it ,1
my friend who lived in seoul took us here as she knows that we are moslem we were having difficulties in finding halal restaurants during our stay in south korea so yeah this was quite pleasant for us to finally try a korean food while in korea ha we had this ceese chicken galbi i personally love the sauce very much spicy and yet the sweetness of it was just nice the chewiness of it mozzarella is also addictive the price was also valuable and affordable for large groups ,1
i came here for lunch and the restaurant was quite crowded but we still got table thanks to the fast response staff every one coming here must order food one of my friend didn t feel to eat but the staff said that us three must order food okay then we ordered 3 portion of fried rice with extra topping of mozarella cheese the taste was good at first it looked like the portion is small but after you start to eat you ll feel full easily there were free water and side dishes like simple salad and radishes too the staff will also help you cook the ordered food if you order chicken galbi first they will pour the ingredients chicken toppoki vegetables on the hot pan on your table you won t know what to do next with that thing but don t worry because in 5 7 minutes later a staff will cook it for you and you can eat it then ,1
food was great price was reasonable but the service was terrible the staff was unfriendly and did not entertain our questions and he looked overworked ,1
best galbi i ever had clean table and surroundings delicious and fast serving smiling waitresses overall a very good impression ,1
i was caught up in the middle of lunch time in myeongdong shopping district and i am super starving that very moment seen this yoogane restaurant that i kept seeing in korean drama twenty again out of curiousity and because so many people keep coming and going plus my growling stomach really pushing me to go inside i found myself sitting not knowing what and how i will order good thing their staffs are all friendly and so nice to tell me the good ones they have and enough portion for solo customer like me i have chosen marinated chicken galbi fried rice since i need a heavy meal just so timing i m in a very cold weather hence i m just so excited to know that it is a bit spicy but i was wrong cos it is actually very spicy when i tasted it the awesome part was the staff who assisted me is so kind enough to cook it in front of me and i never regret having it as the dish is impeccably delish excellent i had a meal for just 6000 won or 6 dollars ,1
at our first day in seoul we were just looking a place for our first dinner we were checking trip advisor found this place as it was the nearest location we have to wait for the table but was not that long after 10 minutes we got out tables friendly staff and some were speaking english food was delicious complimentary ice water and selection of salad kimci reasonable price and the restaurant was never empty worth a visit,1
if you visit korea without doing one meal at yoogane you will regret it wonderful food great service informal cheap beyond belief try chicken galbi for two with extra cheese with a pepsi and a meg ju all for less than 20 you ll leave full and happy and with change in your pocket sorted ,1
ordered the fried rice for 2 and it was cooked by the staff on the spot the serving was substantial and tasted great when hot ,1
we had marinated seafood fried rice which a mix of octopus strips kimchi cabbage korean paste seaweed korean rice and lots of vegies which cost us 5 000 won not bad for a whole pan full of fried rice and unlimited refill of side dishes kimchi radish cabbage kimchi soup and drinks ,1
we came after reading the good reviews this place is packed and buzzing we went for the seafood and chicken dish with extra rice for two people for about 30 000w it was great to see the food cooked at your table it was fast service food was amazing like spicy paella we went back three times in our visit as it was the best place by far definitely go ,1
fresh food cooking front of you by the stuff with testy sizzling or fried rice with spicy the food was light it s good trying,1
visited this place for their one pot meal they ll set a big pan with vegetables chicken chilli paste on your table and staff will stir fry till well done quite a experience you can add portion of rice ramen cheese to suit your taste around 10 000w per head and upwards ,1
this is one of the alternative for muslim tourist where they can try yoogane s seafood fried rice the side dishes are free flow and you can help yourself as much as you can but do not waste its a little crowded as the tables are quite near to one another and have a loud environment the food is a little bit spicy for average kind of person note each person must order one set means you cant eat 2 person and order one set to share and apart from rice you can add in ramyun as well ,1
we chanced upon this restaurant cos my mom didnt wanna eat beef saw the pictures of spicy chicken cooking in a big round hot plate with an outer rim of cheese looked good we ordered n the food was good didn t regret ,1
writing this as the dakgalbi is cooking poor first impression lousy service forced ordering already gave a bad taste even before i bite into my first piece of chicken you d rather go to a less popular dakgalbi restaurant than give your to a restaurant that thinks its too popular to forget about service quality and overall customer experience ,0
love the food here and the service was good you can choose to mix and match sides with the main dak galbi choice best of all it s easy on the wallet too ,1
for our first meal in korea our companion accompanied and suggested this place to us they have unlimited salad and kimchi the food is ok a big pan of rice with toppings of your choice then they ll cook it in front of you price range 5k won per person if you re not a rice person this will be too much for you the servers can speak passable english ,1
this may sound cliche but this place is the bomb the people here are nice side dishes are on point food cooked right in front of you spacious and most of all all ingredients are very fresh ,1
its quite hard to find halal restaurant in seoul unless you go to itaewon but this restaurant offer no pork dishes in all of his menu we order seafood fried rice which is quite tasty ,1
the taste of food is nice and the price is reasonable however the service not really nice all the staff work like zombie all the shop no one can speak either english or chinese we want to change rice from normal rice to fried rice because we order wrongly the guy staff said no no and left without help anything only a guy who wear shirt which i thought he s the manager help us change and cook for us ,0
my family 5 of us decided to to gave dak agalbi so i decided to go to yoogani here in myeongdong it was about 2pm the waiters did not even offer us seats when there were so many tables available we wanted to look at the menu but they did not even offer us the menu i had to get menu myself this was my second time in korea this was the worst experience they seem not in the mood to entertain the guests coming in we ve been calling their attention but they jst ignored our calls they were do rude very poor service we all just decided to walked out onstead of having our food there seems lije they do not lije foreigners entering their restaurant ,0
we visited yoogane for lunch one sunday the staff who attended to us were very pleasant and helpful if at all they didn t speak english very much and perhaps that s why they may come across as unfriendly we had chicken and small octopus for 3 and 1 portion of fried rice it turned out to be just nice for 3 hungry adults ,0
don t worry if you can t find there are 3 i think so restaurants in myeongdong shopping area the spicy chicken can be really hot we tried the cheese version it was really yummy how to order just point at menu and sit back the restaurant staff will cook for you ,1
we d never had korean before and i d been wanting to try this for a while we let our server know we d never had it before and she gave us some recommendations we ended up going with the beef bulgogi and the dolsot bibimbap both were great it is important to know that some of the food is season to taste so plan to add some of the table sauce and soy sauce to make it how you like it the appetizer sides that came with each entree were great too service was excellent and everyone was very friendly lots of regulars while we were there ,1
i really was unsure of how much of the menu would appeal to me at korea house but i went with a large group that order several dishes they were all excellent my favorite dish was the seafood pancake but really enjoyed the chicken bulgogi fried dumplings and fried rice as well i definitely recommend korea house it s not fancy but it s good food also the staff were great dealing with our large group and the food came out fast and hot you can bring your own wine for a 5 corkage fee ,1
absolutely delicious authentic korean food served in a no frills tiny space in an otherwise drive by shopping center on charlotte pike go early or late to get a table or just plan to take out the wonderful small trays of side dishes that come with every meal come first and are so good they ll be gone before your food arrives ours were and the bibimbap is worth driving across the state for ,1
the banchan or side dishes that they serve are what i love about this restaurant there s about 8 different kinds and they re very consistent in terms of quality preparation and taste i also regularly get the doenjang jiggae usually to go the place can get crowded pretty quickly at peak meal times there aren t too many tables and no waiting area ,1
my eleven year old twins beg to get biminbop on days off of school we drive 45 minutes for the best around ,1
dont go here for ambiance but if you want bulgogi mandy soju great lunch the meal comes with rice and about 7 seven other side dishes radish and cabbage kimchi marinated bean sprouts tofu egg dish sweet radish etc get a cold soju to split or barley tea split an entree because you get such a large serving yummy it s a good meal service is fast and pleasant plenty of parking locals koreans also eat here worth a drive ,1
quick visit for lunch first time eating korean food this place isn t big or fancy but it s small and friendly and the food is excellent i can recommend the chicken bugolgi ,1
heard great things about korea house and decided to take dh here as a surprise dinner for our anniversary wow i m not a huge korean food fan but dh loves it i figured i could find something here and boy did i yum e as recommended by others the chicken bulgogi was delicious don t skip the fried potstickers dh said they tasted like the ones in seoul he had the bibimbop and said it was delicious as others mentioned the place is small with kitchy decor service and food quality were 100 and top notch i m all in on the korea house we ll be back ,1
one of our favorite places nothing much in the decor but service and food are wonderful i will say that i ve eaten there more than 10 times and only have gotten the chicken lettuce wraps they re so good that i can t bring myself to order anything else pretty small place we only go on off times ,1
this is a small but very good place specializing in authentic korean food and not fusion they offer numerous delicious hot soups as well as awesome hot pork and other meats the place is very good ,1
korea house is a tiny strip mall restaurant close to sylvan park we went for dinner on a thursday and were able to sit down immediately i noticed that some folks were getting to go orders so that is an option as well the service was good and the food explained to us when we asked i have zero experience with korean food but i found everything tasty the side dishes are fun prices are moderate and parking plentiful this is a very casual place they do take credit cards ,1
today i went to korea house i was assigned to south korea from 1991 1993 and i developed a love of korean food i had bulgogi and several small side dishes like kimchi pickled radishes pickled bean sprouts etc the dishes were all delicious and the service exceptional if you have an affinity for korean food i recommend korea house ,1
i ordered the chicken bulgogi and the flavors were phenomenal i got it with regular heat which is spicy but tolerable to finish the meal the vegetables were mixed and sautéed well portions were very appropriate for someone with a large appetite rice was sticky and moist without being mushy there was a bit of wait as it was very crowded but i would say it s worth the wait they make up in quality what they are lacking in ambience and decor the staff was nice and quick ,1
my first experience with korean food i was skeptical that i d like it but i absolutely loved everything on the table tiny little place that stays busy very reasonable prices and the food is deeeelicious friendly staff authentic food and atmosphere love this place ,1
this is one of the best restaurants in nashville small place but the service is awesome the food is amazing i live everything about it ,1
our first time here made me wonder if i d ever had a korean dish like this before it is a simple restaurant i told the waitress i wanted something with pork and she told me to get the bulgogi my wife had the beef version many cold side ms served with it along with lettuce to we assumed use for eating similar to a lettuce wrap except these were longer skinny romaine leaves i think food was very tasty ,0
i need to be more adventurous here and get more than bibimbap or korean bbq but both of those things are so so good here that i rarely stray generous portions full of vegetables nice touches like freshly fried eggs on top and those steaming clay bowls are awesome they bring out a lot of sides banchan to the table for everyone to share good variety of dishes like kimchi bean sprouts potatoes etc staff is always welcoming and friendly all those awards are well earned ,1
hands down the most authentic korean experience i ve had back in the states the food is delicious and prepared by what appears to be a family make sure to eat your fill while you re there because korean food has the tendency to make itself known in the fridge i ve seen some complaints about service but they operate just like restaurants in korea do you ve got to tell them you want something and it ll be on the table in no time flat the only downside is that i didn t have the stomach to eat everything on the menu they basically have all of the classics that you could possibly want if i lived closer this would be a weekly spot ,1
my wife and i both enjoy korean food very much but it is very difficult to find in many cities in the south this restaurant was rated as the best korean food in the nashville area so we tried it i had the kimchee soup with beef and mary had bulgogi we were served the traditional little side dishes with our meal and these are always my way of separating the good from the very best the kim chee itself was on the rather tame side i did not request the really dilish hot stuff and am sorry i did not however it was very good and the soup was outstanding to the last drop and it was served in a huge bowl which i lifted and drained just like i used to do in korea the bulgogi was also very good the service was friendly and helpful and relatively fast and the prices were reasonable if you want to try korean food this is a very good place to do it with good food and a large selection to choose from i cannot remember the name of the red paste they always bring in a side dish which looks like ketchup but i can say that it is what stole the show for me here i dipped everything i could in it and it was scrumptious ,1
four folk for dinner staff explained all dishes even going into detail for the newcomers next to us who d not had korean food tasty dishes ample sized portions simple unadorned storefront no ambience at all save good food noisy when crowded expect to speak loudly and be heard by others at close in tables ,1
this restaurant has delicious korean food we recommend the bibimbap and the galbi they make their own kimchi and it is very tasty their service is quick and friendly the restaurant is busy at lunch on the weekend ,1
very small restaurant in a strip mall most authentic korean food ive hade in a long time their service is great but the food is excellent,1
decided to have my last lunch of 2016 at korea house i know there s a chinese new year but is there korean new year the iphone didn t capitalize korean new year but did for chinese new year so i guess not anyway back to korea house located in a strip mall along charlotte pike it s a rather small and unassuming restaurant we had a party of six and were at immediately but we also arrived at open i can see where this place would fill up rather quickly because of the small size as my first time here and i think my first time at a korean place i skimmed the pictures on here and got a couple tips from some friends who d ate here before i went with the chicken bulgogi 14 99 i wasn t sure what it was but the bulgogi seemed like the popular thing on the menu it came with a bunch of different sides we had a table of 6 and they brought out two ordered of sides for the table the portion for the chicken bulgogi was large it also came with a container of steamed white rice i mixed some of the rice in with the main dish and put a little of the sauce from the bottle onto my plate it was a little spicy but not insanely spicy i enjoyed it and would probably get it again if i went back ,1
the beef japchae and bulgogi are to die for and their bibimbap is toasty and filling great place for lunch and dinner go early because the place fills up fast the owner is on site and the staff are very friendly and helpfull can t say enough good about this restaurant ,1
i love korea house i was introduced to korea house 2 3 years ago and immediately was hooked wonderful food friendly staff i highly recommend korea house if you are looking for a korean food fix,1
this nashville restaurant is nestled in a little strip center on the west side there are about 12 tables and you may have to wait a bit if you show up during prime time but it will be well worth the wait the service is great and the food is spectacular very flavorful great sized portions the staff is very good at suggesting something if you aren t quite sure what to get the prices are fair food is great no excuse not to go there ,1
the food was amazing however the restaurant has won best of eleven years running i asked the owner if i had applied the correct sauce whereupon she took my chosticks from my hand and prepared my dish that was so awesome ,1
i stumbled across korea house by accident while in search of another location nearby what i found was an incredible eating experience i got so much food and every bite was good i can t wait to take my wife there someday ,1
this restaurant never disappoints we where all in need of comfort food and the staff at korea house provided it will style and warm smiles ,1
this is a fantastic hole in the wall that is always full to the brim of people who don t speak english you know a restaurant is great when it seems to be a gathering place for the local community of wherever they happen to be from the service is fantastic the food authentic and its all very well priced this is a not a fancy place so don t expect frills but do expect fantastic food ,1
we had family dinner at korea house and it was amazing food is the best takes a little time to get it but they always busy worth the wait very nice and friendly people wish they would expand their restaurant ,1
i have never dined in i just order it to go i always get the bulgogi with extra gochujang each time there s always something different included the meat is seasoned perfectly ,1
in today s world of cookie cutter chain restaurants and the thing of the moment menu items it is so rewarding to find a family owned restaurant presenting the ethnic food of their home country and they present it well and at a tremendous value four of us began with the wonderful seafood pancake accompanied with a sauce the waiter explained to us simply as pancake sauce just wonderful then we ordered an entree of beef of shrimp of pork and the kimchee rice we all had to laugh when we received our food with the companion dishes that come with any entree order we had covered every inch of our table with various dishes and sauces i won t list everything we ordered previous reviewers have listed their own favorites but it was all good and some great especially the seafood pancake and we finished every morsel no reservations so come early or you will wait for a table ,0
the food here is absolutely fantastic always consistent if you re looking for ambiance this is not the place for you ,1
the food is excellent and the staff super friendly the restaurant looked very clean with good light and seating the price is reasonable and the food memorable i live about an hour and a half away and have traveled to nashville just to eat here before they give you a very large portion along with the sides everyone at my table always leaves with a doggie bag or a doggie cup if they got soup the only downside is the restaurant is very small and everyone loves the place so if you come during the lunch or dinner rush be prepared to wait in line ,1
i would give korea house a 4 5 it can t get a 5 simply because of the atmosphere it is totally a dive that said the food is excellent the dolsot bibimbap is excellent the bulgogi is also very good the service is average the value is great i would have no problem giving them a 5 if the atmosphere was a little nicer and the service a little better that said i would recommend this place to anyone ,1
you can t get better korean then at the korean house food is spectacular and the service is great expect a short wait but well worth it we try to go at least once a month ,1
arrived early on a friday night and when we left at 6 30 the line was out the door tried soup bbq beef pancake and bibimbap bibimbap was the best all of the sides were delicious too tiny place ethnic feel great food ,1
delightful little family korean cafe this was my first experience with this cuisine and it was pleasant the kimchi fried rice with pork and fried egg was very good the portion was huge and combined with the veggies was an awesome sized lunch service was friendly a return visit to sample other dishes is assured ,1
don t go for atmosphere it s a strip mall storefront with a small dining room but the food it came out fast and it was wonderful the staff were busy but still friendly and efficient i will be back ,1
those of us in the nashville advertising community are a fairly tight knit bunch joe and i made a date for lunch and he suggested korea house on charlotte sure thing was my reply when i arrived on the scene joe was seated and i told him as i sat down that it was my first time not only at korea house but also to try korean food his immediate response was that he assumed i d been there with his cousin judy also an advertising vet and dear buddy of mine the place was shabby chic populated by diners who were largely seemingly korean a korean tv station was on the screens followed joe s lead and ordered the 16 dolsot bibimbap rice topped with vegetables and beef bits and a fried egg in a hot stone pot when our dishes arrived on he table they were literally sizzling the waitress with a beautiful smile had brought us small dishes of assorted additions to mix into our stone pots we mixed and blended the results were a delicious cacophony of flavors have to confess upon entry i was a bit worried glad i followed joe s lead with 16 just really great going back for sure thanks joe for introducing me to korea house totally enjoyed a new nashville favorite ,1
family owned authentic korean food the food is very delicious and in very reasonable price waitress are very nice and helpful highly suggest to anyone want to try authentic korean food with very unexpensive price ,1
my 1st time for this cuisine made even more pleasant w my lunch around the world group of 10 server jennifer was understanding about our cluelessness re korean food and kindly made a suggestion to help firm my choice and several others made the same decision yummy beef veggies rice served in a hot iron pot topped w egg the place is small and clean unencumbered by décor but welcoming to an almost capacity lunch bunch who seemed surprised to see our 10 seated perhaps in their usual spots we ll be back ,1
this was my first time experiencing korean fod and it was great two of us ordered beef bolgogi and one of us chicken bolgolgi it was very good and plentiful portions the kimshi was amazing cabbage cucumber and other we will do this again looks like a hole in the wall but don t let that stop you from experiencing great food and service ,1
you may not give this restaurant a second look if driving down charlotte but it s definitely worth the stop the food was delicious and hot both temperature and spice and you get a lot of it some lunch items were served in a steaming stone pot that kept the food cooking throughout the entire meal the menu is authentic korean cuisine with nearly 100 options to choose from however it s not somewhere to go if you are looking for a quick business lunch lunch lasted about 90 minutes it s also not good for large groups go with a group of 4 or less ,0
this is where i take my family whenever we are celebrating i love to share the food of my mother s side of the family with mine my kids love to go it s a treat every time i don t know what people are saying about the service i ve been going here for years and always have a friendly face eating here you can t go wrong ,1
we have been to korea house a few times the food is consistently good and is pretty cheap overall i order the bimbimbap with beef which comes with all the classic korean side accompaniments it comes out served in a hot stone or clay pot so that the bottom of the rice gets extremely crispy which makes it absolutely delicious another staple we normally get is the beef ribs they come with scallions and a wonderful sauce on a hot plate i absolutely love their house made hot sauce it is like a korean style sirachai sooo good the only things we haven t been huge fans of were the seafood pancake and the tripe soup the seafood pancake was almost inedible because it was so fishy tasting even with having a few dishes we would never order again the food is consistently pretty good service is ok its not fine dining or even like a regular restaurant the set up is a little cramped style but is normally full because its probably the best korean in nashville ,1
as out of towners we asked my bro where he d like to dine for his birthday we ended up at korea house initial impressions were not great little strip mall tiny crowded room folks standing in line outside should have been our first clue the service was slow but the food was oh so wonderful like beef bulgogi bibimbap eight sides to share fresh ingredients served hot authentic flavors dynamite experience and would like to sample other menu items soon ,0
korea house is not about appearances it s a simple square dining room about 20x30 feet in diameter tables sit as close together as possible and you can sit side by side in the center section i love it authentic cuisine and native language customers make this diner a fun wonderful place the smells emitting from the kitchen are full of spice and flavor before you even taste it all the dishes i see make my mouth water i m having the fried dumplings and the galbi pork short ribs i m writing this as i wait any time i get around good food i get excited there is nothing better than being able to enjoy wonderful cuisine in a relaxing speed food does not need to be hurried and this one is not fried dumplings are perfect small enough to be bite size crispy and flavorful conversation and someone to share with might make it better but my love affair with the food here kinda puts that on the back burner main meal arrived eight sides and a big platter of meat it s hard to start the kimchi varieties tofu potatoes ribs just so good it has taken me a few but i m back to finish this up sides are never ending always a bonus when they are good i feel like this is an anticlimactic end but i am very satisfied this is definitely a bring someone back place ,1
the food is excellent highly recommend the dolsot bibimbop prices are a little steep 11 30 service isn t the greatest it was our first time at a korean restaurant so when we would try to ask questions they were short with us or would just walk away when the woman brought the sides out we asked what they were and the woman as she was walking away said sides we knew that we wanted to know what each one was so when she walked back by i stopped her and asked what was in each one and she just did not want to tell us i finally just asked if any had fish since i don t like fish and was told one did but i would still go back because the food is that good ,1
my husband and i love korean food so we are always on the lookout for a good authentic korean restaurant because we travel to nashville several times a year we asked around and were directed to korea house the first thing i noticed when walking into the small restaurant was the amount of korean people having dinner good sign if you are looking for authentic korean food second thing i noticed was how well worn everything was in a nice homey way another good sign to me we ordered bulgogi one chicken one beef and dolsot bibimbap the food is amazingly good so flavorful and spicy the sides were great i especially love the kimchi and the bean sprouts our server mixed the bibimbap for us and it was perfect we will continue to frequent korea house whenever we are in nashville as the food is great on a side note the first time we visited the server we had a young woman was not very nice she was almost hostile for some reason we ordered three meals so we could share a little of each and take the rest back with us to eat over the next couple of days unless my teen son gets hungry then it is one meal she had the nerve to look at us and say that s a lot of food and just stood there so what we were paying for it so why the concern the second time our server was an older woman and she was awesome couldn t have asked for a better sever she sealed the deal for us as we had planned to look elsewhere if the service had been as poor as it had been the first time she brought us boxes for our leftover food and didn t bat an eye when we ordered three meals ,1
service is so bad here go to hai woon dai instead first of all the food here is very good but i live 90 miles away and this is the 2nd time in a row i ve been turned away i called ahead since i was running behind and they said be there by 9 30 and it would be okay i arrived at 9 20 and the owner still turned me away the previous time i waited in line til 9 30 but was turned away even though i arrived at 9 00 i will not be back again from now on i will go to hai woon dai where the food is just slightly less quality than that at korea house imo but the hospitality at hai woon dai is worlds better they remember me each time and i only eat at hai woon dai a few times per year ,0
we used to live in los angeles frequenting local korean restaurants for some of the most delicious food on earth after escaping to tennessee we realized how much we missed that authentic korean flavor it had been years since bulgogi or bibimbap had delighted my languishing tastebuds that is until the day a friend mentioned korea house it was exactly what we needed yes it s a cramped but the food was great and at the right price we ll be visiting again very soon ,1
went here with a friend my tab was 18 hers was 29 so we split the tab and he has me rung up as 18 and then when i hand him my card he quickly adds to it to make it 29 and then changes my friend s to 18 so quickly you wouldn t even know it without saying a word these people are rude if not criminal i let it go as a mistake but it s grown on me i felt the need to put in a negative review it s upset me so much it s old korean man who works there at the register i should have refused but it s only 10 but the more i think about it the more angry i become because he did it so purposely and so blatantly and then of course doesn t understand english i do not recommend this was practically criminal the food was okay the younger woman is nice there s some old lady probably the man s wife who came up without saying a word and just flung the food down on the table do not recommend do not come here and pay with credit card this sleezeball will quickly pull a bait and switch and pass it off as not being able to understand english scum ,0
very good compact setting with ample portions unique tastes seemed to be very popular with locals,1
three of us had lunch and even though we only ordered two main courses we had way too much food we started with fried pork dumplings and a seafood pancake which were very good the seafood pancake was closer to a pizza than a pancake because it had so much seafood in it it was better after the waitress suggested putting soy sause on it we forgot that they put out complimentary appetizers and that is why we had too much food there were about six small plates with different things really liked the potato the fish and stayed away from the kimchi its too hot for us my daugter ordered a beef dish and i ordered the chicken fried rice i did t try hers but she liked it and i liked my dish i definitely would recommend giving this restaurant a try ,1
been to lots of korean places this is always favorite friends has the same experience as me after they move they even came back for the restaurant took one star off only cuz there s no enough spaces for large groups ,1
authentic food if you love korean food this is the place for you good selection of sides cozy and friendly ,1
not bad for a small town k food would prefer more choices other than red hot spicy broths for my child but can t complain ,1
the inside does not look like much but the food is excellent we had various korean entrees and side dishes and all were well prepared tasty and filling these guys give a lot of food so go hungry if you like korean food then you should go to korea house in nashville ,1
the food tastes like at home delicious and sincere there are relatively large number of side dishes we could also find selections that are not normally offered in a typical korean restaurant the owner is very friendly it is a cozy and humble little place with very good food at reasonable price ,1
it s the place you always come with friends and super crowded at weekend s night i recently started liking the food here because actually there are not too many choices but they do have good food if you know what to order ,1
i am a regular visitor to the restaurant usually at least one time in a week the food is awesome parking is easy price is very reasonable they also take amex which is rare for an asian restaurant this size my favorite dishes are 19 and 26 cannot have enough ,1
i have eaten at korea house many times over that few years and it consistently provides excellent food and service ive eaten in korean restaurants nationwide and kh is right up there for food quality and value the only down sides are its location a strip mall way on the west side of the county and the decor strip mall chinese with korean signage but where it really counts food and service kh delivers ,1
if you are coming to nashville tn and you want real korean food meaning it is made by a wonderful korean family that will make you smile each time you see them than you need to go to korea house it is a little restaurant off of the beaten path of the tourist area but not far from the great shopping you will find at nashville west the best thing to do is order two or three meals and share them with all who are at your table ,1
my fiancee is a korean the first restaurant he brought me when i visited korea is this restaurant the taste of traditional food is great and fresh the waiter is nice ,1
you guys seriously korean is one of my all time favorite types of food to eat a bulgogi bi bim bop is home cooking to me and i am not by any stretch of the imagination korean i ve had bad korean food and am not universally accepting of the genre this is not bad korean food this is seriously delicious korean food the ban chan are like little gems set in front of you to sample and enhance your meal and they make their own kimchi too it s perfect on the hot sour meter as far as i m concerned the only thing this place does not have which i wouldn t expect them to that i miss are soju cocktails if you ve had soju cocktails with the easy pour spout and the deceptively tiny glasses you know what i mean otherwise love these welcoming happy people and the food they make ,1
a hidden gem in nashville and a place for authentic korean food we were visiting for the week and found this place on yelp bulgogi was tender and juicy beef barbecue cooked with onions and scallions and eaten with white rice the bibimbop is a dish with pickled carrots radishes lettuce barbecue beef egg mushrooms bean sprouts and a hot and sweet sauce it was beautiful and delicious the seafood pancake pajon was really good thick aromatic crispy with a tangy sauce and small pieces of shrimp and squid in the pancake the soondubujige a seafood stew was gobbled up by the family all the dishes are served with small side dishes including kimchee bean sprouts tempura omelettes radishes and cucumbers definitely recommend this place ,1
we love korea house we have been going there for years and have never been disappointed we lived for two years in korea and the food at korea house is better than we got there we always get the fried dumplins wonderful and gone in a flash then we order the bulgoggi it comes with lots of little side dishes you put the meat on a lettuce leaf add the red sauce some steamed rice and shredded radish yum this is the national dish of korean and it is great then we also get kimchee fried rice spicy and tasty and chop cha this is a noodle dish that has meat and veggies it is lots of food but you will want to taste it all and if there is any left take it home for later everyone that we have taken here loves it it is in a strip mall but you are not going for the atmosphere you are going for the food we drive 45 minutes to get there ,1
i agree with all the other reviews this is a great little restaurant in nashville super friendly service and delicious food overall a fantastic experience we ll definitely become regulars ,1
as far as a mom and pop ethnic restaurant goes this is at the highest level having spent a year in korea during service in the army many years ago it was a delight to discover this unassuming yet eminently satisfying korean restaurant the kimchis are excellent the chicken bulgogi delicious and amazingly the kimchi fried rice is outstanding ,1
eaten there often service good food anything is great ,1
my son and aughter in law were stationed in korea and they think that this place has the most authrentic food they have ever tasted outside of korea i know nothing about korean food but the three dishes that we had were delicious and i loved the little dishes of relish that you get before the meal our waitress was delightful the next time that i visit nashville i will head immediately for this restaurant the food is healthful as well as yummy ,1
located in a little strip shopping area on charlotte pike in west nashville korea house turned out to be a nice surprise i live between middle tn and santa monica so i travel between the two areas a lot often driving i ve had a lot of korean in la and korea house rivals or exceeds many of the restaurants there the prices are reasonable and the service is good the decor is nothing special just good food i ve been there many times since my first visit and it is a place i m glad to take visitors or meetings ,0
our family loves asian food we finally got to try this awesome korean restaurant in huntsville alabama rachel was our server and she did an outstanding job three of bbn us enjoyed bibimbap and one enjoyed kimchi fried rice we enjoyed all of the delicious food there is plenty of parking and they were advertising a new menu we will return soon ,1
my husband and i stopped here for lunch while we were out running errands and we were delightfully surprised to have some really good korean food my husband served in korea during the vietnam era and he loves korean food so we always want to try korean restaurants this one is not much to look at and the tables could use tablecloths or even plastic covers but we truly enjoyed the box lunches we ordered there was a nice variety and even the white rice was tasty we will definitely be going back ,1
we took 24 friends there last night and they handled us with no time delay food was great and a lot of the friends it was the first time for korean food and they liked it the onion pan cake was a hit with all ,1
i had never eaten korean food before and had tons of questions for the staff including what was in their marinades it turns out that they are made in house with ingredients such as sesame oil and soy sauce and what all the different pickles and condiments were everyone was very patient answering my questions and when the food arrived wow it was delicious i got the bibimbap with the marinated beef in a sizzling hot bowl soooo good i highly recommend this restaurant ,1
the food is great here the staff members are always super friendly the bulgogi and bibimbap are our favorites highly recommend this restaurant ,1
the menu needs better descriptions 1st time customers do not understand dishes with just titles the staff seem to rush to explain the menu the kimchi was the best part of the meal service was slow and i had to ask for refills on my ice tea may or may not go back ,0
while the food is good to the taste the serving sizes are comical they are very stingy with serving size also if i dine in for lunch and get the lunch plate you get 3 sides but if get a lunch plate to go you only get 2 sides and again the portion size is not enough to have for the entire meal sides should be the same regardless to whether i dine in or take out also yesterday 14 mar 19 i ordered a plate to go and asked how much for a side of reddish and the size because the last time i got the little plastic condiment size container for my sides so i wanted to know if i paid for extra what size would it be i was told the ounce size it was no waiter tried to compensate by saying he filled the container to full for me well duh why should it not be full especially as small as it was not my ounce for the price i fully intend to speak to management my next visit times are too hard for us to pay for such small portions we expect and demand better from american style establishments and all should be held to the same standard unacceptable i love korea needs to revamp their portion sizes and to go orders ,1
if you have been to korea or just enjoy the food this is a great place to get your fix food is very authentic service was good good place for family or couples reasonably priced ,1
we drive 85 plus miles quarterly to eat here and go shopping the atmosphere is friendly there is a sushi and beverage bar with a large screen television just in case alabama is playing roll tide the miso soup is very fine followed by fried dumplings and bulgulgi kimbob california roll bulgulgi platter with rice kimchi s and go chi jung spicy bean paste if this place was next door to me i would eat here five or more times a week yum special note to us the food tastes the best with ice water to drink not to cover the exotic flavors of the cuisine yum yum ,1
i was out for lunch and decided i wanted sushi i thought about places nearby that served sushi and decided on i love korea i had not been there recently so i was unaware if any changes had been made as i entered the parking lot i noticed that the main business sign still prominently displayed sushi bar i went in and was immediately seated as there were not many customers i was given a menu and no sushi was on it i asked a server and was told they did not do sushi anymore as it was lunch i did not have time to go elsewhere so i ordered a spicy chicken box the chicken was passable but i ve had much better at other korean or vietnamese restaurants in town the accompanying dishes were for the most part not very good no sauce was served with the stuffed dumpling as you usually see service was okay but nothing was making up for the false advertising and mediocre food you can get much better korean at a better lunch price at several places in huntsville as i left i took another look at the sign to make sure i wasn t crazy nope it still said sushi bar ,0
one of my favorite local restaurants in one of my favorite cities i love korea in huntsville alabama is conveniently located on jordan lane it s clean and the staff is friendly everyone is treated to a complimentary bowl of miso soup and my go to here is the spicy pork bibimbap along with the delicious kimchi i have never been disappointed with a meal here and can highly recommend it ,1
first visit to a korean restaurant i loved the chicken bibimbap whatever the korean name recipe cooked in a hot stoneware bowl but i was not very impressed with the kimchi it was not very tasteful i was hoping it to be quite spicy hot as i ve heard people talk about kimchi so ,0
a group of us meet at i love korea monthly the korean women in our group know what to order so i m never disappointed they have a kimchi made from korea radishes that is amazing they also have numerous other kimchis but you need to know what to ask for this isn t the most helpful review other than to say it s delicious ,1
i usually don t go to korean restaurants since i have it at home occasionally i went out to eat with a friend we randomly chose to go to i love korea i was not expecting much at first we were greeted by a friendly waitress service was great overall i decided to try kalbi and it was great it had a very authentic taste and side dishes that came with it were delightful i am a regular at this restaurant now and would recommend this place to anyone looking to try korean food ,1
tried korean food for the first time here and i loved it everything was so flavorful and fresh i usually try to stay away from beef when eating out but the meat in my bulgogi bimbimbap was cooked to perfection at i love korea ,1
first great service i went there for dinner was fairly early but bulgogi was leftover from lunch the meat was precooked too salty and tasted like chucks of something burnt rice was good miso soup was good fried pot stickers were good pan chan kimchi was good thinly sliced vinegar radish were good other stuff were not maybe depends on what you order here and it was my first time here but will not give it another chance disappointed with the meat ,0
so a co worker invited me to lunch for my birthday i went online saw great reviews and the menu and decided i d try the bimbimbap the waiter however suggested that as a first timer i might want to try the lunch box though both are crowd pleasers i went with his suggestion and wasn t unhappy i got the bugogli beef lunch box my co worker got the chicken wing box with a side of beef unsure why my co worker could get the chicken wing box with a side of beef when i couldn t get the beef box with a side of chicken was the same food but what i got was really tasty and flavorful the beef could ve been a bit more hot semi luke warm but still not bad we got there when they opened at 11 and within 20minutes the place was nearly packed i wasn t too happy with the dumplings they had somewhat of an odd after taste but my co worker says he liked them ,0
we normally enjoy korean food and once upon a time enjoyed this restaurant but now the food is unsavory even the rice and tea taste bad and the place is tired and a bit grubby ,0
this is probably the best korean restaurant in huntsville which says more about huntsville than it does about this restaurant the food is authentically korean spicy hot the menu is simple too many korean restaurants try to have chinese japenese or american food so come here if korean food is what you crave just a note it was friday evening and the place was empty ,1
the two of us ate lunch at i love korea the food was excellent in quantity and very good quality although it could have been spicier the service was efficient and friendly the atmosphere is a bit dark and dreary the overall value was very good we would return ,1
as the title says i love korea friendly employees and great food and service i love korea is an excellent choice for lunch this wasn t my first visit and won t be my last ,1
came at lunchtime i ordered the bugulgi bibimbop my goto standby korean dish off the lunch menu lunch menu has a varied selection of dishes for 9 99 btw food was good and service was excellent crowd inside wasn t too bad but parking was limited bill after food and drink tax and tip came to less than 15 00,1
i am very familiar with korean food and korea house was one of my all time favorite restaurants for korean food imagine my disappointment when i returned to huntsville to visit my folks and found it had closed they had the absolute best korean buffet i have ever had this week i am at home again visiting and i noticed this new korean restaurant i love korea it is right across the street from the original korea house i had the chicken bibimbop in the stone pot and it was excellent it came out sizzling hot from the kitchen and the miso soup is some of the best i ve had the side dishes were three kinds of kimche fishcakes and noodles but were tiny portions which could have been a bit larger i feel my mother had the chicken terriyaki and that was awesome too i would come back here but will always miss korea house ,1
great korean food fresh ingredients and wonderful flavors the outside of the building may not look the greatest but this place is truly fantastic ,1
we love korean food we visited this place while in a business trip unlike at home clarksville tn they only gave 6 side dishes which isn t so bad but the portions we very small then they didn t seem to want to give refills on the sides we had to ask the gal bi was too salty and not as tender as we are use to the champong was a bit too oily but had a pretty good flavor the spicy pork california rolls were very good the server was nice except for the fact that he didn t come to check on us for refills of sides over all if it s the only korean place in town i ll go back for another visit maybe dr mac,0
after looking at their menu and hearing from others how great this place is my husband and i decided to try it for lunch when we walked in we were greeted immediately and seated in the party section in the back they were very busy so this didn t bother us at all we were just happy to get a seat that fast we looked at the menu and our waiter was taking our order in less than 2 minutes i ordered the bulgogi lunch box and my husband ordered the rice dish with bulgogi and a fried egg on top i don t remember exactly what it was called we received our miso soup and then our little side dishes of kimchi radish etc very quickly the food was great the soup was served hot with the little tofu pieces and the side dishes were exactly what we expected when i received my lunch box i was impressed because it looked and smelled amazing my husband received his food about 3 4 minutes later because we didn t receive our food at the same time we never got a check to go pay we had to relay what we ordered to the cashier at the front and also because the women next to us ordered some soup that smelled so bad like hot blue cheese that it was very hard to continue to eat our lunch without getting sick i ve decided to give them 4 stars instead of 5 the service and food was great so we will return and i do highly recommend i love korea for great food for a great price hopefully when we do return no one will order that horrible soup again yuck ,1
i ve been here several times and i m a big fan i ve never been to korea so i m far from an expert on korean food but this restaurant is clean the staff is friendly professional there are many options and the meals i ve had have been excellent give i love korea a try you won t be disappointed and you ll be supporting local small business ,1
it was a nice surprise to find an authentic korean food place in huntsville and it was pretty yummy lots of good original foods to choose from the service was nice the place was clean and plenty of parking prices were pretty reasonable as well ,1
try the bulgogi bbq beef bimbimbap stone pot rice the tofu chigae the jampon spicy seafood noodles you will love the little dishes they serve for free too warning you will not want to come here on a low carb day cuz you gotta eat the rice ,1
lunch box is my favor but today i give a chance to try something else the onion cake it was really good short ribs is my favor wife plate always got it for lunch if u love spicy try the hot sauce they have,1
only the second time i have eaten korean food it was very delicious and the food came out attractive and fast the bibbabi box was great ,1
if you like korean food you ve got to try thier bulgogi bibmibap served in a hot stone bowl comes to the table still sizzling white rice on bottom with veges and sunny side up fried egg on top reasonable price of 10 99 with all the side dishes besure to add some kimchi to your bowl of bibimbap husband had fried rice with chicken everything was great even the red sauce was good only complaint was the stone bowl kept the food almost to hot to eat will definitly be back,1
a friend and i recently stopped in to have lunch at this very popular korean restaurant we arrived at 11 45 for an early lunch and it was packed trying to find a parking spot was a challenge service was understandably slow but the food was very good and worth the long wait i had the spicy chicken in lettuce wraps plus the obligatory sides including a very good kimchi pickled daikon fish cake not so good spicy cucumbers and something with cellophane noodles and slivers of carrots the food was we ll cooked moderately spicy and delicious ,1
my wife and i went here last night the food was very good i had the kalitang and my wife had the bulgogi i recommend getting the bulgogi it is delicious ,1
the food was amazing and the service was fantastic even though we are not staying in huntsville very long i want to go back to eat here again i will miss this food when i go home ,1
food was really good prices was reasonable menu had wide variety service was fast and friendly it s now a favorite for us definitely worth the 45 minutes trip for us to get there if you like korean food give them a try ,1
champong they have that and a bunch of other authentic korean dishes just go check it out you won t regret it of course they have their range of regular korean bbqs but their selection of noodles and tofu was great highly recommend ,1
i stopped to get some for supper and once back in the car had to drive 25 miles with the best smells in my car i wanted to stop and eat along the way but that would not have been fair to the ones waiting at home it was so good love this place ,1
we love this place i was in south korea and this good reminds me of my stay in korea beautiful land and awesome people and food to die for ,1
i atelunch at this restaurant for the first time today and it was great we had the bulgogi and spicy port bibimbap miso soup and it was all delicious they brought a half dozen side vegetable dishes of kimchi and tofu mixes service was excellent lunch dishes were 10 each and well worth it can t wait to go back ,1
i have spent several yeas in korea and have eaten a variety of dishes from many locations in south korea i found the offerings at this restaraunt to be very authentic and reasonably priced the kimbap served there is as good as i have had i especially enjoy the kalbi ribs htye are not my favorite in huntsville but a very close second at a significantly reduced cost compared to the other korean plae two blocks away the servers are well trained and helpful all in all this is my go to place for korean food in huntsville and i favorably compare their offerings to many places i have dined at in korea and better than quite a few over there ,1
we drive 45 min to get to this place as often as we can the bulgogi bibimbap is the best love the cucumber kimchi ,1
i ve enjoyed korean food for over 30 years i started eating it in hawaii and lived in korea for two years i ve had korean food in at least 3 countries i don t consider myself an expert but pretty well versed i love korea is very good i would like to eat there once or twice a week ,1
i understand that i love korea is owned by the same people that own korea house currently closed i love korea has very good sushi but the made to order meals are not as good to me as the buffet at korea house at the times i visited in 2013 the sushi is a good value but the lunch menu is a bit pricey for me especially if i order a side of sushi if i recall correctly lunch with a side order of sushi was around 16 and that is with a water tip not included i have been back and just had the sushi a couple of times and it is always sooo gooood and fresh ,1
traveling through huntsville my sister and decided to use tripadvisor for a korean rest we choose i love korea being there are three close to each other we ordered kimbop freshly rolled onion pancake huge bulgogi yakimondo can i say oh my goodness the portions were great for the price the rest is clean and spacious for large groups the food was made with love i am a lover of korean food due to a neighbor i had once was korean this food makes me miss my friend suk j if you eat here you will not be disappointed you will most likely have some food to take home and enjoy later i will pass through again and it will only be i korea ,1
i am always looking for good sushi i found this one by word of mouth and must say they know sushi the building used to be a japanese restaurant the outside although a bit rough opens up to a nice interior where you feel welcome there is a sushi bar at the front and we opted for that as i was a guest of another korean friend the selections were traditional but the presentation was spot on portions seemed larger than your typical restaurant and the chef was desirous to show us his work we had about 11 varieties each was well done i left full there is a mizo soup to start you off while you wait but the wait was not long at all staff was helpful and attentive i did not get to sample their other meal options but will be back to do so i can only give 4 stars till i try the rest dinner time is great time to go as there were open seats but over half full on the night we visited ,1
we ve eaten at three korean restaurants here in huntsville and by far this one was the best directly across the street from korea house another korean restaurant which we didn t really care for service was ok but food was not glad we came to i love korea ,1
first i certainly don t proclaim to be an expert on korean food my limited experience has been eating a friend s from south korea home cooked food which was excellent this food was decent but not as good as i ve had i thought the food was somewhat bland until i added a good amount of hot sauce very good waiter that was helpful in navigating the menu total bill for two meals 26 17 without the tip ,0
wow little hole in the wall with amazing food and super friendly service bulgogi and pajeon were as good as it gets and the kimchi beats anything i had in south korea ,1
this place as an amazing traditional bibimbap you can also ask the traditional bibimbap with tofu instead of meat if you are vegetarian beware of how spicy it is if you re not into spicy food though next time i will probably ask them to put a bit less but it s delicious anyway we also had the fried dumplings which were surprisingly tasty and the sauce was great order them and go eat there now i was there yesterday and i would honestly go again today ,1
i visit this restaurant regularly and they never disappoint the food is great the service is friendly and nice prices are standard i m a big fan of their bibimbap but the whole menu has its own merit recommend,1
the best korean restaurant in prague i like how all of the staff speak korean however the waiting time is too long much better for dinner than lunch ,0
went to bibimbap to try something different and it was a very nice experience the place was nice clean and cosy staff were very friendly and polite food had lots of flavor and portions were quite generous ,1
this little hole in the wall restaurant was around the corner from my bnb i was sick of all the meat in prague so opted to try some local ethnic korean cuisine this place did not disappoint food was spicy and delicious i recommend the dish 1 korean hot pot bibimbap on the menu but everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing if i get back to prague i will stop by again ,1
found this restaurant on tripadvisor and i was very optimistic sadly we ordered the salmon one of the most expensive things on the menu and when it came it hadn t been defrosted properly we also ordered the fried chicken and fried dumplings which were delicious and the black bean noodles which were below average overall the frozen salmon let the whole meal down but if that doesn t put you off i would definitely recommend the fried chicken and fried dumplings ,1
went there for dinner the staff was extremely friendly the food came with side dishes taste is very similar to what you can get in korea for a more than reasonable price highly recommended,1
we randomly stopped by during our stay and enjoyed the bibimbap and sweet and sour chicken soup that came with it was better than miso service was a bit slow but we managed i did appreciate that they offered tap water in a caraffe with several restaurants during our prague stay refused to offer ,1
look past the location and rough exterior as it is a very nice charming and cheap korean restaurant great value fantastic bibimbap tasted just like what i had in seoul ,1
me and my friends ate here a delicious korean meal we enjoyed it a lot and the prices were okay though not as low as other restaurants nearby 10 12 240 290 czk ,1
i ve been to this place many times alone and with family and friends this time i ordered kimchi chigae the soup didn t have a single decent piece of pork it used to have it was all bit and pieces one of the side dish had mayo which i couldn t eat common allergens ie eggs nuts are specified on menu which gimchi chigae has but not for the side dishes i couldn t change the dish if this had been told to me prior i would ask first whether i could change if not i d order something else i ended paying for something i couldn t eat also i ended up with gimbap without tuna despite ordering tuna gimbap on my first takeaway with the restaurant money wasted there the taste of the food is still good but other aspects has dropped quite a lot a bit here a bit there it s big when they are all accumulated ,0
we had a pleasant visit and meal at bibimbap food tasted amazing like my mother in law makes ofcourse some spiciness is lowered but it is completely not a minus kimchi was well aged and delicious was worth finding and visiting ,1
i often go to this place as it is just round the corner from my place it never disappoints the food is always good and just what i want the staff are always friendly,1
don t be fooled by the exterior of the building this place has really great food it s owned run by koreans and the bibimbap we ordered tasted just like the ones we ate in south korea lovely and polite staff highly recommended when you crave some delicious korean food ,1
the staff here is very nice and are more than willing to explain the dishes to those who are not familiar with korean cuisine most of the staff seemed to speak english so i would say they are also tourist friendly the place itself is nice enough some korean and korean themed decorations and the general atmosphere is calm and reserved pleasant for a peaceful and relaxing dinner the food is amazing it seems to be authentic and some dishes are very spicy hot but delicately seasoned the menu ranges from classic bibimbap and udon noodles to various gimgap and sweet potato noodles they also have some meals which can be shared with one or two other persons and they have sets so you can try various foods the price is fair for a dinner although i must say i wish they had a lunch menu too ,1
delicious asian food but you have to be careful with spicy dishes as they are really spicy good service ,1
stopped by here for our korean fix and were really happy bibimbap was delicious and service polite and fast the restaurant is nicely decorated despite being a basement style restaurant it didn t feel cramped at all busy but we didn t have any trouble turning up without a reservation after korean in prague check this place out ,1
the restaurant is literally a few meters away from the tram station but is not in plain view so you can easily miss it if you are not paying attention or if you don t know where to look the fact there are some stairs very near is also not helping however after you step in you realize that the inside is quite big and quite nice the setting is very pleasing and the decor is retaining the korean motives in clean modern lines we didn t know what to expect with respect to the food when we entered in and we can not certify if is authentic korean food what we can say that it tasted very good the service was also nice no personal touch but fast and professional we noticed near by a family with a small baby and they had a high chair overall a great find in prague we will probably return p s if is a weekend is better to make a reservation ,1
we visited this korean restaurant as per recommendation and noticing that it was very close to our accommodation we didn t book in advance as it was only a thursday evening but upon arrival we considered ourselves lucky as we managed to get one of the last tables there was a wide range of dishes on offer predominantly different variations of bibimbap dishes but many others too i ordered the bulgogi bibimbap number 2 on the menu and my boyfriend ordered the jeyuk bokeum bap number 8 both dishes were served with a side of kimchi and my bulgogi bibimbap also came with a clear soup both dishes were extremely tasty and my boyfriend even joked about asking for the recipe as it was that good and he wanted us to make it back at home the service was very prompt and the prices reasonably cheap we paid around 500kc with a tip from what i can remember would highly recommend ,1
prompt service good food in the center of prague if you like asian food you will probably enjoy this place ,1
the best korean restaurant in prague very authentic and super tasty if you like spicy do not wait a second longer ,1
i arrived after a morning of sight seeing they we re courteous and helpful i made mistakes with overpaying and they gave change back i mispronounced the order and they made sure it was i really wanted to order yummy food ,1
we went for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it we got the bibimbap a fried rice dish a trio of side dishes and 2 cokes for 20 the food was delicious and highly recommend it ,1
wasn t quite sure what to expect when i was walking in however the food was amazing if i dad a friend that was korean and they took me to their mums house i would expect it might be like this pure comfort food ,0
i mean the street is filled with plenty of better restaurants that are cheaper than this place the food isn t bad but it sure isn t authentic either my noodles were served with rice and the bibimbap reminded me more of a salad than a rice dish ,1
enjoyable experience we tried several korean dishes slightly higher waiting time because of prime hours but worthy ,1
we were craving korean food on our last night in prague and after a google search found this gem while it required me to take a 12 minute tram ride on the 15 or 26 it was worth the ride and nice to see a more neighborhood like part of prague compared to the flat i am staying in city center they accept visa and they do carry out i took our food to go and while i had to wait about 15 minutes for our food i imagine that had i called in my order it would have been ready when i got there in a city not known for strong customer service they accommodated my requests for sauce on the side for one dish and less spicy on my daughter s both the owner and the staff were kind patient and help the food tasted fresh and great and there was a lot of it we probably could have split a dish worth the trip ,1
so good they only have two types of dishes spicy and non spicy and if they say spicy they mean it the korean spicy red pesto is amazing and will make you sweat in the beginning and regret your choices at the end d in the best possible way my personal favourite is the meal no 3 the fried meat with rice and spicy korean pesto on the bed of lettuces so good coming back for it all the time d ,1
really good bibimbap it was a little bit too spicy for us but the beer saved our tongues staff was okay,1
we found this place online there was wide variety of food with quality loved that there was kimchi with every of our dishes it was very tasty i had the bibimbap and it was very overwhelming a lot of food you pay and get a really good sized portion the waitress was kind and helpful loved that there was kpop playing in the background very welcoming to any type of person ,1
we ordered 1 starter and main dish for two person all the food came the same time we ordered sweet and sour pork it was deep fried and not any mension in the menu we sayd it does not look the same in the list they did not care that at all can not recommend this place at all ,0
this is one of the best things about tripadvisor using the app can help you locate places you would ve never thought of trying out bibimbap has good service nice environment and great food there i tried korean food for the first time and i will definitely try it again to see if it is as good at bibimbap i had the no 1 on the menu which is said to be a traditional korean dish it was spicy and tasty for a very good price ,1
tasty spicy food good alternative for local czech restaurants well worth a visit inexpensive like every other restaurant in prague 3 ,1
the authentic bibimbap which is supposed to be served in a claypot and egg wasn t served instead we were being served something sort of a salad rice it is not like the one we have eaten back home we wish that this restaurant can serve true bibimbap as stated no matter the other food here are splendid ,1
do not recommend we ordered a vegetarian bibimbap they gave us 1st time a bibimbap with meat so we told the waitress and she said sorry sorry 2 min after we got another bibimbap expecting a vegetarian one this time after 2 or 3 layers we realized there was meat again inside this one so they probably used the 1st one to redo a vegetarian one very disappointed not recommend this place ,0
we both had the chicken bibimbap which was really tasty served with lots of leaves and generous portion of chicken the chicken was slightly dry but it is served with plenty of very spicy sauce which makes up for it also served with a small bowl of broth which was delicious the service was surprisingly good by prague standards and the serving staff were helpful in recommending a local bar nearby ,1
bibimbap korea is the best restaurant in prague for many reasons what i liked 1 the food is just so good and reasonably priced you get authentic korean food i was told by friends who lived in korea it s well prepared and presented 2 the service is very good i was impressed with the waitresses they are kind respectful speak english three characteristics that are hard to find in prague sorry to say that they don t have customer service skills here i was personally served by a blonde one i m sorry i don t know her name despite i ordered something but i meant something else she immediately went to the kitchen and got me what i wanted literally in 5 minutes thank you so much 3 restaurant is nice good atmosphere clean 4 owners are really nice i had the chance to have a chat with the owner a korean woman who is really nice 4 you can pay by card what i didn t like i actually never had any negative experience there i ve been three times so far ,1
we went out of our way to try this place and i m glad we did it s off the beaten path and by no means a fancy place so you can dress casual this is a value eat place really good food for a good price wouldn t recommend this place if you re not into korean food ,1
very good korean food best customer service i suggest to do reservation before you are coming here a lot of food spicy,1
a something different in a line of czech restaurants that i m really not a fan of cannot compare since this is a first korean place i visited but i left happy and full would recommend ,1
hello i just had dinner in this restaurant all was great till i found one hair in my food but the best part was when we paid and they charged me the dish where i found the hair which kind of restaurant is this one ,1
great korean food nice atmosphere and friendly staff members my husband and i were so happy that we went there so satisfying recommend to people who want to try real korean food with a reasonable price ,1
food is really really good portions are generous staff speaks english and are very nice and friendly recommended ,1
simple and centrally located place with good food and friendly staff english is not an issue and children are welcome,1
i have been to this restaurant 3 times both for lunch and dinner and i was always satisfied with the quality of food the owners are very polite and so do the waiters in the afternoon time there might be a longer waiting time ,1
as someone said for prague where the food is quite mediocre this place gets a four while in la it will probably get a three the fact that the owners are korean does not make the place korean the food was ok warm and generous but it was not bibimbap korean we ate the service was ok place looked ok clean though you step out smelling like the cook as i said being that you are in prague this place is a good place to eat ,0
this restaurant was our biggest surprise nice was super nice the place is cozy and the food amazing that brought back all of our memories from seoul i was super happy because they are making hotteok as well what is a little bit pricey compared to seoul but the taste just worth is plus if you are vegetarian you can ask any food without meet ,1
dont be fooled by the look we thought it was closed but once you enter you wont regret it the food is fantastic real authentic korean affordable and worth a visit will definetly come back if we re ever in prague again ,1
i ve been coming back to bibimbap semi regularly for a while their prices have gone up a little bit but are still lower than in other korean restaurants in prague the place has become very popular particularly at dinner time so make sure to book a table the food is delicious the service is great vegetarian options are available awesome place ,1
great authentic bibimbap in prague so glad we found this place as we needed a change from the european food very cheap too we were staying in old town so it was a 30 min walk probably the only downside to this restaurant ,1
the food was super nice and the staff was very helpful the portions are very big and only 170 240 crowns 6 5 to 10 they have several tables in different little rooms so it feels very intimate i loved it totally worth it ,1
i came here to eat after a quick look on here there was a 30 minute wait but the place was packed and there were others waiting so i knew it must be good koreans and locals ate here too my meal was very delicious and what i guess home cooked korean food would taste like it is very advisable to book a table ahead of visiting,1
we were incredibly lucky to have this by our apartment fully recommend you check this place out check out the photo service amazing food next level so cheap too short and sweet review we both left extremely happy big tip left ,1
we found this place with trip advisor and it was amazing the dishes were great i loved the beef and the people were so heart warming it was a wonderful evening ,1
the food is amazing makes you feel at soul _ and the owners are very nice and helpful as well as the staff highly recommended good food great service nice atmosphere _ ,1
if you re a korean kitchen lover or just willing to taste it you should visit this restaurant the food is very tasty but if you don t like spicy food pay attention to the menu cuz there s a lot of spicy dishes also the dishes are big and the price isn t so expensive if you re a spicy lover i recommend to try the dish named kimchi chigae ,1
exellent food big portions and good service would come here again entrance door is not on the main street so look for the stairs to go down one level ,1
the food was excellent and the portions were large the prices were low the service was not top notch but i did not mind the food and the prices were so great ,1
fantastic food lovely service very well priced highly recommend if you are in the area and are looking for a filling meal the seafood broth with noodles is amazing ,1
great atmosphere tasty food and perfect location that is bibimbap place where you gonna feel like you are somewhere in asia great experience ,1
pretty nice food i got one of those boxes with several different dishes inside and absolutely enjoyed it ,1
not a frequent korean eater so not much reference material but this was excellent food for a great price ,1
everything you want of korean food is here lots of choices and prices are affordable good place for lunch ,1
just had an incredible bibimbap and a soup for starter reasonably spicy and very authentic the broth only is worth dying for very friendly staff go there try it ,1
very solid korean food super friendly staff unassuming atmosphere only problem is the rather long wait for the food to arrive highly recommended nonetheless ,1
good place cheap and tasty food been there 2 times so good for that cash advise this restaurant ,1
down to earth ambience very friendly staff not that i m an expert on korean cuisine but i ve eaten bibimbap at least 10 times and also in some famous korean restaurants abroad and the food quality here is comparable and better than in most prague restaurants recommended ,1
a variety of korean kitchen excellent tasty food accessible by tram packed with locals inexpensive ,1
it was the first time we tried a korean restaurant and it was an excellent experience good and fast service friendly staff and exquisite food portions were big and the price was also really nice ,1
we ate there great korean dishes servings were big it was my first time with this type of cuisine and i m positively suprised although the place smells a little bit odd i think that the reason is bad air conditioning or lack of ventilation ,0
one of my favourite restaurants in prague all their dishes are amazing the classical bibimbap is just mindblowing and so tasty very good prices as well ,1
we came here based on the good reviews and were not disappointed they do put a good deal of sririacha on a couple of the dishes so if you don t like that sauce you might mention to hold that good ground beef with kimchi ,1
food 3 service 1 very slow service when i came in service were sitting with ice cream they didn t care about customers at all,0
i used to travel a lot to korea in the past so i miss korean food now this restaurant a nice place with excellent couisine and extremely kind service brought my memory back to the old days of my travelling to this country so everything really really nice ,1
i d never eaten in a korean restaurant before and if other are to this standard then i will be doing so a lot more often it is a little tricky to find from the main road and you will need to book ahead of time but what a great experience,1
if you want to taste something different than avarage asian food available on every czech street you should definately go there it is the unique place in prague with delicious cuisine not only for asian food lovers but also for those who want to taste something new classic bibimbap bulgogi bap and udong are great they used to have ramen not sure if still available the must visit spot on zizkov ,1
great authentic korean dishes although the food took extremely long to be prepared we had a great meal and the prices are cheap highly recommend the fried chicken as the proportion was big and very delicious ,1
i rarely give 5 stars on tripadvisor but this place deserves it the food is really good the restaurant itself is simple but comfy and the waitresses are making sure that you re comfortable and well served it was one my first times eating korean but i really liked their main dish with a side of fish soup bill for the main course and a beer 220 czk will definitely go back ,1
as soon as i arrived to prague went to tripadvisor to have a look what was being offered as a cheap eats and surprisingly i found this restaurant on this category which made me go for it without even seeing the following options as i love korean food the bibimbap and the 2 soups were simply excelent ,1
let me start of with that i eat authentic asian food at home everyday and that i am quite picky i travel quite a bit and it s hard to find this good authentic korean food in europe the noodle soup starters and seafood pancake haemul pajeon was extremely good we ended up ordering more than we could eat just because it was good and we left very satisfied and i wish my wife would have allowed me to tip even more than i did thank you for a great meal ,1
as a native korean on a visit this hit the spot prices are excellent but more importantly the food was just like how mom makes it soon dubu kimchi jjigae bulgogi and bibimbap were all good plus the kimchi was nice and spicy you will find this restaurant on an awkward corner of a block in prague 3 about a 10 minute uber ride or 40 minute walk from prague 1 after eating goulash for a couple days our group craved some spices thanks bibimbap korea ,1
my standards are very high when it comes to korean food my aunt chong s family in seoul owns one of the most successful korean restaurants and my aunt can cook i am very spoiled on korean food as i grew up eating it i have tried korean food all over europe but this place beats them hands down there is a fantastic korean place in dresden that is impressive and they do things the old school way cook your own meat on the center of the table if you desire however if you are wishing to have excellent korean food in prague this is hands down the absolute very best sample everything you can as you will not go wrong ,1
 the food is delicious kind and polite waitress small place with a lot of table but it is enjoyable when it is not full recommended to make a reservation,1
we decided to check this place out having seen all the amazing reviews on tripadvisor and we were certainly not disappointed the restaurant is a little out of the way but worth the way it is just off of the street you get off the tram and down some steps inside is nothing special but the service is great and friendly and it was reasonably quiet the night we went we hadn t eaten korean before so didn t know what to expect we tried korean ginger tea which was delicious and then my partner had the tradition soup to start followed by a tray of pork and rice etc it looked amazing i had a ramen type bowl and some sushi which were both great and plentiful the price is amazing and the food is a of a high standard thoroughly enjoyed it ,1
we found this restaurant on trip advisor while searching for some new place to go for a dinner the good reviews do not lie food is very delicious and you will have problems to finish it as the amount is pretty generous worth to try out ,1
we love to visit this place easily accessible from the centre and delicious bibimbap leaves without regrets great beer and rice wine too ,1
i brought here many friends and everyone loved it it s owned by an older korean couple who is usually at the spot helping their staff tried a few of their meals but every time i get back to bibimbap the classic although they increased prices recently it s still good value for money i recommend to book a table a day in advance in the evenings it s almost impossible to find a free table prior booking the amount of korean people there also confirm its authenticity ,1
i was never a big fan of korean cusine but bibimbap made a differance to my taste i even visited the place twice in three days size of the portion is just perfect and the used ingridents were just right proces are so resonable the speciality dish was bibimbab ,1
saturday evening and we had no reservation but still tried our luck we had to share out table but it was no problem food was really good and it came quickly prices are very affordable strong recommendation ,1
i had planned to visit bibimbap based on the positive reviews and was not disappointed visited last monday feb 13th arrived at 2pm without booking and found a table very good fresh food cooked served well judging by the amount of korean asian customers on the day we visited i feel it must me authentic i had the seafood noodles and was not disappointed my friend had the spicy work and wanted to order some for take away as well if you are in prague and want something different this must be on your list ,1
fantastic place to eat our korean dishes they offer various kinds of the stuff that is both very tasty and also looks great definitely recommended ,1
my favorite korean place in prague the food is good it s not too far from the centrum and the prices are average i ve been going here since they were still a smaller shop in karlin and their menu has expanded since but still delicious generally i go for the kimchi fried rice or the spicy pork when i m alone but the seafood pancake and the chicken kkanpunggi is really good to share the owners are also really friendly ,1
i wouldn t say the bibimbap was the most authentic ones we had tried before but overall the food was actually quite delicious we went for dinner without reservation and didn t have to wait long for a table despite the place was quite packed service was good and the price was reasonable ,1
visitors with friend saw many koreans coming for dinner that was a good sign food was perfect and prices very friendly ,1
not everything mix with korean spicy sauce is bibimbap rice meat mix with raw vegetables salad i wonder if the owner or the chef ever tried or seen korean bibimbap or not lol okay restaurant environment was nice service okay at least already better than other restaurants can t expect much of prague service ,0
i we have visited the place twice in the past month one was a quick lunch the place does not offer any special lunch menu and the other was what was to be a decent birthday celebration food is great in terms of its variety authenticity and freshness other reviews testify to this show you pics etc so no need to delve in detail on this the service is however problematic the lunch experience was below average service wise in terms of attentiveness etc but since the place was pretty empty it was bearable however the birthday celebration on friday night occassion with a place having being completely packed revealed and amplified this general problem the staff was very nervous as a line of guests waited inside and outside the restaurant demanding to be seated afyer being seated i had to leave the table three times first to ask for the menu card after 20 minutes waiting and not seeing anyone to come and say even hello second to ask where our soup was after another 30 mins of nothing happening after i brought a waiter with me to the table and third the same with our main course somehow not making it to our table again after 30mins with soup balls still on table next tables were not served any better but the international crowd of youngsters seemed to be patient if dissatisfied too additionally the right side of the restaurant was very cold and we kept our winter jacket on at times bottom line i will give it a third chance as we live nearby but if the service is not substantially improved i will go elsewhere then there is another jap korean restaurant nearby wont identify not to be blamed for favouring it which albeit more expensive provides top service ,0
great authentic food for reasonable price very nice and efficient service which speaks english free wifi ,1
i had a fantastic experience here though i d recommend booking in advance we had to wait for a table for three but nothing extreme only 20mins or so the menu has pictures if you re unsure of what to order and the food was delicious would highly recommend and would definitely visit again ,1
bibimbap korea is valuable korean restaurant in europe it serves original korean food and it is really amazing that i can eat real korean food here it is definitely different from other korean restaurant in other european countries i study in netherlands and i tried many already in other already but they are frequently poor however this place use fresh ingredients and think much about the food some of food was much better than korea if you are beginner of korean food try kimchi bok eum bap or bibimbap or dosirak menu i think cham ppong is one of the best dish here but it will be too spicy for beginner anyway i think most of the dishes here deserves the price you can see many foreigners and local people who is eating korean food when i visited here more than 90 were non korean and 70 were non asian if you have enough budget try this restaurant you won t regret oh and the servers can speak not only english but also korean quite well you can see servers are talking with korean owner in korean language it is also interesting experience ,1
friendly service great food and nice interior good food in big portions always recommended central location near city centre ,1
my boyfriend and i went to this restaurant twice when we were in prague both the food and the staffs are excellent the two owners are also really nice and helpful the first time we had fried pork with sweet sour sauce and chicken bibimbap and the second time we had bulgogi bibimbap with braised chicken with potato and carrot the restaurant is always full and it s quite small so make a reservation before you come ,1
with my boyfriend who is quite acquainted with korean cuisine we decided to give this place a try we ordered bibimbap and sundubu čigae and weren t disappointed at all the food was delicious the service friendly and really helpful it was nice as well that we could get some free tap water with our meal not that common in cz or at least with a lot of troubles korean people at the next tables were also a good sign recommend to everyone who likes this cuisine ,1
the food was delicious and the service was wonderful even if you dont eat it all you can take it home and eat it later it was a wonderful time ,1
the food in this place was incredible i have to say i can t remember exactly what we ate my partner had a nice chicken dish with korean sauce i had a platter box with pork and squid lots of other delicious things it was healthy but so tasty i would go back to prague just to visit this place probably the best meal i have ever had i will ask my partner what it was see if she remembers sake was nice too and for pudding we had the most beautiful small sweet pancake to share presentation to die for great thank you for the impeccable service relaxed and informal but spot on ,1
i am visiting this restaurant from the times it was placed in another address i don t know what to order in this place because i want eat everything ,1
went for saturday lunch really good food great english speaking service and reasonable prices will be coming back ,1
great small place with great food the place itself looks a bit dull but the food more than compensates for the humble surroundings ,1
we decided to visit this place cuz we like korean food this place is absolutely dull walls are white and empty light is very cold in whole restaurant and because of that u feel like in hospital they haven t got cloths hanger that s little bit uncomfortable we took ramen and bibimbap a with set of suchi ramen was big and very very hot noodles in it were very simple and without any special taste looked like the cheapest fast food noodles but it was spicy thanks for that bibimbap wasn t tasty at all we both didn t like it sushi were without any meet or fish just vegetable sushi but that were big and tasty very simple atmosphere 3 from 10 food 3 from 10 service 7 from 10,0
love their food so much every time we get a take out or a sit down it s the same great quality and the staff are super ,1
completely unexpected if you are looking for an authentic experience then look no further the prices are relatively low as well ,1
having lived in korea for over two years and being with a korean we were excited but a bit skeptical to find some korean food next to our place we went for lunch and ordered bibimbap pajeon and bulgogi kimbap the restaurant s signature dish was delicious on par with what you d find in korea flavorful authentic and chocked full of various fresh veggies we also appreciated that it wasn t served too hot our pajeon was solid nice and crispy on the outside and soft inside with delicious bits of green onion and squid the kimbap a staple of my diet when i lived in seoul was a bit of a letdown a tad bland and dry you can see why they didn t name the place kimbap the meal wasn t cheap but not prohibitively expensive either though i m used to paying less for similar dishes the biggest negative of the meal was the lack of side dishes as well as bland kimchi that seemed washed in attempt to downplay its natural spiciness for the european market i d definitely recommend but stick to the bibimbap ,1
probably the best korean you ll find in prague this place is very cheap for the quality of the food i d reccomend booking in advance if you plan on going on a friday or saturday night it gets very busy the menu is extensive and there is definitely something for everyone vegetarian options in abundance we had the beef and some fried chicken thing portions are massive after getting 3 dishes and 1 soup we couldn t finish it all would highly reccomend this place perfect for a good quality cheap eat ,1
very fresh healthy and tasty meals definitely a go go just be careful if you do not like it too spicy ,1
came here with some friends the services were great the food was really delicious however the time waiting for the meal to come up is really slow around 30min i would not recommed this to anyone with the rush of time ,1
we ve been going to this restaurant since it was located in karlín we are always touched to see the amazing job the owners have done during the past years their restaurant is growing and it s not only because of the excellent food it s the welcoming atmosphere there is one disadvantage for us we can t go there for dinner whenever we want anymore reservations have become needed i am sure the owners will keep the good job for a very long time and we are happy for them 3,0
this is the place to get the bibimbap in prague absolutely delicious with strong broth and fabulous kimchi don t even think about the other places offering the korean cuisine this is an absolute gem ,1
we went after reading the reviews and it didn t disappoint the waitress was supernice and to our surprise the quality was higher than what you expect for a 150ck plate beware of the spicyness definitely recommend we ll be going quite often ,1
got recommended this restaurant and was certainly not dissapointed no nonsense restaurant great tasty korean food the number of etnic korean customers was an extra assurance to us that this was a good choice rather plain decor thus maybe not the setting for the perfect romantic date but rather for casual lunch or dinner with friends or family or just by yourself fast service ,1
really tasty food and great service highly recommend had fried chicken sweet and spicy sauce to share as well as several sides ,1
i visited this restaurant with my dad both of us having on different occasions visited korea and loved the food and we were not disappointed the food was great and authentic the atmosphere is ok and the gentleman who served us the owner their waitress was off at the time was lovely and helpful the menu is limited but that s no fault it means that what you get is really fresh and delicious based on this i d rate it five star however just as most if not all korean or perhaps asian in general restaurants in prague the food contains msg and possibly quite considerable amounts if i had any suspicions they were confirmed by the sight of the familiar long crystals in the chilli powder mix that i was offered when asked for extra chillies i was disappointed by this and not surprised msg really is very common in countries like korea and it is almost impossible to get away from there so it s understandable you d find it here my guess is you d struggle to find korean restaurant in prague that avoids msg and this one is probably as good as it gets one recommendation to the restaurant get some fresh chillies or korean chilli sauces to offer those customers who want the real spicy deal ,1
i love this restaurant i just to live in seoul and you won t find any other place in prague that even comes close to the same the owner is a wonderful man originally from seoul so he knows what he is doing the staff is just lovely i would recommend this restaurant for any occasion ,1
we walked from old town prague to bibimbop korea didn t expect the walk to be so far but we were very pleased to have found the place and even happier when the busy restaurant was able to find a table for the 4 of us this restaurant was busy and booked full with reservations after having dined here i understand why the food is amazingly delicious service is prompt and attentive the staff there are polite and welcoming the food was served quickly and it was savored by all of us in our group wonderfully seasoned all the foods were the perfect temperature and plenty of drinks to go around the host was friendly and checked in on us during dinner a couple of times to be sure we had everything we needed wonderful service this place is the best korean food in prague definitely worth the walk or if you re hungry take a taxi but definitely don t miss out this place is the place to go and be sure to make a reservation ,1
decided to check this place out after reading the four star reviews on trip advisor they were correct excellent fresh food served with a big fat smile the only thing is it was hard to get a table but i think that was my fault as i told the group of people i was with 60ish and they got there before me and stole my restaurant ,1
4 days in prague and we visited this korean restaurant twice more if we had had the chance the food was exquisite kimchi jjigae chicken for 2 the pancake the bibimbap the service was not very fast but the owner is a very gentle man for dinner the restaurant gets croweded easily probably because it is the best in town but it is well worth the wait they would rather make you wait rather than make you sit next to strangers so for me it is a plus i more than recommended this place and wish they would move from prague to paris where i live ,1
absolutely delicious very tasty heart warming food and very friendly staff one of my favorite stops on my way home from work ,1
the food was delicious and the staff very friendly and helpful prices are very good for prague meals were prepared fast and fresh i had jaeyook and i was more than satisfied they even played k pop in the restaurant so the atmosphere was very pleasant there if i lived in prague i d go there very often ,1
very nice clean and welcoming good food well cooked very cheap meal for 2 with drinks less than 15 well worth a visit ,1
i had the traditional korean dish that s on the front of the menu just the right amount of spice staff was very friendly and happy to help they even told me the correct way to eat the dish try it ,1
we had a great time in the restaurant the food was very good and the waiter was incredibly cute and nice we absolutely recommend this place,1
if you want authentic korean dishes try this hidden gem this is the place you re looking for 어른분들 모시고 하는 여행이라 2 3일에 한번씩은 한식당 투어를 하고 있는데 이곳 일품입니다 특히 짬뽕 한국에서 먹던것보다 더 맛나요 그리고 인상 좋으시고 친절하신 사장님 you made my day not just delicious dishes the owner welcomed us with big smile ,1
food is very good staff is very nice and friendly everyone speaks english they have a korean wine that is part of the experience ,1
it was a fantastic experience and i just loved it small place clean and cosy place feel like you have lunch with family very polite personnel and the food just come and taste it you will enjoy every bite ,1
i went to bibimbap with my girlfriend and we both enjoyed the evening very much all waiters were very polite and genuinly nice i ordered the speciality bibimbap for affordable 150 czk i was very positively surprised that it included kimchi and a broth all very tasty though i asked for vege version of bibimbap i doubt the broth they brought me was vegetarian so i recommend to ask them about that if you re vegetaratian vegan the beer was also good and for a reasonable price all in all it was a very pleasent experience for good money ,1
we love this restaurant for occasional visit menu is not so big but the bibimbap is very tasty you get side of kimchi and soup owners are korean and staff is nice and helpfull prices are more than reasonable 150kc for bibimbap portions generous you will leave satisfied although spiciness level is probably tailored for locals as it is not that spicy at every visit we saw couple of koreans which i thing is sign that the place is good and somewhat authentic given the price and location ,1
really tasty food which is well priced nothing fancy just good honest cooking the owners seen to be a couple wife cooking husband out front he is very welcoming and a big reason we keep going back ,1
really great wholesome food just be aware that the spicy really is spicy i would most definitely recommend this place ,1
i really missed korean food after moving back from melbs to east central europe maybe reading all the excited reviews raised my expectations too high but what i found in bibimbap was a nice and rather busy low key and cosy restaurant with friendly staff and almost home like atmosphere but the choice of dishes was rather limited and food was a bit bland all in all this seems to be a nice and friendly place to go to with friends but do not expect really real korean ,1
today we tried for the first time real korean food at bibimbap korea the restaurant was not the easiest to find as it is a 5 min walk from zizkov tower hidden after a staircase and not so easy to spot we luckily used this map and eventually found it we ordered plum tea lemon tea common bibimbap and gimbap the flavor were new to us but very fresh and tasty plus presentation was very good as you could see they put passion in their dishes service was also attentive and staff was helpful i was also served fermented kimchi to taste but that was too extreme to me and i did not like it but every othet dish was amazing totally recommend ,1
first of all let me say this is not the most authentic korean food i have ever eaten but still the food was excellent the menu though was disappointingly small me and my boyfriend got rolls to share and mains everything was top quality and tasted amazing portions are big enough and we even left food on our plates which we rarely do great value for money the only thing i felt really bad about was that i left the wrong tips which was almost nothing other than that i would revisit definitely ,0
i had bogogi bibimbap and beer have to say i m quite disappointed according to the reviews i was expecting authentic korean food however my bibimbap has lots of arugula and lettuce this is salad with minced beef on top of the rice not authentic not even spicy ,0
말이 필요 없는 최고의 한식이었다 한국 맛집이랑 비교해도 손색이 없는 맛이고 사장님도 친절하셔서 더욱 좋았다 한달동안의 유럽여행중 가장 맛있는 식사가 아니었나 싶다 it was a beautiful foods you must try it,1
while the food quality was good the service was terrible we waited over an hour for our food and although the manager apologized for the delay that he blamed on a full house i was quite annoyed that a couple seated more than fifteen minutes after us were served their meal which did not seem any less complicated than ours before us so if you don t mind the wait go ,1
i went there because i stayed in a nearby hotel i took the classic bibimbap menu and really enjoyed it the food quality was very good the staff was very friendly the price is very good in relation to the quality of the food it s not in the usual tourist location but nearby a tram stop it s certainly worth to take the short trip to go there ,1
great food friendly staff options for vegetarians as i am reasonably priced it s worth a visit if your in the area ,1
classic korean food for a really good price really delicious korean dishes the atmosphere was really good and the staff was really friendly i would definitely come and eat here again ,1
we went here on our last day of our trip we chose this place after seeing other reviews on tripadvisor and also since korean food is not usually easily available in europe we were not disappointed since we don t eat meat we asked the waitress to make a vegetarian bibimbap with eggs and veggies and use tofu instead of beef she gladly took our order also our order came with some kind of soup which was also nice and the kimchi was just like i was expecting i also took the ginger tea which i also liked was sweet but i think it might not be for everyone ,1
this is one of the more authentic korean restaurants i have been to outside of korea we ate here twice during our visit the quality of the ingredients is high everything is cooked fresh and the prices are unbeatable i highly recommend this restuarant to anyone who loves korean food the waitresses are not korean but it appears that the owner and the cook both are and there are always lots of korean people eating there we may go back for a third visit tonight ,1
the food was amazing and authentic at a really good price good service as well came here twice during my 3 day stay in prague ,1
literally bibimbab korea is the most authentic korean restaurant in prague i can taste real korean food in europe price is reasonable and the service was amazing i was full of surprised that the waitress can speak fluent korean and the best part is owner you can get the best korean cuisine in best price ,1
this is my go to korean restaurant in prague everything here is perfect the owner and staff are some of the kindest i ve encountered i ve been here over 10 times and the service is always perfect the food is truly authentic korean and the prices are pretty good as well ,1
found this korean restaurant by accident one day while randomly walking through a neighborhood in prague after living in korea for three years i have become a bit obsessed about authentic korean food i was not disappointed it was delicious and the service was great i would definitely go back ,1
we ordered 1 bulgogi bap 2 korean seafood pancake 3 gimbap 4 ramyeon 5 fried chicken 6 kimchi soup we love it all it s just too delicious the waitress non korean wasnt very friendly but the owner korean is very nice i would definitely recommend this if you are looking for asian taste in prague it is one if the best meal we ve ever had in eastern europe ,1
not expecting to find korean food in prague but this place is excellent tram 5 and 9 goes past it get down at lipanska stop cross the road and go down the stairs bibimbap was super good value pretty satisfying very happy to recommend this place for a good meal ,1
helpful staff low prices delicious food there is no reason why not to come if you like korean this is the place to be ,1
i just moved in the area close to this restaurant and after going there just by chance it has became my fav place for dinner on lazy evening food quality is very high and service is great always smiling and very polite my favorite dish is bibimbap but whatever i try new i enjoy ,1
the place was clean authentic and tasty also the service was very responsive and polite i am definitely coming back very recommendable for asian cuisine ,1
the restaurant is right at the lipanska tram stop bibimbap was good and tasty so was the kimchi soup with pork service was nice and friendly great korean food away from korea ,1
we made reservations for dinner we re glad we did as this little neighborhood korean restaurant is popular and for good reason the service is excellent english speaking servers helped a great deal in this regard the menu is descriptive with english listings the food is wonderfully fresh and artistically presented we plan to return and we recommend that you go for it too ,1
the menu was a tad too long but the presentation was very good the owner met us personally and the staff was really helpful and efficient i can t say it is authentic korean cuisine but they have tried very hard at maintaining authenticity while wooing the locals i think they couldn t do more very pleasurable experience would definitely visit again ,1
i love bibimbap i love this restaurant best place evr enjoy this place when i am in prague i must visit and eating in this restaurant ,1
my friend and i wanted a hot meal after a long day of tourism in prague and bibimbap couldn t have been better we ordered an udong and a kimchi jigae and they were both amazingly delicious the banchan was also really nice and the service was also nice the owner was there and greeted us also the price was absolutely great ,1
we spent last 18 months traveling around we were always looking for korean bistro to fulfill our desire for our favourite bibimbap this actually never happened because the best and only real bibimbap for us is the one that mr mrs lee are serving in their restaurant there is no better korean restaurant in english and spanish speaking world their recipes for kimchi and tuna soup are just perfect soup is so strong and tasty it is a cure for any weakness we went there yesterday after all those months new place in zizkov looks beautiful servers are super friendly and happy as always and the food the food was maybe even better then i remember my favourite combo is bibimbap in non heated bowl mr lee s classic it is not korean traditional but the rice stays soft all the time and not ower dry from warmth of the bowl soup and kimchi comes with the meal total price of czk150 is cheap for what you get and really good price point so everyone can afford this experience tuna sushi to share czk130 for 14pcs maxi roll yummy i just love this place must visit in prague for sure ,1
no fuss or gimmick in the restaurant style but when the food came it was beautiful in looks and the taste was fantastic the potion size was great not too big and definitely not small kimichi rice was excellent and the classic bimbimbap with salad was super we went at lunch and it was not overly busy highly recommended look forward to the next visit to try something else ,1
this restaurant used to be near my office and we went there almost every week thanks to bibimbap korea i was introduced to korean food and it was love at first sight i am very happy that even though they ve moved from near my office now they are near my home and we go almost every week for dinner delicious food esp bibimbap and really nice service for a very reasonable price the average item on the menu costs around 150 160 crowns i couldn t recommend this restaurant more ,1
so glad we found this restaurant via tripadvisor the food was amazing the portions were huge and i d recommend trying the delicious classical bibimbap the first dish on the menu we felt so welcomed by the friendly staff and owners we returned for dinner on the same day this was one of the highlights of our dining experience in prague and we ll definitely come back during our next trip ,1
small bistro with homemade korean food and homemade feel no design please great place to discover the cuisine for very reasonable price bonus the owner is very nice gentleman ready to share advice on your next trip to korea concentrate on food not on the appearance ,1
a very nice suprice for a fraction of money you would spend in restaurants in direct city center we recived hudge portions of dishes so tastefull that we just could not stop eating even we were full after half of the dish a must see place if you are in zizkov ,1
this is a gem you really won t want to miss especially worth mentioning is the bulgogi bibimbap second option on the menu right past the nomen omen dish bibimbap the ambience is cozy sweet very familiar what a nice find in prague ,1
nice people very good and healthy food i m surprised by the quality the price is unbeatable in that sense second time i come and will do again,1
outstanding korean food love that they have a variaty of different bibimbap instead of just the normal btw the normal bimbimbap is served like the dolsot bibimbap in hot stone bowl i had the one with pork meat and it was great lovely spicy taste prices are absolutely fine and definitely worth the money seems like they have lunch offers aswell female waitress even spoke korean ,1
i ve been to a couple of korean places around prague but this one is my favourite the menu is quite simple but the bibimbap is delicious and they have a selection of kimbap as well to help my frequent kimbap cravings what i love is that their bibimbap comes with such good and plentiful veggies that it s more or less a healthy dinner in my possibly not especially objective opinion the owner is super sweet and talkative and is clearly very proud of his little establishment ,1
we stopped by for lunch after reading the previous reviews and weren t disappointed both of our dishes were fantastic we can recommend the bibimbap number 1 one of the best we ve had authentic and tasty and all for a reasonable price it s quite nice to dine in exactly as pictured and there s wifi the owner and all the staff were friendly and welcoming definitely recommend if you re in the area ,1
this place is a must try the food is wonderful the staff is smiling and great i had a sundubu jjigae and i enjoyed it greatly it was my first korean food experience in prague and i have no regret ,1
excellent taste especially to korean tourists who look for real korean foods the bibimbab that the restaurant serves is the best one that i have ever eaten outside korea ,1
one of the best korean restaurants ive ever been yet very cheap try the kimchi if you like traditional korean dishes the owner is a nice guy smiling all time ,1
nase nejoblibenejsi restaurace se skvelou obsluhou a vybornym jidlem the best korean food and service in prague ,1
great korean cuisine very friendly staff and reasonable prices i m coming back to eat through the whole menu ,1
we were very surprised to find a korean restaurant in prague and especially one this good the service is very friendly and the food is great the best thing we had was the kimpap or gimbap we have had this many times before and i think this was my favourite one we also had the ramyeon which was really good for a cold night and bibimbap in a stone bowl was nice but could do with some more vegetables it s very reasonable priced to eat here so order a bottle of soju and enjoy ,1
we visited this restaurant because of the recommendation of one of my friend the owner of the restaurant was very helpful as it was our first visit of the korean restaurant we also took the rice wine which was bit unusual but great if you want to try something new come here ,1
i went here with my friend it was difficult to find a food that is not spicy my kimči pokum bap was basically rice with red curry paste and fried bits of carrot and yammi egg on the top it was really cold cleaning spicy food and i enjoyed it a lot yellow tea i took it without honey sugar and it was not my favourite kind of tea it tastes as burnt rice it wasn t my favourite taste but i drank it and felt good afterwards it was a lovely experience to taste the spicy food with refreshing rather sour salad the price was great for the food we got our budget was to stay under 200 czk for one meal and one drink per person and we did manage without problems the atmosphere was simple it s not a place where i would go for interior design but food was my goal this time and it exceeded expectations the serves was really friendly and explained all tastes and combinations i really appreciated it i will come back again ,1
delicious hearty meal with genuinely friendly and caring service the only downside is the waiting time about 45 minutes for two mains but the freshness of the food is certainly worth the wait ,1
my girlfriend and i were craving some korean food and this really hit the spot it s very difficult to find decent authentic korean food in europe so this was a really lucky find food is good service is friendly and prices are reasonable don t miss out ,1
its a new resturant that opend 4 days before we arrive the manger and his wife were so nice and the food was amazing prices were good its first time i ate korean food and i felt like im in a dream im speechless,1
we visited in an early january lunch time only the two of us and a student in another table all the food were very mediocre when we started to think the pork bibimbap was quite good the rice was piping hot but when we put the pork in the mouth they were fridge cold so just ate the rice without the pork when we mentioned it after paying the server said the pork was precooked and stored in the fridge they forgot to warm it up before putting them on the rice ,1
free byo but have a couple of beers available food was a really interesting range of flavours many familiar some not decent portions well presented felt slightly expensive for more of a cafe than a restaurant but was happy with value at the end of the day ,1
i m quite confused about how this places gets good reviews for a plate of vegetable dumplings fried squid that was thin and covered in panko and oily and a plain plate of beef short rib 15 bulgogi without rice or anything we paid 33 what the actual help the portions were tiny too we were given tap water in a re usable pink plastic water bottle you use to take water on your bicycle and then at the end of the meal 2 slices of orange on a plate by far the most bizarre and most expensive meal we have had which was not worth even 5 to make we felt this was some kind of joke still can t quite believe it both of us a size 10 we went for food afterwards unbelievable ,0
my friends an i have thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at seoul gaja formerly known as dain korea pancakes squid bibimpap so good great taste kind of spicy but not too much i ve only tried seafood but i m looking forward to going back and try other stuff the service is fast of polite definitely cheap considering the quality of the food highly recommended ,1
the setting is quite basic and if you want a fancy setting then it would be better to go somewhere else the focus is all on the food here which was amazing i loved the plain setting it added to the ambiance and authenticity of the food which was delicious you can see part way into the kitchen and there s an honesty about that too the portions were generous and the service was excellent i can see why it is such a favourite you can have a super meal here at a very reasonable price especially if you bring your own drinks ,1
the menu includes a large variety of different korean dishes portions are big and food is tasty we were given a free starter of salad kimchi and radish cash only staff were friendly note the name has changed to seoul gaja ,1
lovely delicious food and service think it s change it s name now to seol but same establishment korean spicy chicken especially tasty atmosphere could do with attention though as a bit too basic ,1
a group of us ate here last month the group consisted of vegetarians meat eaters and myself who at the time was followed a vegan diet everyone of us was pleased with the dishes we chose and the complimentary kimchi and salads i am looking forward to returning again ,1
some of the best food i ve had in months looks completely forgettable from the outside but as soon as you step inside you ll know it s something special incredibly attentive waiting staff cheap yet plentiful portions of incredible food booking essential on weekends ,1
always very welcoming wide selection of typical korean dishes extra sauce provided if you want it hotter we had noodles rice dishes and fish prawns all very tasty with complimentary salads and raw pickles very very tasty especially chicken and vegetarian dumplings well worth a visit to this friendly korean restaurant with delicious ginger tea ,1
we booked out the whole restaurant for a group of about 30 people and everybody had a wonderful time the food was great really flavourful and tasty and the service was excellent too i was so impressed with the speed at which they brought out 30 orders and made no mistakes at all because i think that many people can be quite tricky to manage all in all it was a wonderful meal ,1
incredible food me and my friend ordered the 26 set menu thinking it would be just enough for the two of us and it was so much food amazing value for money and brilliant quality which is rare in this day and age the staff were friendly and efficient and the service was very quick a quirky and delicious little spot for all occasions 10 10 ,1
i heard great things about this restaurant from a korean friend they weren t wrong myself and 15 friends had dinner here for my birthday the setting itself is average but the smells coming from the kitchen enhance the atmosphere tenfold each person ordered a few different dishes the tables were full to the brim i can honestly say that every single dish was incredible the menu is full of choice i d recommend trying a few different things and sharing the only thing that let this experience down was the service there was one waitress working and found it difficult to accommodate the 16 of us ordering took a really long time as she had trouble understanding what we wanted the menu is numbered so we thought it would be simple enough but she said she didn t know what each number was subsequently she then wrote down a few of our orders incorrectly but hey the food completely overshadowed that one small issue will be returning frequently ,1
went for lunch today and really enjoyed it food was authentic and very tasty will definitely return to try more from the menu ,1
the food and the service are overall good but i was not really impressed it was my first time in a korean restaurant so i might need to increase the sample i would try it again ,1
still the best bipimbap i ve had in bristol great little place on my first visit they even gave helpful instructions on how to eat this korean delight mix it all together and tuck right in ,1
have had dinner here quite a few times each time ordering korean dishes and a few sushi dishes all food super tasty and authentic,1
excellent food the noodles are amazing all good was great perfect with family and they were helpful with our young child super friendly staff and great value ,1
we went in a group of at least 20 and everyone enjoyed their food and the fact that it was byob lol very much as someone who is allergic to both nuts and sesame it was also a bit of treat to be able to safely eat asian food the staff were very receptive when i explained my problemos i highly recommend getting the udon kimchee soup it revitalised me to the max ,1
really good service of two lovely young waitresses but i just don t know if i liked the food it was either extremely spicy or sweet the restaurant itself was a bit grubby it could do with a lick of paint throughout and it would really brighten the place up ,1
the food is amazing very authentic and the size of dishes is more than enough prices are very reasonable but you can only pay by cash will definitely go back ,1
i booked this for a birthday celebration and chose the banquet options the food was flavoursome and delicious and because it s byo the evening was even better value too we were a large party in a small restaurant but the service was always efficient and friendly but great for couples small gatherings and families too i ve recommended some dishes but it was all delicious,1
i ve been eating here for a few years with no complaints but when we ate here recently they said they are no longer serving sushi it s still on the menu which is a bit misleading i usually have a beef bibibap which is delicious but decided to try something else and had some starters and seafood yaki soba i agree with other reviews the starters are a bit expensive and the yaki soba was bland and not very nice my friend wasn t that impressed with his meal choice either the service was a bit patchy which i can forgive if the food is good but sadly this wasn t the case this visit i would still highly recommend the bibibap menu and please can you can start serving sushi again thank you ,1
first time going to a korean restaurant we had very reasonable meals agree that the starters are a bit expensive but there is complimentary kim chee and also pickled radishes there are also japanese dishes on the menu so there were things that all in our group could eat there were a few things on the menu that weren t available on a friday night which was a bit unexpected dessert for one but we were very happy to have eaten here and my daughter knew many of the korean songs so she was happy too bibimbap excellent whether vegetarian beef chicken or raw beef byo also ,1
an amazing array of korean dishes came to the table in no particular order as they were cooked it made for an interesting meal the restaurant is plain in decor and it doesn t need to make an effort as the food speaks for itself it is byo which makes it reasonably priced but not cheap the food was spicy hot and flavoursome and we enjoyed all that we ordered ,0
been here several times because it is byo which is great recommend number 75 on the menu can t remember what it is called but it is spicy and comes absolutely boiling hot so takes a while to eat also reccomend the bibimbap if you don t like spice as much you can add as much hot sauce as you like then you mix up all of the dish and it is delicious would say avoid the starters as they are very expensive 5 7 and you don t get as much compared to the mains good place for a birthday meal staff are great ,1
in contrast to the more westernised korean pan asian spots in bristol this place is a good shout if you re looking for the real deal it s byob which is most definitely a plus in terms of value but implies a casual milieu would recommend for an impromptu dinner with friends we were all very satisfied with our food excellent kimchi although i found the menu to be quite extensive and so it took some time for me to decide i plan to visit again to try some of the more adventurous menu items ,1
visited dain korea as a family for an evening birthday meal was not disappointed it s tucked away and is definitely not what you expect from the exterior the waitress was lovely and attentive easily explained ingredients of particular dishes we visited as a group of four and over ordered the side dishes are very generous almost a full meal in themselves and we were given plenty of banchan korean side dishes to accompany our meal food was delicious 2 4 had seafood dishes that were perfect no nasty after effects either super spicy and warming dishes main meals plenty it has a byob policy on larger quantities of alcohol but does serve 2 types of asian beer along with soft drinks would 100 reccomend visiting we ll definitely be back ,1
went for a date night meal with my girlfriend and was not disappointed the food was delicious and the staff were friendly and very helpful if you like korean food then you must give this place a try ,1
our son has been asking us to eat in a korean restaurant for some time and this weekend we tried it this restaurant is just a small very unassuming basic establishment on bristols bohemian gloucester rd the decor is very street food style the staff very welcoming with a smile the menu is quite extensive and unless you have some guidance it is possible to select the wrong dish i has a sweet beef style dish accompanied with iceberg lettuce and a soya bean sauce my son had a dish with mixed veg and an egg on top and my wife had a chicken glass noodle one all really tasty and cooked well its byo and they offer free water we will return ,1
my partner who lived in korea has been bemoaning the lack of good korean food in bristol we stumbled on dain korea by mistake and went a bit wild when ordering food dumplings korean pancakes rib broth and bibimbap later we were stunned and happy everything was authentic and tasty and we enjoyed the restaurant s relaxed byob approach ,1
having heard good things we my girlfriend and i were excited to have dinner at dain korea last night unfortunately it didn t live up to the hype my yaki soba chicken was distinctly lacking in chicken and was generally bland and tasteless and my girlfriend s spicy seafood soup was oily and didn t have much to it this is one place we won t be going back to ,0
bristol is full of different cultures and cuisines that come with such a diverse population dain korea offers a mixture of korean and japanese cuisine i came here for the korean food and was not disappointed ,1
such a nice korean restaurant nothing posh but tasty healthy and affordable food you can bring your own drinks and the guy who attended us was really nice i ordered bibimbap with row beef and it was really good more than enough food 100 recommended ,1
must try ive lived in korea before and the dishes are all up to standard the service is good and it is great value i recommend the kimchi soup la galbi and the mandu will go whenever im in bristol ,1
as a head chef myself i have to say that was thee best food i have ever eaten what ever you are paying you re chef pay him some more the man was born to cook ,1
so many times we ve just pitched up with a like 20 people sometimes more and they just deal like yeah it s nothing yo here s some bang up kimchi and other yommy foods you bring your own booze and they supply the food i love the bi bim bap cos you just get to stick the chopsticks in and mix it up and shovel it into your mouth soooooo goood i literally love it thanks dain ,1
we really enjoyed our meal here on friday night delicious food good service and it s bring your own booze which makes it a cheap night out ,1
been going to this restaurant for a while the staff is super friendly and the food is amazing you even get the little kimchi and radish as a starter which is brilliant also for those that never tried it so they can have a bit of a taste before ordering the bbq is cooked in the kitchen instead of at the table but it tastes lovely so it s still worth it would also advise the tang su yuk for a starter if you re a fan of sweet and sour ,1
good value for money food with great service and impressed of trying korean food for first time i will definitely revisit,1
increds food ignore the questionable shop front branding the food is hashtag amazeballs order the korean bbq it s different levs totes like ,1
staff are really helpful large selection of dishes food was good but not excellent in my opinion i enjoyed side dishes and accompaniments better than main ones,0
went for a meal on tuesday with my wife and have to say we both left with big smiles on our faces initially the decor does not look that promising but that is not really the point here it is functional and clean however the food is what makes this place a real find we had a starter of prawn mandu which are like gyoza lovely flavour with a beautifully crisp edge for mains i had the beef bibimbap which was beautifully flavoured essentially a rice dish but once all the ingredients are mixed in the bowl as is the custom the texture and flavours are luxurious and finely balanced my wife had a noodle dish which was just as good they do sell some alcohol but you are welcome to bring your own for a small corkage definitely will be making a return visit,1
i went there a few days ago and i have to say that it was one of the best meals i ve had in recent years the staff were really attentive and helpful the interior looked really nice and the food was amazing i am really looking forward to the next time i can visit i would recommend this to anyone looking for delicious korean food ,1
love this place i come about once a month everyone i take just adores it too delicious food good service and amazing value for money ,1
went to dain korea for a small party the food was nice and the service very good they were very accommodating and happy for us to decorate etc we didn t feel rushed and was a really nice atmosphere bring your own alcohol too which is great reasonably priced and their hot pots are really nice i ve had better sushi but wasn t bad my only gripe was that it took them a very long time to clear our table once we d finished eating but only a minor thing would recommend ,1
highly recommended this place took me back to my time in south korea authentic korean soul food that i dearly missed seeing the chef attend all tables and asking how the food was really blew me away something i haven t seen in a long time great touch definitely felt the love in the cooking most of all its veggie friendly no pork in the broths thank you for the great experience and catering for vegetarians our new favourite restaurant ,1
went there twice not disappointed i would say it serves a more authentic taste compared to the others simple place but with great food price range from 10 to 15quid a person i d recommend the sundubu jjigae kimchi soup but the pancakes are very nice too ,1
the restaurant is very simple and basic the service is a bit slow but the food is great you can bring drinks from outside a recommendation always ask for information about what the dishes are spicy sometimes they are too ,1
having the best sampled the best of korean restaurants in new malden surrey i was excited to hear of a korean restaurant in bristol visiting with friends from london on a wednesday night i was a little disappointed to see it was a korean and japanese place and was even more disappointed in the menu there was key korean and japanese dishes but not enough of either however the korean pork dumplings were not shop bought and very tasty always a good thing the bib am bab was very average not something i d be rushing back to have ,1
had a staff night there on thursday 17 03 2016 we were a table of 6 and i can tell that we all felt the same way the food was really good and fresh however service was not that good we asked for 6 wine glasses byob by the way and we had to ask them to change three of them as they were really dirty one of them even had some salad on it then we ordered some starters to share which were all great and 6 main course as 5 of us had our meals served after 45 minutes wait after we finished the starters which were not cleared from the table one of us didn t get his meal we had to ask the waiter for the 6th meal which they forgot about i noticed during the dinner that other tables were not cleared until someone else was arriving overall a descent restaurant with good prices but a poor customer service experience ,0
went here with two friends on a tuesday night we waited ages to order and in the end just went up to the till we then waited 40 minutes just for our drinks and again we only got them because we went up and asked we were never asked if we wanted anything else and when it came time to pay again we had to go up and ask after waiting for ages there were other people in the same situation i even saw one customer walk out after waiting without being served it s a shame because the food is actually quite nice i just don t think they understand the concept of customer service no matter how good the food it s not worth the ordeal ,1
i first went here in september 2015 and i just can t stop going it s so reasonably priced delicious and authentic both the japanese and korean food never fails to impress great as a nice 1 2 1 evening meal with partner or with a group of friends the fact it s byob is just a bonus ,1
highly recommended if you want good food i lived in korea between 2002 2004 and since returning to the uk i had struggled to find a place that served proper korean grub until now dain korea s food is as good as anything i ve eaten in the motherland the decor is a little basic and it s not the place you d go to for a posh night out but if you re after some top nosh then give this place a whirl ,1
my son recommended this restaurant but said it was very basic and that the food might not be for us he was wrong this place provides korean and japanese food and is situated on busy gloucester road it is unimposing from the outside but is clean and smart inside cooking is done by two very busy chefs in full view of diners the waitress was korean japanese herself and was only too willing to guide us through the extensive menu most of which we couldn t understand i had a prawn tempura wrap to start with a bit of square of salmon and some wasabi which i was wary of from past experience delicious and for my main a large bowl of rice shredded veg mushrioms prawns etc with a bowl of miso soup to mix in with it all topped with an egg yum my husband had a chicken starter and a pork curry for his main which was too hot for him the waitress was very concerned and said the chef would tailor any food to the required degree of hotness on a scale of 1 5 we had green tea icecream to finish you can bring your own wine but there is japanese beer on offer which my husband said was very good and a variety of teas and soft drinks this is an unpretentious busy little place which provides super fresh tasty food at a reasonable price the staff were lovely and for us it was nice to go somewhere a little different and guess what we are returning with visiting family in less than a week by the way my malasian friend kniws this place well and recommends the chilli daddy takeaway they do those too ,1
waitress service is poor missing out drink and food orders they definitely need more training or be valued well as part of the team we had to physically approach them and chase up missing drink and food items as it was difficult to get their attention if they bothered to ask if we had sufficient drinks or if the meal was satisfactory they will soon have realised the missing orders trying to pay took a minimum of 15 mins despite physically going up to pay to try speed up the process note we were not the only ones in the same situation as others repeatedly asked for their bills staff were slow at cleaning up other people s table on a hot summer day which is not pleasant to look at poor management of table arrangement and greeting of new guests doesn t create the best atmosphere observation sitting new customers down but not giving them a menu until the guests asked for a menu and taking another table s order who sat down after them at which the guests did comment food was ok starters are better than the mains if i m honest there are better korean restaurants in bristol will not be returning or recommending to friends family ,1
this is our second time of eating at dain korea the food is lovely and the service was quick the simplicity of the cafe restaurant give the place authenticity we would definitely go again ,1
a great selection of vegetarian options the staff are really friendly well priced with byo and amazingly tasty food i will be visiting here again ,1
the place is so good i loved it since first time i went there very tasty and authentic korean food almost same as the food i tasted when i was in korea the staff is very friendly and would advise on the menu but the most amazing thing about them is that they do delivery although not everywhere but if you are in the centre or around you are good me and my friends order delivery all the time and it s so useful especially during exam period when everyone is too busy with revision but you have to order food for more than 20 which is ok if you are ordering with your friend ,1
the menu includes many japanese dishes sushi teriyaki etc but most are korean i told the charming and friendly waitress that i did not know korean cuisine and asked her to recommend she pointed me at bibimap it s served in a hot earthenware bowl with boiled rice in the bottom making it crispy layered with cooked vegetable choice of chicken beef pork prawn or tofu beef recommended and taken and an egg so the flavours go down into the rice served with your own bottle of red chilli paste so you can control how hot you want it i loved it and can t wait to go back we washed it down with a 375ml bottle of 18 rice wine that went well and had a clean slightly vodka like flavour with a couple of side dishes and salads we happily paid 20 each and left feeling full and satisfied the same menu is served for lunch mostly at reduced prices a definite bargain ,1
we had a meal at dain korea for mothers day we ve been there before and i have gone for a cheap lunch on a few occasions positives it serves authentic korean cuisine the price is very reasonable mains around 10 00 there is a great value cash only lunch menu the korean set meals are good value if you are hungry potential improvements the interior is a little tired previously it was a short lived burger joint and it can lack a little ambiance that said i quite like unpretentious cafes and restaurants on the day we visited we had two children they are from the lunch menu and my wife and i ate from the main korean set meal the kids liked their noodle dish udon chicken noodles our menu consisted of lots of side dishes as per korean kimchi pickled vegetables bulgogi bbq beef kimchi pork and tofu stew boiled rice we were full after that cost us around 58 00 with drinks total we took our own wine conclusions if you want to try korean food a little different from your normal asian food you should give it a go good place to go for lunch too perhaps not that a romantic setting for couples give it a go ,1
have eaten here many times now friendly staff very laidback slightly shabby interior most importantly amazing food always feel good after eating here little extras like miso kimchee etc really make it plus it s byob ,1
unpretentious cafe i went there for lunch and ordered from the lunch menu a bibimbap with beef it had a nicely fried egg and very fresh veg and some accompaniments miso soup kimchee and a few other things which a wash down with a watery citron tea the food was very good value the full menu was while not as cheap as the lunchtime specials also reasonably priced i gather it gets busy at night it was not very busy at lunch though and the staff had no trouble not i think a place for romantic nights out but a good place to enjoy with friends ,1
the restaurant doesn t look much from the outside and when you go in the decor is fairly basic but don t let that put you off the food is really authentic healthy delicious byob best dish we ve tried the raw beef bibimbap ,1
this was our first time here food was incredible staff were lovely and we really liked how chilled out it was here byob for 1 corkage per person you can t go wrong will definitely be going back ,1
i popped in here with friends for an evening meal the building and interior were shabby the staff were friendly but very slow and not very attentive the food was of quite bad quality for the price i had a chicken dish which was very salty the plus side is that it was byo i will not be returning in a hurry ,0
we went to dain korea twice and both times we loved it we liked the sushi and the squid we also really liked the presentation of the food it looks good honest we didn t like the atmosphere that much as it looks a bit weird but who cares if the food is simply amazing we really liked it and we will return ,1
i ordered the bambinbap sp which was slightly spicy tasty and filling it also came with a side salad pickled ginger and a small miso soup overall a pleasant find with attentive service ,1
on our last day in bristol we popped into this restaurant for lunch although it looked pretty empty the ambience was a bit on the dark side and it didn t appear very clean with an open kitchen that looked like a corridor once we sat down we ordered mandu which i guess is the korean version of gyoza the flavour wasn t too bad although i would have left it a bit more in the pan to get the pastry a bit crispier the seafood pancake which didn t appear to have much seafood inside with spring onion wasn t too bad either although the middle was uncooked and had a gluey consistency then came the masterpiece we orderered 2 katsu curry chicken and pork from the special lunch menu but we got was 2 cutlets in gloopy sauce that i believe is a different dish and it remainded me of branston pickle i had the pork and the colour of the meat was almost black and had a funny taste my fiancé s chicken was a touch better but again it had a funny taste we complained and they asked if we wanted something else and because we were famished we asked if we could have 2 portions of mandu instead which were the best part of our meal but this time they arrived undercooked and one of them was cold in the middle i don t have a problem if they were frozen before but at least they could have been cooked properly it is not that they were too busy either there was us and another table so why the rush we complained again and the waitress then later on the owner pretended that there was a misunderstanding regarding the curry well that wasn t our problem as we had ordered from the daily special menu and there was only one curry option anyway the owner wanted us not to pay the bill but we insisted that we wanted too and at end we paid for the 2 dishes we ate this has to be one of the most unpleasant meals for sometime ,0
went in for lunch and really impressed chose two things off the lunch menu bulgogi beef and a rice bowl both were only 6 99 and were fantastic they were generous portions and they gave a miso soup and kimchi with the lunch both dishes were really tasty and hot amazing for the price we will definitely be back and look forward to trying more service was really good and the waitress was very friendly ,1
having wanted to visit dain for a while we were finally in the area when the restaurant is opened had a simple meal of fried rice chicken udon and dduk buk ki the soup for the udon for quite sweet for us but otherwise we enjoyed the food there is nothing pretentious about this restaurant no gimmicks just decent korean food which to us is a plus we could feel that the chef put his heart into the food he prepared thank you ,1
have been to dain korea three times now and have never been disappointed the service is always quick and friendly the menu is quite expansive and the food is extremely cheap given its quality byob keeps the bill right down and means that this is a good place to dine with friends or in reasonably large groups some might find the atmosphere a little strange it s a small place packed with seating and the decor manages to be both sparse and eclectic black and white prints of amsterdam canals anyone for me this is a big plus it s unpretentious and friendly and is a good sign that they are rightly concentrating on the quality of the food over style makes for a relaxed and welcoming meal the food is always fantastic can t get enough of the kim chee and the dolsot bibimbap is excellent at this price you might expect rice dishes and the like to be stodgy and nondescript but the spices and flavours are vibrant and crisp there s an array of dishes and a lot of reasonably priced starters and sides so you can dip in and out of several different foods menu is a bit light on vegetarian food which is why i can t give 5 stars but that s more down to korean cuisine i suspect than the restaurant itself there s also quite a lot of tofu and vegetable dishes to keep you busy i always leave feeling happy and satisfied as well as a little drunk long live dain korea ,1
been several times my favourite is the jjam bong which is consistently delicious like nothing else i have eaten in uk great prices and byo so you cant go wrong free kim chee and soy beans make the meal a great and sociable experience dain korea is a winner ,1
the food was delicious really quickly served with excellent staff 100 recommendable never tried korean food before but now i am looking forward to try a new dish ,1
found dain suddenly in gloucester road we went there often reasonable price and authentic cook highly recommend ,1
one of the best places to eat in bristol a personal favorite which never disappoints will be returning ,1
we found dain korea by accident but it is now one of our favourites have been 5 times the food is pretty amazing great quality fresh tasty and plenty of it plus the added extras like the miso soup are fab for us i think one of the biggest reasons we go back and have recommended dain korea to our friends and family is because it s very good quality the staff in particular are incredible friendly make us feel really welcome the sushi is pretty good too and smashes places like yo sushi out of the park the only thing i would say is that because it s made to order there can be a wait when it s busy but what would you rather microwaved precooked fast food or beautiful fresh dishes it s a no brainer it s also byo for 2 a head bargain love it can t wait to return ,1
just had a lovely meal here tasty food friendly staff and reasonable price the decor is a little plain but the food and service make up for it definitely recommend 7,1
fantastic food fantastic price fantastic staff we can t get enough of this place we visit quite often as it s so close to my work the food is always freshly prepared and tastes fantastic dolsot bi bim bap is my favourite but try to try other things too as the menu is just brilliant the décor is not much but you come here for the food ,1
eaten here loads of times and it is a favourite for us a bit scruffy but is clean and friendly and the food is delicious there s a really substantial menu of korean and sushi and i m trying to choose some of the many dishes i ve never heard of but keep going for the amazing bibimbap also recommend the bulgogi ,1
as a korean i can vouch for the dishes authenticity really tasty food with fresh ingredients apart from the prices my favourite thing about the place was probably that they don t use msg which can be commonly used in cheap oriental restaurants friendly service too the place is cheap and cheerful don t expect luxurious decor if you are new to korean go for the classic bibimbap dish ,1
had a good lunch here great value they have both pork and chicken korean curry dishes on the menu i had the chicken which was great but i would have said that the sauce was nearer to sweet and sour than curry i enjoyed it though my wife had the pork and that came with a completely different sauce nearer to the sort of curry sauce you get from a chinese takeaway anyway she enjoyed it too although its a byo they do sell korean beer ,1
been to this place a few months ago price was very reasonable but the foods taste was quite average atmosphere was a bit boring too nice staff though ,1
we visited dain korea when it first opened and it was instantly one of my favourite restaurants it offered great authentic korean food and a great price i was however a little disappointed about my last trip there it seems like standards are starting to slip the portions are getting smaller and the quality is starting to go down a little mince beef in the bibimbap rather than steak i also feel that the prices have raised slightly that said this is still by far the best korean restaurant in town far far better than surakahn and i will be returning soon just maybe not quite as soon as i would have done based on my first impressions ,1
this friendly welcoming bring your own restaurant is one of gloucester road s gems the food is delicious the prices low and the service laid back and friendly the hot earthenware dishes that cook as you stir them with the tangy chilli sauce are delicious and the noodle soups really really tasty so grab some friends grab some bottles and head down there asap enjoy ,1
good selection of smaller dishes and the bibimbap is also very good as it is bring your own this helps to make this a great budget option for the area ,1
good food good service good price highly recommended for those who enjoy korean authentic dishes ,1
this restaurant offers an extensive menu with plenty of vegetarian options service quick and very friendly recommended,1
the food was quite nice but this is why i will never go again 7 30 me and 7 friends arrive 7 55ish our orders are taken 8 00 a korean family also of 8 arrive 8 55ish having received and eaten their food the family leave 9 10 my table s first starter appears ,0
the lunch deal was unbeatable price for such a korean meal very authentic and we got served by a lovely korean lady if you are here in bristol you must go and try this little restaurant ,1
the food service and atmosphere is brilliant authentic korean cuisine at great prices a byo so another place different tastes a great place to visit especially if you are feeling bored of the standard fine dining michelin menus ,1
i ve been searching an authentic korean restaurant in bristol for ages and this place has finally satisfied those cravings don t let its unpretentious decor fool you despite being only a few months old dain korea shows good variety in its menu and the dishes taste authentic none of those letdown flavours adapted to cater to coddled less adventurous palates we re talking about the real deal here the staff are polite and attentive and we were promptly served complimentary banchan of braised soy sauce eggs and spicy pickled shredded cabbage while we waited for our order i ordered tteokbokki and pajeon both of which were delicious my companion who was a korean cuisine virgin prior to this visit was happy with his bibimbap as well only been here twice definitely looking forward to dining here again soon ,1
i have been searching for a decent reasonably priced korea restaurant for years i spent a year living in south korea and generally i find that korean restaurants in the uk are overpriced and the food is unauthentic this is certainly not the case with dain korea typically under decorated which is pretty reminiscent of real korean restaurants the food is the main attraction i m so happy we went here and we will be coming back again and again the staff are great and the lovely waitress who told me she was from daegu was really friendly i hope to go back once they are selling alcohol because the only thing that would make this better was if they also sold makgeolli as far as the food goes it was all exceptional the bulgogi is as amazing as it should be and the bibimbap was delicious the tang su yuk was a real treat as since leaving korea i haven t been able to find this anywhere else i d recommend anyone who hasn t tried this to do so even if you ve never tried korean food before you need to give this a go you won t regret it 10 10 감사합니다,1
very authentic korean food and great range in fact better than the korean food we ve had in central london reminded us of our time in seoul staff are freat too once you get chatting to them will be back the next time we are in bristol ,1
as a korean living in the uk i have been waiting for a decent korean restaurant in south west for more than 5 years i would recommend this restaurant as the one of the best korean restaurant in the uk in terms of food quality and price also staffs are very kind and you can bring your own beer or wine my wife and i have tried 7 dishes so far and we are going to try all dishes in their menu all of them taste exactly same as what you can have in korea ,1
the interior is very basic and they could have done with giving it a lick of paint before opening but i like the food a lot and the lunch menu in particular is incredible value i went with my wife and our bill for two meals and two drinks was under 12 i have already visited four times and will be back ,1
i have been waiting for the authentic korean restaurant here for such a long time and this restaurant finally opened a month ago and i m very pleased with their quality food everything is freshly cooked and their lunch deal start from 4 99 with miso soup and other appetisers we ve tried bibimbap yukgaejang kimchee jeon yang yeum chicken and sushi byo as additional bonus ,1
having lived in the far east this the most authentic korean food i have found in the uk prices very reasonable and lunch menu extremely good value good selection and good taste nice sushi too ,1
we love the bbq here and the seafood pancakes the staff is nice i absolutely recommend this place ,1
i visited there with my friends yesterday it was a little late their service was not so quick but the food was delicious i ordered ox tail soup which is very delicious ,1
my family and i were very pleasantly surprised to find this gem there was eight of us with each getting something different and everything was delicious a couple of us ordered grill items which you cook at the table yourself on built in grills each meal entree comes with numerous sides which is not clearly stated on the menu but trust me are brought out to you all the same our server was efficient and patient she answered all our questions cheerfully and trust me we had a lot i would highly recommend this restaurant ,1
brought our son here for his birthday he s a freshman in college and we asked him what he wanted for his birthday dinner and he said korean he just happens to have a korean professor who lives in the area and this is her favorite place we have our own favorite spot near home and this one was just as great the service was great and the food was delicious we loved it we now now where to go for korean food when we re in town ,1
from the outside cafe korea is just a restaurant in a strip mall but when you go inside it s a whole new world i was stationed in uijongbu and remembered delicious bbq places where you can grill at the table this is a rolls royce version of those bbqs the service is outstanding and the food is delicious and bountiful i got the bulgogi entree and my mom got dol sot bi bim bop we didn t know that we also got all of these yummy side dishes too the daughter of the owner came over to check on us it was an excellent experience i wondered if their food would taste like the bulgogi i had in the 80 s back in korea and it was i have rated a lot of restauraunts if i could have given this 6 stars i would it was 44 out the door including a generous tip ,1
my daughter and i tried out cafe korea for a special dinner and we were not disappointed the price for the dinners using the grill is up there but it was a relaxing interactive meal they served our choice of proteins thinly sliced and marinated with vegis and then we grilled them at the table also came with rice and a variety of korean side dishes the staff was very helpful and friendly ,1
good authentic korean food good service and price plenty of choices deliciously spicy not toxic great location looking forward to trying other korean dish ,1
i ve eaten at all the korean places in the indy metro area and this is the best very fresh and unique offerings this new location on allisonville has been total remodeled very modern every dish i ve had here has been over the top delicious keep up the great work we love you ,1
on arrival this is at the end of a strip mall the inside is pretty neat and clean the service is good i ordered the dolset bibimbop comes in a scorching hot bowl the most exceptional part was the beef very tender and tasty the best restaurant bulgogi i have ever had in a dish i was a little sad they did not give me cabbage kimchi for a side dish but other than some small traditional korean things i was hoping for the experience was great and i will definitely be back ,1
cafe korea s new location is easy to get to spacious and very pleasant inside they have bbq which i did not try but plan on it i lived in south korea for a year and absolutely love korean food especially bbq the food here is very expensive compared to korea but we re not in korea this is a novelty restaurant worth trying this food is very close to authentic and it is very good the side dishes were zingy those who worked there were fast efficient and very kind so great service overall again worth it ,1
we stopped by their new larger location last week for lunch great experience we ordered the soon dobu as well as the dolsot bi bim bop both came with a starter of a lettuce salad in addition we got 5 great little side dishes zucchini kimchi turnip kimchi sesame bean sprouts slightly sweet roasted potatoes salad and a great fried tofu the entree portions were very generous and both were just delicious food is very fresh and super flavorful very good value in a nice atmosphere with good service we will definitely be back ,1
this restaurant was recommended by a korean co worker in my wife s office when we visited most of the diners seemed to be of korean or oriental descent and appeared to be enjoying their food this is food i am unfamiliar with for the most part but i did enjoy the beef dish that i ordered we will probably give it another try ,1
this restaurant offered delicious korean cuisine accompanied by efficient friendly service i had the dol sot bi bim bop a dish of shredded vegetables and beef on rice with a hot sauce also the environment was clean warm and welcoming i would highly recommend this place ,1
this was our first time trying korean food luckily we went with friends who have been here before and knew good things to order we ordered several appetizers and entrees to share everything was good and there were very few leftovers the kimchi was excellent also try the plum and raspberry wine give this place a try for something different ,1
i came here with three family members we tried different dishes for appetizers we had the fried dumplings which were great the edamame which was a little dry and korean pancakes which were very good they served all tables a trio of kimche mung beans and greens we ordered separate dishes one was kimche soup which was well liked one was dumpling soup which was just okay another was spicy pork dupbop which is a dish of vegetables some pork and sweet potato noodles delicious but not sweet as you might think over rice and one which was delicious and other dish which i can t recall and was well liked decor is nice service was great ,1
i got here often it has great food and a sweet atmosphere it is well worth going and enjoying what they have to offer ,1
i think the first time i ate here was in 2012 or 2013 and the food was amazing and visited once every couple of weeks it s still a good option since there are only a couple of korean places in indianapolis i visited again recently and it seems like the quality has gone down a bit so that was disappointing to see ,0
i had the squid and spicy chicken and both were very tasty everything else was fresh and nicely prepared along with the food the service was fantastic and the whole restaurant gave off a positive vibe i definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some good korean food for lunch or dinner ,1
we come here from time to time and service is always good but can get a little bogged down when busy it is not a big place which adds to its charm but it can also get full very quick the menu has the basics i prefer more korean bbq foods but everything here is fresh and well prepared give it a shot ,0
don t know how ididn t know about this place right in the neighborhood great food that even my kids enjoyed ,1
i love this place i went there with my friends a few days ago and i just loved their food and service i ordered dolsot and one of my friends ordered galbi and they both were really delicious the seafood pancake was so good too i just wanted to eat more and more i ll be back to try something new ,1
first not sure why the address for this place is show as ny instead of in now to the review of the restaurant the staff here are always friendly and hard working they can get a little overwhelmed when busy so you may need to show some patience overall they do a great job the place is simple but clean and well maintained the food is very good and pretty authentic not a breath of items on the menu but they have all the staples so if you are craving good korean food then this is a solid choice ,1
cafe korea is an excellent source of various korean foods there are a lot of classics such as soon tofu dolsot and kimbap that they do wonderfully the little appetizers they provide along with the side dishes are awesome i definitely recommend this place to anyone seeking to try authentic korean food ,1
first off the restaurant was clean and well presented the staff had smiles on their faces as they greeted and took care of me on my stay when i ordered it took a little while but it was well worth it the food both looked amazing and tasted great if you happen to be in the area and are hungry definitely check out cafe korea asian food lovers will agree that this place is awesome ,1
i went to cafe korea with my sisters and i truly loved the experience there my sisters and i ordered dol sot bibimbop galbi and jokbal and they were great the salads the dressing side dishes and the kimchi were great to start off when we got our entrées we just couldn t stop saying this is so good the whole time it was the best korean food we ve ever had and we were more than satisfied with the experience the authentic taste of the food and of course the service after we were done eating we also got some desserts and loved them i ll definitely be coming back and can t stop thinking about the food i had on that night ,1
this was my first experience eating korean food a friend and i went to cafe korea for the first time but it won t be our last our server was very friendly and helpful he checked several times during our meal to make sure there was nothing we needed i ordered 1 bulgogi from the lunch menu the beef was very tender and the flavor was wonderful i never dreamed that korean food would be so good i ll definitely be eating at cafe korea again soon ,1
tonight was my 4th time in cafe korea seated and ordered our drinks ten minutes after party of 12 came in a lday staff asked me and my husband to moved to another table such rude we went out and will never go there again ,0
good and fresh reasonably priced i will return and enjoy again gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood,1
i m from south korea and can recognize the authentic flavor of korean food this place is small but the quality of the food is great clean and friendly service this is my go to place when i crave korean food fyi this place does not have the korean bbq grill ,1
i love asian soups and cafe korea doesn t disappoint i have had the soon tofu and the spicy beef broth i would recommend both the sides of spicy cucumber garlic spinach bean sprouts and kimche are a great addition service can be a little slow be careful if you order over the phone the staff does not speak english very and you might get a 25 dollar dish instead of the 8 dish you wanted ,1
first time there got a table at lunchtime but it was the only one left authentic korean restaurant but would have benefitted from a better description of the dishes for those like me who had not sampled this food before staff very friendly and food reasonably priced mostly delicious ,1
the king prawn starter was delicious the katsu chicken not so much the vegetable dumplings were not good the veggie in our group took a bite and suspected that it contained meat only after 3x going backwards and forwards were we able to determine that they contained quorn this was very poorly handled and none of the servers seemed to know what the dumplings contained my main was half cold 1 4 warm and 1 4 hot i was told that the hot bowl would warm my food but my friend had the same and her rice was too hot to eat so this cannot be the case i chose to leave my food we also ordered spicy chicken wings which tasted nice but the waiters walked past our table multiple times and we were only given napkins after about 15 minutes they seemed to avoid the table seemingly not wanting to deal with the situation and probably not wanting us to ask for it to be removed from the bill the bill came to 72 for the 4 of us we paid 20 each but would have been justified in not leaving a tip and requesting for the veg starter and main meal be removed it s a shame that they didn t offer a better level of customer service i can t in good faith reccommend them to others ,0
the food we all got was great fresh ingredients made fresh when we ordered the service was excellent as well one of the better korean experiences we ve had in london ,1
friendly and authentic korean reataurant reasonably priced perfectly located for a meal before getting on the gatwick express or otherwise travelling through victoria station will be coming back ,1
very good food every time when i go around victoria i go and eat there book your table before you visit the restaurant as it get busy ,1
we went before seeing hamilton as the set menu looked great the staff were friendly and they amended our set menu to include veggie options liked the bibimbap served in hot stone bowls incredible dumblings and green tea good value good spot ,1
took a lunchtime meal for 8 here service was efficient and friendly as i d expect from koreans having visited korea on business i was always sceptical that food and ambiance could be emulated just outside london s busy transport hun at victoria i m very pleased to say that the korean owners have done a fantastic job the food was fantastic and a sufficient variety to give choice without compromising on quality freshness and time from order to table the venue is plain simple no nonsense intimate social dining definitely worth a visit and really good value in my opinion,1
really nice staff that sorted our table as soon as they were able to even though the place was packed plus the food was so delicious and lovely would definitely come back ,1
a group of friends and i visited here when we were seeing a show at the victoria and wanted a quick bite we re very glad we did as its a lovely place with a friendly feel to the service and great food they catered well for my many dietary needs and gluten free is marked on the menu go hungry as the portions were large i recommend the citrus tea we arrived at around 6 and got a table but even on a monday evening in january it was soon packed ,1
we were looking for a place around victoria that wasn t a bland chain and fortunately found this every dish was delicious the chicken wings are amongst the best i ve ever had and the bibimbap was fantastic if you are going to eat here make sure you go before the show rush or book in advance you have to book at least the day before as there were queues out the door as we finished ,1
lime orange was a superb find we had possibly one of the best korean meals i have tasted outside of south korea lime ornage does not take reservations and it is clear why the restaurant is packed from opening until closing with queues out into the street throughout the evening tables are jam packed into this tiny restaurant with hardly any space between them to squeeze into but nobody minds being a little close to the next table of diners in an ultra busy restaurant where the service never falters and the food is exquisite lime orange is situated directly opposite the apollo victoria where wicked has been playing for the past several years it is a block from victoria railway station two blocks from hm passport office and three blocks from buckingham palace so there is no end of potential passing trade lime orange is a family owned and run business and so service and food quality are given the highest priorities no matter how busy the staff were they remained attentive and friendly we will definitely return in the future ,1
waited for 20 mins for a table which was fine as we didn t book and it s quite a small restaurant delicious starters calamari some of the best we ve had tasty mains beef staff are busy but polite and friendly reasonably priced would recommend top marks,1
truly excellent experience booked for lunch in this cosy and friendly restaurant prior to seeing hamilton welcoming atmosphere good straightforward korean menu very good food truly excellent service with timely warning about meal delay recommend highly ,1
what a gem this restaurant is found it looking for something close to wicked noticed don t take bookings from 6pm so booked for 5 30pm which proved ingenious seeing queues out on the street great vibe staff very helpful and attentive food just superb gluten free options can t fault highly recommend,1
visited pre theatre and weren t disappointed we both went for the set meal number 2 which was gorgeous plenty of food good value and friendly staff one slight criticism it felt like we were being rushed as the main meal was served before we d finished our starter well worth a visit though ,1
chose this restaurant as it was within walking distance to our hotel and based on tripadvisor recommendations this is a small floorplan with very limited seating and we had to wait on the sidewalk fortunately less than ten minutes before being seated as there is not a waiting area reservations are strongly recommended my spouse had the beef bulgogi and i had the bullgogi hot pot rice and sides were all extra and not included food was good and the hotpot was excellent for the cold damp evening ,1
great food helpful service big portions reasonable prices popped in for lunch before checking into our hotel absolutely delicious ,1
booked a table for friday night for 4 people definitely book as restaurant was totally full all evening and people waiting outside enjoyable food and very generous portions very nice service didn t feel rushed worth noting they didn t take cards the evening we visited so needed to go out for cash will definitely return,1
i made a reservation for 2 people by calling the day earlier i turned up the next day on time but the whole restaurant was packed and not a single table was empty i informed them of my reservation and the 2 staff didn t seem to be aware of the reservation so i was made to wait for 5 6 mins while they cleared up a table for me we ordered the following to about 45 veg mandu not tasty just average but the apple cide vinegar dip was nice spicy calamari the best dish of everything we had the sauce is sweet spicy pa jeon seafood pancake was tasty as well kimchi fried rice shouldn t have ordered this as it was bland and the kimchi wasn t as spicy or tasty served with a lovely miso soup however chicken spicy noodles had a spicy taste and the chicken tasted good very generous portions of the rice and noodles we were sated at the end the mains were disappointing but the starters were good would prolly order their popular bibimbap next time the staff were friendly and the service was quick considering the crowded place however i felt that 2 people are not enough to run the service and reception definitely need another pair of hands on a busy afternoon ,0
great food great service and reasonable prices in london right next to victoria station this place is gold food was delicious and the staff were on hand to help you with the menu and make recommendations if required bibimbap is excellent and very authentic ,1
we went on a busy saturday evening about 18 30 the place was almost full but we were seated quickly and took time to look at the amazing food other people were eating we ordered a starter and main course each and were more than satisfied with the portion sizes the spicy calamari and pa jeon pancake starters were very good and no sooner had we finished than the main courses arrived my wife loved the chicken bimimbap and for me the beef bulgogi with lettuce and rice was truly delicious we had a kimchee cucumber and pear salad with the mains and that was outstanding fresh and delicious it s a shame the korean beer was tasteless but everything else was great and the young staff were really helpful and friendly recommended ,1
the fact this restaurant is always packed for dinner service speaks volume good quality korean food for a reasonable price in a great location very friendly service and although the restaurant frequently has a queue it seems to move quickly ,1
nice stuff good foods the portions are larhe do not try a ramen and a bibimbap for one it was too much but you can ask for takeaway everything was very delicious you can pay by card kedves személyzet finom ételek az adagok nagyok ne akarj rament és bibimbapot enni egyszerre egy embernek túl sok de elcsomagolják minden nagyon finom volt és lehet kártyával fizetni ,1
we called to book only to be told dont worry plenty of tables arrived 15 mins later none available luckily for us a table didn t turn up so we got it never eaten korean before didn t really know what to order everyone around us had mountains of food that looked amazing went for a few starters and beef bullogi for main so tasty unfortunately nothing we ordered looked like what the other diners were eating but nevertheless what we got was great we asked the waitress for a few dishes pointing out some other tables but due to the language barrier she didn t really understand what we meant chopsticks and a spoon for the soup i guess no other cutlery we used the chopsticks for about 5 mins then gave up and went for the spoon feeling a little silly as everyone else using them with ease tables a little sticky reasonably priced food would definitely go again very tasty food i just wish we could have tried more next time ,1
on a saturday evening without reservation we tried our luck we looked inside from the window it looked packed with a party of three already waiting we were immediately welcome by a waiter who told us 5 minutes and shorter than that a table became free and we had our place the dishes came surprisingly fast and were simply delicious and authentic we have extensive travel experience to korea we loved the katsu the bibimbab the bulgogis they even import a korean beer despite the hectic of a saturday night the staff was all calm efficient and very personal and friendly the prices are reasonable overall a great family run establishment that we can warmly recommend ,1
very good modest korean restaurant i ordered a korean soup and the dish was so large that it would be enough for the whole lunch or dinner,1
great food and service i m very happy to have found this lovely korean restaurant it s close to both the apollo palace theatres but i strongly suggest booking ahead if you want to go pre theatre not on the day as they don t take same day bookings we were just lucky they found a table for us plave was very full even though 6pm i m looking forward to coming back trying some other things on the menu ,1
went there with some friends before going to the theatre we had booked which was just as well as it got very busy and by the time we left at 6 30 people were queuing outside we were not sure what to order so in the end went for some starters and one main course which was plenty between the 4 of us the tempura prawns were amazing and the calamari in the sticky sweet and sour sauce was amazing the staff were really nice very cheerful and helpful highly recommended,1
absolutely fabulous food amazing value for money evidenced by the queue waiting outside worthwhile booking in advance make sure you have cash as they don t take cards would recommend beef bulgogi ,1
this is a busy small place that is a few minutes walk from victoria station the service is attentive and swift i loved the advice to newcomers like me so that i didn t fall foul of the super hot spicy sauce the food was served quickly and was really tasty and there was plenty of it two beers two starters and two main courses for 50 what s not to love,1
we were a really large group nearly 20 people about half of whom were korean they were really impressed it was excellent food and completely unpretentious really good value it s a popular place and gets very busy highly recommended ,1
i ended up going here twice on my most recent visit to london once of my own volition and again on the recommendation of a friend i wasn t complaining the first time i had the tofu salad and jeon both ok for vegans although a couple more members of staff could do with knowing what is and isn t vegan on their menu these choices were decent if a little greasy the second time when i went back i had the tofu bibimbap and that was pretty impressive the restaurant is very close to victoria station and not all that expensive it was packed both nights and i would go again ,1
a colleague recommended this place as i was meeting a friend straight from work and it was close by given that we went on a monday evening and were starving at 6 30 we figured it would be pretty quiet there but the place was heaving always a good sign we had one of the set menus and i have to say it was all delicious the staff were all friendly and realised that we hadn t had korean food before so explained how we were supposed to assemble one of the dishes we d have worked it out but was nice to be helped my only slight negative point was that the tea was very weak i had the korean tea which had some flavour but my friend had the green tea and said that it tasted of nothing but hot water i will definitely be back,1
what to say other than this place exceeds expectations i m very difficult to please when it comes to eating out and really struggled to choose from the menu as everything sounded good the staff were brilliant giving us time and answering many questions i was recommended the kimchi soup which comes with rice others had the noodles or bibimbap when they arrived portions were huge but with lots of flavour the bibimbaps were incredible but i think the kimchi soup won hands down hot spicy and full of ingredients i can t wait to come back to have it again can t stress enough how great this place is ,1
we arrived early but still had to wait about 20 mins for a table since it s quite a small restaurant the food was slightly too salty but the bibimbap was tasty as a whole ,0
never eaten korean before this is a popular place and i can see why food is great and the service was good too great selection on the menu will definitely be back booking is essential was full seconds after it opened at 12 00 ,1
was looking for somewhere to eat before going to see hamilton and stumbled across lime orange on tripadvisor we booked by phone the day before and were glad we did we arrived just after 5 30pm and by 6pm they had a queue outside we shared a number of starters including chilli chicken wings and the giant prawns we then tried the bibimbap and beef bulogi with lettuce and rice both fantastic friendly staff quick service amazing food highly recommended ,1
we were running very late for grabbing a pre theatre meal saw this restaurant directly opposite apollo victoria theatre was busy so assumed it must be good food we weren t disappointed we d never eaten korean before so asked the young waiter what we should order but also explained to him our time restriction we only had approx 40 mins to be in out he recommended a few dishes for us and assured they d be with us within 15 mins very impressive service and food ,1
we needed to find food quite quickly in the victoria area a look on ta and we decided on this place no regrets ambience busy tight packed bustling eatery first thing we noticed lots of koreans always a good sign when people recognise their own cuisine service despite pressure friendly and attentive very good food outstanding we had seafood bibimbap for me and chicken katsu with udon noodles for her but we shared each other s both very good the bibimbap possible the more interesting and in its massive stone bowl stayed piping hot for ever drink a had hite beer fine with the food value good we felt given location 31 68 inc pre included service charge the tip would have been bigger if it hadn t been included verdict i want to go back ,1
first time having korean food and ill definatley go back food was amazing and just the right portion size the waiting staff were fantastic made me and my friend feel welcome and couldnt do enough the guy who i think was manager was excellent well manerd polite and courtious overall excellent i will make sure i tell all my friends family and collegues to visit in my opinion a hidden gem reqlly enjoyed,1
i ve actually been a couple of times since my last visit it is really good chicken bibimbap excellent busy as usual pleasant service quick very reasonably priced well deserving its loyal clientele ,1
the food is excellent highly recommend the spicy fried chicken and seafood pancake as starter every dish is amazing and worth its price definitely will visit again ,1
great little korean restaurant with helpful staff just outside victoria station isn t the biggest and you can t make same day reservation so be prepared for a wait but the food is worth it ,1
everything pictured below cost around 33 including drinks the picing is incredibly good the only downside was that we were a party of two who wanted to order the bbq but could only do so if we ordered 3 persons worth of food my friend and i wanted to try a variety of foods so opted for a shared selection the ttoboki was incredibly tasty but as avid spicy food hotpot eaters it was not spicy enough when i return i plan to ask for it to be spicier the staff were incredibly nice specially the young man who served us we order just before the place became busy and eventhough the place was packed he was still incredibly polite and full of smiles as we sat down he offered to put our suitcases and bags outback we didn t catch his name but we arrived at the place on the 03 06 and would really like to praise him for his servicing ,1
we booked a table for 4 before going to see bts at wembley stadium and had a great time the staff were very friendly attentive both over the phone and in person the food was incredible full of flavour free ingredients and presented very well they also played great and recent k pop music which was a real treat for us the place was very busy so book in advance if going on a saturday like we did would highly recommend going here ,1
the food simply is truly amazing and authentic korean after spending more than 6 weeks in south korea back in 2002 and loving it i have been trying to find their great flavours everywhere never could until i found lime orange in london a true trip to the south korean kitchen ,1
after reading the reviews and having walked past the customers queuing up outside for quite some time we went for dinner we came early and managed to get seated with no wait you can only make a reservation if you plan on dining two or more days out the inside is very small service was very attentive for starters we had soy chicken and the cucumber kimchee both were excellent for mains we had the beef bibimbap and the beef bulgogi both were mediocre no real flavor very disappointing if we do go back it won t be anytime soon ,0
great little place after checking a number of web sites we visited this little gem food delicious fresh service very good and it was packed with people from way before 7pm suggest you visit expecting a short wait but well worth it ,1
perfectly located for the apollo theatre wicked this is a great place for a pre show meal they open at 5 and when we arrived at about 5 past there were already 2 tables seated by half past the restaurant was full and people were waiting we were asked if we had a reservation which we didn t and i would certainly recommend booking if planning to arrive any later than we did the food was well explained on the menu and the friendly staff were on hand to help make recommendations service was extremely quick in fact we were in and out in just over an hour and the food is all brought out as soon as it is ready without a clear gap between courses this might bother some people but i didn t feel like we were being rushed the food itself was beautifully presented and of good quality having not tried korean food before i found the flavours a little disappointing slightly bland compared to some other asian cuisines but i think that s more personal taste overall i would definitely recommend the place for a value for money pre show meal if you like asian food ,1
looking for a restaurant near victoria we came across this one a bit of a wait but well worth the wait for nice korean food will be back ,1
it is a tiny place and there was a bit of a wait when we arrived but staff was very professional and handled the situation well when the food arrived it was so delicious it was definitely worth a wait good choice of vegetarian dishes i had kimchee jeon and kimchee bibimbap i have a serous kimchee obsession lately and it was yum my meet eating companion loved his spicy calamari and seafood udon we also had some korean plum wine for the first time and it was distinctly different to japanese variety we are familiar with but equally delightful altogether great meal and excellent value highly recommended ,1
came here for dinner prior to going to see wicked at the apollo the food was brilliant it tasted amazing and was well presented the staff were friendly and polite too i would definitely recommend this restaurant and would eat here again ,1
we called in for a quick dinner for 5 people before seeing a 7 30pm wicked show staff were super fast food was amazing and the portions were huge great value meals ,1
great find close to the station and some bars looks smaller from the outside but seats a decent number of people casual restaurant perfect for a small group of friends fabulous food and cheap at around 25 per head with just one alcoholic drink not a place i d take young children in buggies as space is tight though they had barbecue heaters but they didn t turn them on for us because it was so busy instead they cooked it in the kitchen and brought it out but that worked for us would definitely go again if in the area ,1
whilst my stay in hong kong i ve had my fair share of korean food the bibimbap i tried was definitely authentic like they say it is will be trying out the other dishes as the bulgogi looked good too recommenced to book as it is a relatively small restaurant ,1
we were looking for something different as we were down in london for the theatre and the lime orange reviews convinced us to book we arrived at 5 as it was opening and the staff were lounging about in the dining area so not really a great first impression as a vegetarian the choice was limited so i had the tofu udon and the ladies had chicken katsu udon the noodles were barely warm and generally the meal was bland and uninteresting the people on the table across looked to have made a better choice with a colourful rice dish perhaps our fault but if experimenting with somewhere for the first time in future i will be asking for recommendations and help from the staff serving ,1
we dropped in for a quick bite before seeing hamilton in march 2019 we were able to sit at a 4 person bbq table although there were only 2 of us and ordered the pre requisite 3 bbq dishes as a result it was quiet when we arrived just before 6pm but filled up really quickly excellent friendly service with helpful tips really delicious food a fun experience bbq ing on the griddle in the centre of the table and very reasonabe in price would recommend book in advance ,1
i went there with 2 friends of mine and we went to try korean food for the first time together it was really tasty and we ended up leaving with perfectly full and satisfied stomachs also the staff were really educated and even guided us through the mixing of bibimbap which we were really pleased about i m thinking about going there soon in the future ,1
the only reason i didn t give lime orange five stars is because our soup was not hot other than that the food was excellent ,0
i had a bibimbap and it was delicious well presented and i got a really good sized portion 10 the staff were friendly and we were able to sit at the table for a while even though they were full i would definitely recommend booking ahead the only slight downfall is that it s a bit dark inside and the decor could do with a few finishing touches ,1
small restaurant with close tables menu ok but food disappointing starter was ok it the main course lukewarm and somewhat lacking staff not that friendly ice cream pretty good though difficult to give a positive recommendation ,0
fantastic restaurant great interior very relaxed and really nice food staff are friendly and always happy to help great value for money ,1
excellent korean restaurant polite and efficient service the food is amazing absolutely recommend it ,1
walked past this restaurant every day without a 2nd glance for 8 years today gave it a try before going to a show all i can say is i wished i d paid more notice years ago ,1
first time here bit of a queue outside but they took my number while we popped down to weatherspoons for a cheeky glass of wine the food was really interesting and tasted fabulous really enjoyed and would comeback again staff were really friendly and service was good ,1
lime orange is an excellent pre theatre restaurant choice very reasonably priced and beautiful tasting high quality food never having eaten korean food before the staff we very helpful and informative advising on the best dishes to try we had delicious pa jeon to start followed by beef bibimbap and pork belly i cannot recommend this delightful family run restaurant highly enough i understand why lime orange don t take bookings between 18 00 19 30 so my tip is to get there early 17 30 latest if you want to get a table and enjoy this delicious food without being too rushed a queue developed at times but was quite fast moving ,0
great place to go before seeing hamilton food was excellent in good portions and reasonable for london would definitely go again you need to book though as it s not a big place ,1
we happened across this restaurant after the hamilton matinee show at the victoria palace theatre we hadn t booked and it was really busy but we were seated within 15 minutes we chose the set menu with vegetable dumplings as starter bibimbap with chicken and miso soup a glass of house wine and a green or korean tea it was 20 a head excellent food and flavours and very friendly staff well worth a visit but book a table if you can ,1
wanted a non chain restaurant and happened to walk past looked in looked okay and decided to try it 1st time korean for me and had the seafood bibimap generous with the ingredients very tasty and chilli to taste take care with the squirty chilli pot next table s bbq looked good will go again ,1
congested place and to be honest the food was also not good since i am a vegetarian i tried one of the vegetarian options those were limited too but it wasn t tasty at all the staff was friendly and service was good ,1
we ate there yesterday and were not impressed a small uncomfortable restaurant where we were crammed in like cattle the 2 starters and the main s all arrived at the same time one of the chicken wing starters actually oozed blood when you bit into it bloody hazardous to health on complaining they took 3 50 of the price of the wings would not recomend at all ,0
my team and i are regular visitors here at lunch time as we work in the area we all love this place the staff are very friendly the food is good and great value the restaurant is quite small and is always busy so booking is recommended for parties of 4 at peak times despite being always busy they take the orders and serve the food fairly quickly our favourite dish is the bibimbap a korean rice dish served in a bowl that it is so hot that anything that touches it sizzles for minutes they have different options and i have personally tried this with tofu kimchee and seafood but they also have meaty options like chicken and beef if you order a bibimbap you get a miso soup included in the price 10 too it s difficult to find a better restaurant in the victoria station area ,1
visited lime orange last night and would highly recommend it to anybody service was excellent and food was beautiful ,1
in the tourist trap zone adjacent to victoria station remarkable to find this genuinely good reasonably priced authentic korean restaurant packed with koreans to underline that seafood korean pancake very good an excellent chicken bimimbap nice squid a good seafood bibimbap as well water 40 in total very nice service i seriously rated it ,1
we stopped here for lunch awaiting a bus from victoria food was very good service was quick despite being fairly busy prices reasonable ,1
we happened to run into this little restaurant that had three spaces on a bar overlooking the street great food wonderful service would go again if staying longer ,1
came here for a post theatre meal the starters of chicken katsu and spicy calamari were both great ways to kick things off with flavourful and large portions but the mains were a bit of a let down in comparison i had the beef bibimbap and my friend had the seafood bibimbap whilst both were pleasant and interesting for a pair of korean food novices neither dish was particularly memorable or packed a real punch on the flip side the service was attentive and informative throughout i d definitely come back again if only to try something different as again all in all our meal was decent ,1
i ve been to this restaurant about five times over the last year or so and i can confidently say the the following three things have been consistent every time the food was nice enough the price was more than i d expect the service was rushed and bordering unpleasant i can explain a little more on points 1 2 the food is ok authentic can t say nice enough yes but overpriced within a few minutes walk of this place you can have the same quality korean food at a much reasonable price on point 3 the space is very limited and that s fine but to be asked to wait until the rest of your party arrives before you are given a table because they don t want to lose a seat is not something i want to do to me that tells me i am valued less than the restaurant selling a table seat i accept that this could be perfectly fine for many but is not for me overall average is the best i can give this place and i m aiming not to visit again ,0
went there last night prior to a show arrived just at the right time as 10 mins later there was a throng of people waiting to get in superb ,1
very good portions and a good selections of starters the kimchi was just ok but the bibimbap i had was really yummy the dumplings were tasty too ,1
this is such a nice place to enjoy good food in the heart of victoria the restaurant has a very nice menu with very generous portions and a very good price quality balance the staff members really give me that feeling that they are genuinely enjoining working there i m very glad to have find this place and i will certainly recommend it upon any other nearby chain restaurants as i definitely think that central london lacks in this type of restaurants which truly deserve to be recognised and promoted a very satisfying experience ,1
i came her with some friends for lunch and the place was really crowded however the owner was able to find a table for us the food was really tasty and price honest for the quality and the location we shared some starters and i loved my main course seafood noodles i will eat here again to try other options of their menu ,1
i went there with my daughter and her partner for a family get together before christmas i was very impressed with the service and the quality of the food we had prawns and squid to start followed by the table bbq of chicken pork and beef with lettuce to wrap plenty of kimchi and hite beer it was a real treat would definitely return ,1
and oh so good food was very delicious and full of flavor great for a pre theatre meal go early as it can become loud ,1
my korean friend brought me here for a healthy wholesome meal between the kimchi felrmented vegetables and the dumplings the lovely soups with beef fish pork which neveer get cold as they are served in special font pots and great spices sweet as well as spicy and the famous korean bbq we were really spoiled for choice this is a small restuarant so dont expect luxury but the service is quick and efficient as well as polite ,1
came here on a friday evening was already full so had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table they don t take bookings between certain times but was the wait worth it it s quite a small restaurant with quite closely packed tables but we felt this added to the atmosphere the service was friendly and efficient and the menu has a great choice of both meat and vegetarian options the food we tried was all delicious and reasonably priced they also do takeaway it s good to know before you go that this place is cash only will definitely return ,1
delicious food and excellent service especially considering it was a crazy busy saturday night we would definitely recommend it ,1
came as a recommendation from a friend was absolutely not disappointed the service was fast the food was delicious and felt freshly prepared the quantity was good and felt value for money very knowledgable and attentive staff would absolutely make the trip to go again i had the beef bulgogi kimchi and korean tea with rice and lettuce even though it was a rainy day the line was out the door and it was busy i look forward to finding my next excuse to make the trip to return there ,1
went in for lunch and it was the best and lowest cost meal of our 4 day trip they have a daily special which is only 5 90 to eat in it was a soup with dumplings and very nice we also had the most delicious chicken wings katsu chicken with udon noodles a portion of rice kimchi and a big bottle of water and it was just under 35 including a service charge service was quick strongly recommend,1
we ve eaten bibimbaps and bulgogis all over korea so we were delighted to find that lime orange was absolutely bang on in being authentically delicious with me loving my pork bibimbap and my wife loving her beef bulgogi mine had lovely tasty fluffy rice with 7 or 8 different types of steamed vegetable pork that had been marinated in a delicious sesame y marinade and a little bowl of miso soup on the side while my wife s dinner consisted of a beautiful fragrant soup with delicious marinated beef in it with a bowl of that lovely rice on the side i was also delighted to see they serve makgeolli that lovely korean light rice wine the place was absolutely heaving with a queue of people out the door many or whom were koreans though we only had to wait 10 mins or so to be seated the service was quick and friendly and we left 40 mins later with smiles on our faces it is cash only at lime orange but there s an atm right across the road we will most definitely be back ,1
this small clean friendly place is perfect for a pre hamilton or whatever show you are seeing at the palace repas korean food can be light even vegetarian spicy or not depending on your preference and the kimchee won t upset the people sitting next to you in the theatre i had udon noodles supposedly spicy they weren t piquant but they were fresh and umami my friend had bibimbap with tofu both dishes were generous and filling we shared kimchee pancakes like potato pancakes but crunchier service was unobtrusive and efficient arrive early for pre theatre because it gets crowded the closer you get to show time ,1
i love this place bustling and friendly with super spicy tasy warming authentic korean chow bulgogi bibimbap kimchee and lots more beside always makes me leave happy and replete try the korean beer too recommended whole heartedly ,1
ate here last friday and it was out of this world soo tasty and generous portions came as it was close to the theatre and we had look at reviews beforehand it did not disappoint would definitely go back if in the area,1
you need to get there early to avoid having to queue but the food is excellent and the service is quick and friendly an ideal place to go for a pre theatre meal ,1
went for dinner with my husband and ordered cucumber kimchee beef bimbibap spicy chicken bulgogi kimchee jigae ramen we love the cucumber kimchee and beef bimbibap but the chicken and ramen was too spicy for us however some people might like the spicyness so this is relative the atmosphere is typical asian cafe place but it did feel a bit cramp but i think that is because the restaurant was trying to pack as many seats as possible to maximum sales which is understandable the service was good and the staff was friendly also this place only take cash so bear that in mind in summary this is definitely an option for a pre theatre meal and i would go back again if i am around the neighbourhood and if i crave for asian food ,1
great food good service and no line before show in october but it was completely full when i left at 7 pm the bibimbap is great and plenty of food would not have had room for appetizer though they looked stellar on other tables,0
stopped by after a matinee it s across the street from the apollo victoria and we were told there d be an hour wait we put our name down in the queue and 20 minutes later we got a call saying a table was ready we were only a few minutes away arrived quickly and were seated in the back of the room the vegetable mandu and the chicken bibimbap were good and coupled with a great show the food helped make it a good day ,1
we had a great dinner after arriving to london on a late train from the airport very close to victoria station great korean food tasty and abundant really nice service although the kitchen was about to close surely coming back ,1
really good bibimbap my friend had bulgogi also great small restaurant near a few theaters so it was very crowded when we arrived and had a line out the door soon afterward but worth the crowds and the wait in my opinion black sesame ice cream for dessert was unusual and delicious ,1
i came here because of the reviews and wasn t let down the food was great and was authentically korean the bibimbap was exactly as i had in seoul and i was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of the kimchi as well as the size of the dishes it isn t michelin star dining but i m glad it s not the service was really good and it is excellent value for london i ll be back here ,1
we ordered 2 noodles and some starters and they were tasty the staff were very friendly too as we stayed there a good 2 hours after we finished our meals and they never chased us away ,1
we had the beef bulgogi pork bibimbap and chicken katsu udon and they were all delicious and generously sized mains are under 10 which feels like good value for the quality and location right by victoria station and the theatres showing hamilton and wicked service very friendly too ,1
the restaurant is conveniently located less than 5 minutes walking from victoria train coach underground station so it s a busy area but the restaurant itself is away from most of the footfall while we were there however at around 7pm midweek the restaurant was consistently busy with a constant stream of diners it s pretty small and quite cramped and it was slightly uncomfortable having the waiting diners practically hanging over our table so ideally they should carve out a space for waiting but then they d lose a table and welcome income i imagine that said the food was great not quite up there with kimchi in holborn but far cheaper good portion sizes a really good selection on the menu was pleased to see a tofu bibimbap for veggies the kimchi wasn t quite spicy enough for our liking and the mandu dumplings were only lukewarm but these are mild complaints and all was worth it for the delicious bibimbaps which we spent an hour over scraping the burnt rice from the bottom of the stone bowl don t judge it s the best part the service was also very friendly all the servers were smiley and helpful if a little rushed overall i would recommend a visit to lime orange with friends for something quite quick or even alone at the window bench but probably not for a romantic meal or for somewhere to relax with drinks for a while ,1
we d been to the nearby victoria palace theatre we saw this place on trip advisor and had booked a table for after the show just as well as it was really popular the food was really tasty and service was really quick it s a small place and they clearly want to turn the tables quickly so not a place for leisurely meal nb cash only a great find ,1
this is a little gem near to the apollo victoria every dish was well presented and made like korean food should be it s small and cramped but for a meal its great service is friendly caution is advised since while we were there someone two tables down by the door had their cell phone stolen by a beggar who covered it with a piece of paper before making a sharp exit ,1
we were lucky enough to get hamilton tickets at the victoria theatre lime orange is literally 3 mins walk away food was great we shared two starters prawns and calamari then each had a main and the grownups tried the korea beer great service food and value we were in and out within an hour which suited us ,1
came here for a casual meal with a friend who s quite a foodie based on reviews and the apparent halal options available there is a sign in the window saying the chicken is halal and the member of the waiting staff that i asked said the same we hadn t booked and managed to get a table but it turns out we definitely should have if we were planning on coming a bit later we got there a little before 18 30 i think the restaurant got packed pretty quickly but not in chaotic manner and the service we received was very friendly and helpful throughout as i said in the title the yangyeum chicken which we shared for starters was very tasty and the batter was crispy for mains i went for the spicy chicken bulgogi with lettuce and rice and my friend went for the beef bibimbap which comes with rice i enjoyed my dish even if i struggled a little at first with how to eat it the waiter did very politely give me advice when they served it and my friend described their course as okay i d say i m less fussy than them p but if they say it s okay it s good for me and if they say it s amazing it s really good for me tables were generally clean though one or two spots seemed a little sticky and the toilets well i can only comment on the men s seemed to be kept in good condition food was served fairly promptly and despite how busy it was getting with people waiting to be seated we were never made to feel rushed or anything like that it s not that expensive but i think if it were a little cheaper i d be likely to come back here for a quick bite if i were in the area p,1
met an american friend visiting near victoria for dinner although they do not take reservations between 6 and 8 pm i called during the day and while they made no promises they had a table waiting for us which was great the mandu bimbibap and bulgogi were all excellent the hite beer cold and fresh all this for 45 for two it s not a fancy place but definitely authentic attentive service as well ,1
an unexpected delight very close to victoria station which is otherwise surrounded by chain franchise eateries cosy homely atmosphere very friendly service and the food was yummy my nieces and i ordered a couple of starters and a couple of main dishes incl the beef bibimbap which was recommended to us by someone waiting for her takeaway there was more than enough to share and we thoroughly enjoyed it it was my first time at a korean restaurant and i would definitely go again but please check the state of your bathrooms regularly ,0
i cannot recommend this restaurant enough firstly the food was to die for so we ordered the tofu udon the salmon teriyaki korean bbq beef and a bibimbap and every single one of us adored the food each dish was exceptional the tofu was the best tofu i have ever eaten it was just delicious it s a really cosy restaurant and because everyone is sitting quite close together you become quite friendly with the people around you if you want to the price is very reasonable as well considering it s in central london everyone has to visit this place we love it ,1
came here for a post theatre meal great food and good service even though it was packed and we had to squeeze onto a small table ,1
we had a pre hamilton lunch fantastic korean food great starters a must try is the cucumber pear kimchi service was courteous food came fairly quick quite a useful tip it s also 5mins from victoria station we ll be back ,1
i ve been to lime orange several times now and always get the chicken bibimbap and have never been disappointed the dish is hearty hot and full of flavour i could eat it over and over again the atmosphere in the restaurant is cosy and always full of people the service is good some improvements could be made when it comes to the waiters and how they deliver the food on the table especially as the dishes are so hot apart from that no complaints ,1
given the good reviews we were looking forward to this for a pre hamilton meal but we were disappointed on a very hot night we tried to go for a light option of sharing several starters but everything came deep fried and not particularly tasty won t go again,0
we chose this place because it was close to the apollo victoria theatre we were having dinner before going to see wicked my kids also wanted korean food i thought the food was ok frankly i think we get better korean food in toronto it was just different i was surprised that the side dishes weren t included even kim chee we had to pay separately again this just might be the way it is in london back home it is all include in the meal my wife thought her salmon was done very well ,1
visited this restaurant again as from my friend request we were enjoyed the first time this time we ordered similar dishes cucumber kimchi and set menu when we asked for some raw garlic and chilli sauce like last time the waiter said they don t have any raw garlic and chilli sauce really korean restaurant don t have raw garlic and chilli sauce it s traditional way to eat the bulgogi beef with raw garlic wrap with lettuce sounds like this time we walked in to the wrong restaurant ,0
stopped here before going theatre lovely food nice ppl nice taste of korea wish it was a little bigger would definitely go again,1
this small family run restaurant located near victoria station features largely korean or korean japanese fusion food that is well prepared tasty and affordable we had fried tofu statter and soya chcken starter i have had the fried tofu starter before and it was excellent tonight it was just ok but the soy chicken was excellent succulent fleash indide crispy on the outside and rich with umami flavours for the main course we each had the soecialty stone bowl meal called bibimbap mine was beef my friends was chicken seven vegitables are combined with the meat of your choice and rice and this is cooked in a hot stone bowl miso soup is served alongside hint pour the miso into the bowl to sizzle off the rice from the bottom of the bowl excellent tasty dish dinner for two including two starteres one side dish two main dishes and two beers came to under 50 ,1
stopped in here before seeing wicked the food was great and reasonably priced for the area around 7 12 pounds for a main staff were also very friendly and the service was fast would definitely recommend ,1
visited this restaurant before wicked came around 17 30 and 2 tables were taken it was getting busier around 18 15 very nice and delicious food nicely served in hot pot quick service around 35gbp for 2 starters and main meal to share with drinks recommended ,1
a small restaurant the service was quick and attentive we ate the cucumber kimchi which was excellent it contained thin slices of apple very refreshing for main course we ate the pork bipimpap and beef hot pot bulgogi also very good the price was very reasonable all and all an excellent experience i highly recommend ,1
just stopped by for a quick launch the service was very good the food came out fast and the food was excellent,1
went in for lunch and had an amazing time recommending getting menu number 3 if you are really hungry however getting a bibimbap per person will suffice,0
we discovered this place by mistake while we were waiting the train to the airport and since then it s a must in london if we have visitors we always recommend them to go this place the bibimbap is amazing and you should try at least one starter i would recommend to anyone this place if you re in the area ,1
a real gem of a place near the apollo victoria and victoria place theatres we got there at 5pm and by 6pm there was a queue food was excellent and i enjoyed the korean beer well recommended,1
a smallish korean restaurant that serves healthy meals with fresh ingredients the daily lunch specials are value for money if you want to give yourself a treat go for the different choices of bibimbap which comes sizzling in a hot stone bowl i like it that you can add the chilly sauce according to your taste top off your meal with a bottle of korean beer ,1
located bang opposite the apollo victoria ideal for a pre theatre dinner it was quiet when we arrived but quickly filled up our food was delicious interesting korean food which our waiter explained the best way to eat it we ordered a cucumber side dish which we didn t really enjoy however when the bill came we were not charged for this the waiter said he tasted it himself when he saw we had left most of it and he said it had not been prepared correctly so we were not charged great customer service recommended,1
we loved this meal and we liked the atmosphere a lot it was so busy and the staff were super quick we did have to ask to order for drinks and to pay but that wasn t a problem the food was good and the service was quick ,1
husband amd i wanted to try something new and decided on lime orange based on reviews really glad we did the food was very good it came quickly and was reasonably priced the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is very tight placement of tables so there is no privacy because the neighboring table is literally a foot away from yours and it was also pretty loud a great place to meet with friends but probably not the best choice for a romantic or intimate meal ,1
first time visit the restaurant after the show walk in early hours friendly greetings from the staff dishes were good portion tasty too seats are comfortable even in a small place even the price is really reasonable price ,1
we were so lucky to get a table here almost as soon as we walked in they were packed we had a show to see across the street at apollo victoria and were unfortunately a little short on time service was quick and friendly and the food came out fresh hot and absolutely delicious i haven t had korean food very often but lime orange is the best i ve had the spicy calamari we tried as a starter had a couple of pieces that were a little chewy but most were just about perfect i really liked their kimchi too i had chicken katsu udon and the chicken was crisp moist and the sauce was very good the noodles and vegetables perfectly cooked in my opinion my husband had the pork belly bulgogi with fresh lettuce leaves and he loved it the portion sizes seemed very generous to us and we both had to leave some on our plates leaving full and satisfied with our dinner it is a small place maybe a bit cramped if you re a bit of a larger build and they were completely full our entire visit i imagine they often are i m not familiar with meal prices in london but we felt that they were very reasonable i highly recommend lime orange and both my husband and i would happily return on another visit to london ,1
this is the second time i ve visited like before i let a family member order on my behalf as i m not au fait with korean dishes the food and service were excellent we really enjoyed our meal i said in my last review that i d return again and two years later i did no doubt i ll be back again one day ,1
if you want to try authentic korean food lime orange is the place to come the food is great the service is friendly and it is excellent value too try the calamari starter its gorgeous the spicy chicken noodles are delicious also careful though they really are spicy ,1
ordered a take away to collect and have to say the prawns and squid starter were excellent great enough to make you want to return to then restaurant the kim gui was just ok for me the chilli chicken and the chicken katsu udon didn t travel well the chilli chicken lacked some umph and the katsu just needed some more sauce or jus or something to help it along i think this would be much better in the restaurant the starters were truly tasty and i think the katsu will be better so although only a 3 5 i would go to the restaurant to try it out,1
on a visit to london we wanted to try something different lime orange was fantastic i had never heard of bimbimbap but it turned out to be delicious i shared with my grandson while himself had marinated steak great wine friendly and excellent service and good prices we arrived around 5 30pm the place very quickly filled up we look forward to our next visit ,1
visited with friends yesterday for dinner it was amazing delicious food lovely ambience and very helpful staff food taste is very good with nice presentation highly recommendable if you looking for korean food in london it s best in london five stars for everything ,1
i ll be honest we weren t supposed to be going to lime orange our first choice was closed but my colleague loves korean food and suggested lime orange and what a great second choice from the outside lime orange doesn t look much but at 615 on a monday evening it was almost full and tables filled as soon as they became free people obviously knew something we didn t service was prompt and friendly and the food was excellent this was my first korean meal so my colleague ordered two different bulgogi and some side dishes and i was instantly hooked fresh tasty well prepared and super tasty and very reasonable at 25 for more than enough food washed down with a korean hite beer each such an unexpected gem amidst the tourist rip offs in the area ,1
great little pre theatre spot amazing bibimbap and great service reasonably priced and the portions were huge would highly recommend ,1
very charming restaurant with real korean food even with teenagers a good choice the team is very flexible and managed to adjust the menus for our teenagers in one case they only charged 50 as our son made a mistake by choosing a soup great place,1
had dinner here before going to see wicked at apollo victoria theatre which was directly opposite the food was amazing full of flavour staff were very attentive and helpful it was very busy always a good sign would definitely eat here again ,1
me and my work mate love to pick up our lunches from lime orange every wednesday as they have special beef soup yukgaejang the beef soup is filling and really hearthy 4 50 takeaway for a portion and it is quite cheap and healthy as well my korean workmate loves their soup that tells alot about it i will definitely return they accept only cash for order below 7 and it can get quite packed during lunch time we used to order by phone and picked it up 10 mins later easier that way no queue ,1
lime orange has so many small tables fully occupied by residents and tourist the quantity of the food was enough so it was difficult to finish all also the tasty was great especially the quality of rice is very nice which is very important factor for their menu when you order bulgogi don t miss lettuce as side which is included always in korea ,1
the food was very nice it is value for money there were 10 of us and they did not mix up the order the food came in a timely manner the staff were also nice good korean meal,1
as the restaurant is within line of sight from the hamilton london theatre we went there to have a pre theatre meal food was so good we immediately came out of the matinee show and went back there for dinner the bimbibap is too good for words and the staff are very respectful and receptive to any patrons who suffer from food allergies definitely going back ,1
lovely atmosphere in this tiny restaurant the waiters could not be more courteous the food was delicious and great value for central london definitely worth a visit ,1
no complaints dropped in here while passing had to wait slightly for a table but were dealt with courteously food was first class waiter was very friendly and helpful ,1
this restaurant was near perfect for a casual bus inn luncheon standards such as kimchi bulgolgi and grilled meats at the table were served in good portions and were satisfying the restaurant was a bit noisy not not distracting the noise added a layer of confidentiality to the business discussion the restaurant has room for improvement the added chili was a limp bottled sauce there were no small dishes typical of more upscale places and the seafood in the bulgogi was small in size and a tad light in volume within the dish though the cuisine was geared for a british audience there were several koreans among the clientele prices were reasonable and service was good ,1
we stopped here for a bite to eat after the theatre it s close to victoria palace theatre so an easy walk wonderful food and service was exceptional they helped us choose several tasty entrees the bibimbap was great and noodles were yummy we will visit again,1
we loved our food at this restaurant tried kimchi for the first time and can see why it wows quick service in a deservedly busy restaurant we loved it ,1
this place is amazing you have to come and try the food it s quite a small space and if you haven t made a reservation then you are likely have to wait but its worth it it s the go to place for people that work locally good quality food at a decent price what more can you ask for,1
looking for a place to eat before the theatre we found lime orange on tripadvisor oh my we were seated as it opened at 5 as were several other tables the service was efficient but not rushed they are clearly used to the pre theatre crowd but oh my goodness the food it was delicious a korean food fan in our group ordered a variety of dishes for us and she was seriously impressed i just kept eating the food was fresh and plentiful and superb so concentrated were we on our dinner that we d not noticed the restaurant was packed and folk were waiting forget the theatre go for great food ,1
we were looking for a dinner before the hamilton show nearby we found a korean restaurant which is my favourite food we arrived at 530pm and there is not very busy the decoration is cozy but the table is a bit close to next table the food served very quick the waiter came to explain how we should enjoy the food he is very friendly and we spend some time to talk to him about korean culture as well the food taste so good that make me feel like i am in korean we finished our dinner within a hour and people was waiting for the seat therefore we left and heading to our show ,1
there are many fancy and expensive korean restaurants in london this is truly one of the best korean restaurants in london no wonder why the restaurant is regarded as 1 in tripadvisor highly recommended to try their tofu kimchee for the starter and hot stone bibimbap ,1
meeting a friend for lunch we thought we would try lime orange when we arrived it was really busy but there was a table for 4 available so we sat ourselves down and waited to be served after five minutes we were told that as there was only 2 of us we had to move and join the table behind us we did ask if we could stay on our table and other people join us but they wanted to keep the table for 4 free just in case a party of 4 walked in so we joined the other table although the current occupants were a little taken aback but there really was not much room for 4 and couldn t talk freely then table for 2 became available so we moved to the free table we were then told we couldn t have this table as it had been reserved so no one waiting a table for 4 and a table for 2 unused but we could only join a table already occupied by 2 people at the point we felt very unwelcome and decided to leave my view on the food can t be included but we definitively did not feel the love looking at other posts it seems we aren t the only ones dissatisfied with their seating technique if you want korean food then give it a try but if there are just 2 or less in your party then find somewhere a bit more welcoming ,0
absolutely love the food there had dinner for the second time and had not been disappointed the place is small so come early if you want a table ,1
great food visited on a wet busy saturday lunchtime when it was full but with a nice buzzy atmosphere we all had bibinbap and can thoroughly recommend them just watch your hands on the very hot dish service left a little to be desired but really good prices ,1
i met an old work colleague for a catchup over a meal at lime orange selected for its proximity to victoria and an interest in trying korean food i found the service to be brisk and efficient food great i had the seafood bibimbap lots of seafood delicious and my friend chose the pork belly with rice and lettice which he enjoyed too the restaurant has a row of tables galley style quite close together but we did not find this uncomfortable and were able to converse well beers were bottled korean and japanese offered and served cold we had an enjoyable couple of hours at this restaurant and although the menu may be somewhat limited compared to a previous visit i had to a korean restuarant the food smacks of korean flavours ,1
this korean restaurant had awesome reviews but their food wasn t anything special i mean it was tasty but it missed the final touch the service was quick and friendly even though they forgot one of our starters it was a bit overpriced compared to the quality of the food ,1
simply a great restaurant friendly and fast service well made and prepared food comfortable seating we only planned to go for lunch but enjoyed it so much we went back for dinner after that afternoon s performance ,1
we found this little jam by chance and what a nice surprise they do not take reservations during pick hours but the service is quick so we just waited 10 min our bibimbap were terrific and finally a decent size portion london is famous for downsizing all the foreign food remarkable kimchi i suppose homemade i would skip the cakes and the ice creams very average and bit overpriced our waitress was super nice ,1
amazing host and amazing fresh food must go back again quick service good quality and reasonable prices,1
great quick korean food right by victoria bibimba was delicious proper crispy rice bottom kimchi was good vegan and veggie options would defo go again ,1
we went to lime orange before seeing hamilton the distance between the theatre and restaurant is minimal if using google maps you are sent to the back of the building so maybe ask a nearby shop for directions if you are not sure the restaurant decor is basic but comfortable there is a takeaway menu available food was great affordable and came out promptly our server was friendly and efficient the bibimbap was amazing and reminded me of my travels in korea the kimchi is homemade and pairs well with the dishes the main dishes are a good portion size and will keep you full the barley tea is a really lovely way to finish the meal and tastes like coffee the only element of the meal i was disappointed in was the black sesame ice cream the concept is a good idea however the ice cream had ice crystals overall this is a good restaurant for those who love no frills yummy korean food ,1
delicious korean food very affordable under 10 for a main just a stones throw from victoria station ,1
popped in for a quick lunch before watching hamilton at the nearby theatre basically a korean one dish meal place their servings are large in fact one bowl could have been shared by the two of us since we aren t normally big lunch eaters service is no frills but efficient food is tasty and basic they only take cash so make sure you have enough,1
stumbled on this restaurant while on the way to see wicked awesome food great friendly service and great value for money we were luckily as we got a table straight away as soon as we sat down a queue stated to form with people willing to wait for a table that s how good it is ,1
my friend lived in ulsan for a year and was missing the food so we thought we d try out this place and it did not disappoint we had a fairly long wait for the table as it was busy not surprising being opposite a theatre but the staff were attentive and we had a nice chat with other customers waiting we ordered a bottle of soju between us jug of water japchae kimchee jeon cucumber kimchee and the spicy chicken bulgogi with rice and lettuce all dishes were super tasty and all worked well together along with all the dipping sauces on the table needless to say my friend lived the food and was impressed by how good it was compared to other places she s tried the only improvement would be to have other flavours of soju we ll definitely be back and most likely booking a table as well ,1
went to lime orange pre hamilton we both had bibimaps chicken and seafood and really enjoyed the food service was good the place was very friendly as it was pre theatre we only had the one course though it came with misu soup but others around us were enjoying other dishes so i would definitely reccomend it,1
first experience of korean food and it was delicious random choice from the extensive menu and we couldn t have made a better selection lovely polite staff and food appeared swiftly which was good as we were off to a show ,1
our first experience of korean food as with previous comments we weren t disappointed there was a reasonable range of options for us as vegetarians everything we chose was tasty enjoyable it s certainly a cuisine i d be keen to try again perhaps in a slightly less rushed less busy setting service was friendly efficient fast good value for money well located for victoria bus station,1
we booked this restaurant for 5 people four weeks ago we reconfirmed our reservation two days before as we were travelling 60 miles into london to meet friends for supper we arrived on time to be informed yes they had our reservation but they had no tables available we would have to wait standing for maybe twenty minutes and then he could squeeze five of us onto a table for four said he was sorry and they just overbooked tables this was said matter of factly it would appear to be their normal practice no free drink offered if we chose to wait we left and found a good restaurant nearby the front of house staff couldn t have cared less with such an indifferent cavalier attitude to customers you have to wonder what happens in their kitchen avoid at all costs ,0
we visited this restaurant before a show based on its good ratings and closeness to the apollo victoria we have eaten at a few korean restaurants over the years and this is by far the worst food was edible but average uninspiring and underwhelming felt as though minimum effort made for tourist trade service was friendly and helpful if not a little chaotic ,1
i should mention this is my first experience of korean food so i have nothing to compare it against we were keen for the kids to broaden their horizons and none of us were disappointed the food was very good and the service friendly and fast we also enjoyed the korean beer the decor is simple but attractive reasonably priced for central london great location right opposite apollo theatre they keep half the restaurant for walk in business we will certainly return ,1
ok so i m not the biggest fan of korean food but if you are this might be for you 2 mins walk from victoria station practically opposite and super fast service if you want to catch a train my tip is get there early before 7pm to be sure of a table ,1
first time in a korean restaurant excellent food very healthy service was quick highly recommended will definitively visit again when i m back in london ,1
i m staying in london for three months and have tried 4 5 korean korean japanese restaurants this is the only place we returned three times for dinner including tonight my wife and i are koreans we both agree this is by far the best korean food in terms of quality price and portion we found the place gets busy after 6pm so we started visiting right after 5pm just as soon as they re open for dinner two min walk from victoria station ,1
before the theatre we went here i have been here a couple of times first time when i went with my family and it was nice so i took a my friend and it was not nice as i experienced but i thought i will give another try it is near by the victoria station and we need something to eat before heading off to her majesty theatre we had kimchi pancake spicy chicken dolsot bibimbab chicken katu with udon noodle hot pot bulgogi the flavour was there but all of were over sweetened the korean foods are well balanced umami taste i think if they do work more of balancing the flavour then they will be buzzing with lot of people ,1
great korean food and wonderful service the menu is extensive so you are bound to find many things to choose from the wait staff was polite and attentive the restaurant was lively but not too noisy i had no problem find gluten free dishes four of us all enjoyed our experience at lime orange ,1
visited for an early evening dinner and found the food to be average overall my starter beef bulgogi was delicious and had a lot of flavour the kimchi pancakes were ok but tasted very little of kimchi the bibimbap was average fresh ingredients but very little taste it needed a lot more seasoning would i return no ,0
new discovery and finally able to try a proper bibimbap and it did not disappoint not a glamorous restaurant which is fine because the food is delicious and staff really helpful and organised can t wait to return ,1
my husband and i had eaten here in october on our first vacation in london we had pork belly and beef bulgogi the food was very tasty and the staff amazing the guy who served us the food helped us whith the barbecue and even explained to us how to use the chopstix kam sa ham ni da ,1
we were looking for somewhere for pre theatre lunch and called into lime orange excellent find great food excellent service reasonably priced i thoroughly recommend it and here s a tip for you order one bowl of bibimbap for two people and get some side dishes to go with it the bib has seven vegetables plus rice plus meat of tofu of your choice and is very filling ,1
we pre booked our table for a pre theatre supper with friends we had missed out the previous week when we popped in on the off chance although the restaurant was empty when we arrived at 5 30 it filled rapidly and was full by 6 30pm when we left we had not had korean before so it is difficult to say how authentic the cuisine was but it was served promptly hot and it was very very tasty we even had some tuition about how to combine the various parts of a meal into a traditional mouthful from a waitress well worth the visit,1
had the chicken katsu udon for mains and i completely reccommend the restaurant is very close to where wicked is shown and it was a very satisfactory dinner ,1
recommended to me by two colleagues one visiting from japan who goes regularly with korean friends great food we had a good mixture between us friendly quick service thoroughly recommend ,1
i m a big fan of korean food and this place has large portions extremely tasty food and all delivered super speedily with great customer service and surprisingly decent prices i went at opening time and was surprised to see how it was packed out so fast but now it is very understandable definitely would recommend ,1
great food great service korean beer sadly isn t too special but the food was what i was there for primarily ,1
food was great high quality as i expect of good korean only reason for 4 star rather than 5 is presentation korean tradition is to serve small complimentary dishes with meals and those were absent extra charge which is not korean tradition ,1
a small korean restaurant close to victoria station we had a time schedule to hold and asked for food that could be served quite quickly we ate bibimbap and were happy with both taste service and the time a place to recommend ,1
this restaurant doesn t seem to understand the seriousness of food allergies i have a very serious potentially life threatening nut allergy so when we arrived i specifically told the waiter that i had a nut allergy when we ordered our mains and asked him to go and check that the food didn t have nuts in after we d eaten our main meal which was delicious best bibimbap in london i asked a waitress for the dessert menu she said there was just green tea icecream for dessert so we ordered some when it came i tried some and i thought it had nuts in which the staff confirmed although they hadn t felt it necessary to mention when i ordered i thought this was really poor particularly as i d explicitly let them know about my allergy fortunately i only ate a tiny quantity of the ice cream so i didn t have a serious anaphylactic allergic reaction just stomach cramps and some difficulty breathing but someone with a more serious allergy than mine could easily have died from that so lime orange needs to do a lot better to support its customers with allergies i really wouldn t recommend eating here if you have serious food allergies ,0
thank goodness we booked place full to the gunnels ordered cucumber and pear kimchi belly pork bologi and beef stew and calamari kimchi was delish pork dish very bland needed something the beef stew was tender rich and really enjoyed it the calamari was battered with sweet chilli sauce batter so thick and chewy couldn t taste the main star i would go again and try some other items as love korean food ,1
turned up at 12 when the place is still empty ie just opening by half past it was full including a pleasing proportion of people who looked as though they might have some korean heritage deep fried prawns were superb and vast for only 8 50 and the bibimbap chicken for me beef for her was so good that we ate till our stomachs groaned normally i d only be in victoria to go somewhere else this place might just drag me back ,1
went here after we tried to check in early at the goring a bustling place a hot spot for locals and the food did not disappoint the calamari was awesome and the short rib soup as well very good prices for this area in london ,1
love to try out local ethnic cuisine good korean speaking of locals there were quite a few locals there if you go after 6 plan on a wait service not bad for a korean restaurant though i realize i m making generalizations slightly different concept you pay extra for the ban chan side dishes and even white rice minimal cost though very limited ban chan too but a nice change if you ve been eating a lot of british food ,0
i took my team for an early evening meal and arrived at 6pm for the restaurant to be full so was pleased that i had booked the staff helped everyone choose suitable dishes and the bbq in the table was a good bit of entertainment the overall bill was very reasonable for central london and by the time we were leaving there was a queue waiting to come in given 4 stars as the wc is tiny and needs a bit of tidying up ,1
visited today before seeing wicked at 2 30pm i read the reviews beforehand and kinda knew it was going to be busy we arrived around 1pm and it was packed but to be fair we only had to sit and wait for around 10 minutes we was not disappointed the guys were busy yet welcoming and friendly we went for the 18 50 set menu the vegetable dumplings to start with were little parcels or tastiness our main was chicken bulgogi served with rice and side of lettuce leafs the guy explained we had to use the lettuce leaf like a wrap and add the chicken etc this was a great experience the tastes were gorgeous we had a couple of extras fried chicken wings and katsu chicken both equally as tasty we would not hesitate to recommend and revisit lime orange thoroughly enjoyed it here ,1
used to be a fantastic place for korean food but except for the bibimbop has really gone down the japchae glass noodle salad as well as some of the other staples no longer stand out but still a good place for the various bibimbops ,1
this resto is small we had no reservation which is not a problem could seat immediately we had the bibimbap and bulgogi both were very nice the chopsticks are not the typical korean s but more chinese so easier for non experts to handle staff is friendly food comes swift come in early because there is a queue building up waiting patiently for food ,1
we stopped here for a dinner and had a plain bapbimbot and a hot bapbimbot both were very good i added and order of kimchi which was just tight actually put most in my dinner service was good and prices were right ,1
very good korean food at a fair price often busy in the evenings a good atmosphere and smiling service recommend the bibimbap and bulgogi both delicious and fresh ,1
checked the opening hours before going and on the website it said 10 30pm arrived at 9 55 on a tuesday and they only offered to serve me for take away i had been wanting to come to this place for a while but surely won t be coming back due to the appalling service if the closing hour is really 10 00pm they need to update their website either that or the waiters were in a rush and wanted to go home early ,0
we didn t had a reservation but this was no problem fast waiters good staters but the bibimbap was really really good the price unbeaten for this part of london unfortunatly we didn t had enough space left for a desert but i m sure they would be good aswell ,1
we were a couple that stopped by after reading some good reviews on tripadvisor and were given a table in the otherwise full restaurant straight away around 19 00 on a weekday we both had the bibimbap after asking for recommendations from the waiter which he carefully explained along with some other items on the menu that we had never heard of once the food arrived we were instructed what it was and how you are supposed to eat it overall the food was both tasty and inexpensive and the service was very good we ll definitely make a visit during our next stay in london ,1
small family run restsurant with great korean food friendly service fair price a taste of korea locatrd near victoria station definitely would go back ,1
saw lime orange on ti with great reviews once again i must agree with my fellow ti reviewers having lived in korea of and on for 12 years this is a good korean restaurant they would do well in korea they do not serve all the side dishes like you would find in the kunsan region but that aside it is good korean food we had the bi bin with beef and one with seafood the place is smallish by england standards maybe seating 50 to 60 people we walked in and there were two tables open for two people each from 1900 to 2000 thursday we saw they had to turn away a dozen people very popular ,1
had dinner with some friends on a saturday evening didn t have to wait for a table at 19 00 we ordered a few dishes and the food was perfectly fine i just didn t feel any of the food was really great given the other reviews i ordered the kimchi jjigae but found it to be a little too watery more like a soup than a stew staff were attentive and overall it was a fair experience i would also say the place is quite small and the seating on the wall was a little uncomfortable two starters a side dish and three mains with drinks for three people came to around 60,0
it s within walking distance from victoria coach station so we tried it see menu the staff was very friendly and food tasted great recommend pork bulgogi downside you have to buy rice separately water is free but no refills service was quick menu made it clear prices include tax and tip overall good dining experience ,1
my wife and i had tickets to see wicked as part of our first wedding anniversary and wanted somewhere local to the theatre to enjoy a pre show dinner i took a chance on google to suggest venues and lime orange came up as one of the top recommendations so off we went it was exactly the right choice the service was quick and very efficient despite it being very busy almost full the food was absolutely superb i chose the spicy chilli prawns for a starter my wife the tofu salad the prawns were huge and incredibly well done the sauce perfect my wife s salad was exactly the same simple but excellent for mains i had the katsu chicken curry my wife the tofu bibimbap again both were simply perfect however beyond the food there was one thing that makes us give this restaurant the 5 it deserves we arrived with enough time to eat before curtain up however each set of diners who arrived after us were asked if they were going to the theatre as time closed on curtain up each new customer was advised of how long each sitting might take and that they may not make curtain up this restaurant was willing to lose covers to allow them to get to the show on time that s a very unselfish and utterly professional decision that favours the customer my wife and i will go back for the food alone and will definitely recommend it to anyone wanting sensibly priced beautifully cooked food excellent service and an eye for customer service second to none go visit ,1
me and my friend came for dinner on a weekday we arrived at 7pm and all the tables were full luckily we had a 15 minute wait the food was delicious and the staff were very attentive i would definitely recommend anyone to go here for a meal the price of the food is relatively cheap as well i m definitely going to make a return visit ,1
wow such a great meal there was a bit of a line for a thursday i waited for about 20 minutes but the food totally made up for it i had the chicken katsu udon which is a delicious fried chicken with a sweet sauce and some very tasty noodles with vegetables and the soy chicken which was great as well all waiters are very nice although very busy as the place is packed i highly recommend this place just be patient if there s a line try to come around 8 30 or 9 as the place is less busy and enjoy the food ,1
we visited for dinner and felt welcome and staff were so friendly we were served food very quickly within 10 minutes or so after ordering dishes we ordered bibimbap beef bbq rice kimchee but beef was thick and dried seems not marinated enough and so it was different from what i expected when we got a bill we found that they added service fee and i was surprised as casual restaurant like this normally do not add it was disappointing that food quality staff service restaurant concept seem not matching even though staff service was wonderful ,1
don t expect swanky tables and crystal glasses but do expect excellent korean food with a realty good menu choice we only stopped for a quick lunch the place was really busy but the service was good and the food arrived quickly i would love to visit again for dinner so i can try some other dishes would definitely recommend and it is good value for money ,1
a few veggie and vegan options but great value and a really cool atmosphere quite a small place but still really good,1
i ve never felt so unwelcome at any restaurant in my life in 5 minutes it became apparent the money grabbing philosophy in which they work so i didn t even get to sit down first of when i arrived a party of 4 arrived behind me the waiter didn t even look at me and got them a table first i attempted to speak out but neither waiter or customers were bothered but the worse part came next when i finally got some attention i asked for a table for 1 the waiter said at the moment they only had the counter which is just next to the door as this was the windiest and rainiest day of the last month i said i d prefer not to i wanted a small table this was flat out refused when i asked why i couldn t get a table the waiter said if a party of 2 comes then they always have priority mind you no one was waiting behind me at this point and i still got told i could only get my table an hour later when for them it was unlikely to be able to fill it up with 2 people such short sighted vision to customer service can only be from team orders and not a one time experience this made me leave straight away with the promise of never returning i m in restaurants all the time because of work and this is the first time anything remotely similar happened to me bad service might not translate directly to bad food in the short run but it will eventually catch up and they will lose their customers unacceptable ,0
we went here for lunch while in london we are fans of asian cuisine it was close to our hotel appeared well recommended we had terrific lunch calamari for appetizer seafood stew for main course with sticky rice total cost 30 quick service nice folks there,1
there are delicious dishes with good prices my daughter i had the bibimbob beef stew that were good its next to the victoria station behind the wicked theater ,1
we all got excited about some good korean barbecue and the menu looks great but our experience wasn t that great first the place is very crowded which by itself is not bad may indicate good food but after waiting a while the get seated we found out that the korean bear was not cold and there were couple of other options that we didn t look or the appetizers were really small and the kimchi was not very pickled but rather mushy and not to much flavor also the barbecue was not crisp and not very well marinated and to top everything we almost got embarrassed at the end when we were told that their card reader wasn t working and that we should go across the street to get some cash ,0
we almost walked straight past lime orange and honestly from the outside it doesn t do much to entice you in however we had heard good things about the place and decided to give it a go and we are so glad we did it is a small restaurant but cosy if a little bit on the warm side the menu offers a good amount of choice but is not at all daunting we started off sharing some soy chicken which were good but a fairly big portion for just one person and the japchae delicious and vegetable mandu brilliant the pork bulgogi was incredibly good possibly the best i have had it was all presented well you mix up the meat and rice with the sauce and stuff it into the lettuce leaves which makes for a filling tasty meal the service was slightly on the slow side but the food was all so good and the waiter was helpful so we didn t really mind a bit of a wait this will definitely become one of our regular haunts and we look forward to coming back again ,1
this restaurant is small in terms of the space internally but the food was very nicely seasoned and the price was friendly in the pocket we love the kim chi chigee the preserved cabbage soup as it came with rice the chapchae was ok and the bugolgi both beef and the chicken i personally enjoyed the beef better the only thing is that it looks like there were only one or two waitress waiter there to serve so when it is busy over lunchtime you do have to have a little patient ,1
love lime orange there are good choice of korean food which taste very very good and reminds me my trip to soul plus food dishes are at reasonable prices and portions are in good size recommend to try bibimbap book a table for a dinner while i didn t get a place without booking or need to wait ,1
delicious had beef bibimbap and kimchi soup it was flavorful the place is really closed to victoria train station ,1
lime orange always come here with my colleagues after our long day at work excellent service from staff food is very tasty yummy price is cheaper than other korean restaurant in london their bbq bibimbap plum tea is a must try,1
i discovered this place last year as part of my family s increasing love for korean cooking i have been here some five times over the last several months each time i ready myself for a disappointment saying to myself that it can t always be this good but it is this time my wife and i each had a bulgagi pork and spicy chicken both were exceptional spicy flavourful and a joy in every mouthful will definitely return soon ,1
had a pre theatre dinner here with my wife mother and the food was outstanding first taste of korean food and i ve left wanting more i ll definitely be a return customer to start we had spicy calamari spicy prawns and vegetable dumplings mains were chicken bibimbap chicken katsu udon and beef bulgogi with green tea black sesame ice cream to finish all dishes packed full of flavour and customers with large smiles upon their faces a great meal for a respectable price a must if you re visiting victoria or the theatre ,1
i arranged to meet some friends while i was visiting london they had to come in on the train so i was simply was trawling tripadvisor searching for a nice restaurant near victoria where we could meet up and lime orange popped up the reviews were great and everyone was happy to give it a go and how glad we were that we did the food is delicious and plentiful the staff are friendly and can give you really good advice about the menu i can t recommend the bibimbap enough and the bill was also a pleasant surprise because we d ordered a lot go there you won t be disappointed ,1
really good food at reasonable prices efficient and friendly service and decent sized portions would definitely go there again,1
stumbled upon this place near victoria station friendly staff delicious food cute restaurant bibimbap was perfectly crispy vegetarian friendly,1
i do not have a bad word to say about this it reminds me of being in asia and the experience and food is quite like it i don t have a bad word to say about this place and i would eat here everyday it would be good if they did a few cheap options i suppose but i still go here often ,1
they serve really good food for reasonable prices but this place is really small the staff are really nice though even if they are busy they will not hesitate to offer you their service ,1
the food was very good and environment cosy and casual full of koreans and japanese so that that says it all cost 30 per head with 2 starter 2 main dishes and bottle of wine,1
good korean food with reasonable pricing can be quite crowded during eating times so be there slightly early fast serving be sure to try it before watch wicked opposite at victoria,1
what can i say great delicious food great service comfortable relaxed atmosphere reasonably priced only downside i can see is that this restaurant only takes cash,1
lovely food small resto but very efficient and the food is gorgeous simple but amazing taste vegan option although most are meat based ,1
the food was delicious and quick service was very good it was crowded so a bit warm in the restaurant so we were in and out quick but everyone enjoyed their meal very tasty ,1
went to this based on tripadvisor reviews and it did not disappoint had the chicken bulgogi and chicken bimibap service was friendly and helpful with recommendations convenient to victoria station tube station ,1
we arrived few minutes after 22 they didn t allowed us in because kitchen closed at 22 we begged to enter because e were arriving from a six hour flight delay and we said anything to eat even cold dishes would be fine no way too late to be kind ,0
great to find this place amidst all of the identikit chains in this area its easy to miss and almost looks as if its closed from outside once you get in however its coolly decorated with really good reasonably priced food and friendly service excellent bibimbap definitely recommended ,1
great little korean restaurant offering absolutely authentic dishes at very affordable rates good service ,1
even from outside the place look very small not so much attracting the food is really tasty the best korean food i ever had bibimbap bulgogi kimchi were delicious staff very friendly i definitely suggest it if you want to taste real korean food ,1
i stopped in here with a friend for a post work catch up by total chance and it was the best surprise ever food was incredibly fresh and delicious and staff super friendly all reasonably priced too for so central will definitely be back ,1
from the outside it is unassuming and looks rather small inside i had one of the best korean foods i have had in a long time and it didn t cost an arm and a leg alot of people here are making complaints or whining about the price portion giving them unfair comparisons to some place they tried on the other side of the world for london it stands out as great value for money and generous portions with quality to match my particular favourite was dukbokgi and we had a bbq ed our meat at the table and the service helped out with this as well by making sure the meat was cooked properly i do recommend you book in advance it s small and cosy but also popular ,1
beautifully prepared food that is excellent value waiting staff are also extremely friendly keep up the good work ,1
met a friend here for lunch it was packed by 12 30 but we were lucky and got a spot food is reasonably priced we both adore korean food but both agreed it was average much better bbq in hawaii would return though and try more dishes ,1
food was good nice taste portion was a little small i wanted more to eat took a while before we got our bill its pretty much opposite wicked price was ok i had bibimbap which was was yummy small restaurant,1
met up with old friends and decided to visit here based on tripadvisor reviews it was very busy and we were sat right next to the front door despite having booked a table in advance personally it was bad positioning as it was bitterly cold and every time someone came and went the cold air rushed in and it was not pleasant service was good food was good but i just feel it is a very tiny restaurant and there are too many tables crammed in and it makes getting comfortable and enjoying your meal not a great experience i don t like the next table practically sitting in my lap when eating but of course this is a personal thing and other folk may not mind this for me it was a little bit like sardines in a tin but as i say food good as was service don t think i would go back for a 2nd visit unless restaurant was quieter ,0
went for a pre theatre bite to eat would recommend great service good food and pleasant environment had the korean bbq two adults and 2 kids 10 13 all enjoyed,1
a friend and i were looking for somewhere to eat near victoria and after reading all the reviews about how good the food was here decided to give it a go to be honest i found the flavours quite bland and despite ordering the spiciest meal on the menu then adding chilli sauce still didn t find it spicy the staff were quite slow there was a considerable break between finishing our meal and having the table cleared no one ever asked if we wanted another drink or dessert just didn t seem very attentive the food was ok and reasonably priced just didn t live up to the expectations i had after the reviews on here saying that the cucumber kimchee was nice so if you do give it a try i would recommend that ,1
a last minute find and what a find after reading the tripadvisor reviews saying it was very busy as soon as it opens i thought it must be good me and my sister arrived about 5 45 and it was already busy but we got a table straightaway this was my first korean meal and the food was amazing and very filling for starter we had bolgogi salad lovely tender strips of beef japchae a wonderful plate of glass noodles pa jeon mini egg pancakes filled with spring onions with vinegar dip for main beef bibimbap basically a big hot pot of rice meat and veg very very yummy and chicken bolgogi which came with rice and lettuce and a bowl of miso 50 with tea the food was wonderful and the service friendly fast and attentive definitely try this place,1
great food excellent and friendly service cannot find anything wrong with this place would highly recommend it ,1
i ve lived in korea and have a korean husband and am totally in love with this restaurant the food is authentic delicious and generously portioned the bibimbap tofu kimchi and yangnyeom chicken are must tries having eaten a lot of korean food not only do i love the authenticity of the menu but i also find it a great way to introduce korean food to people who haven t tried it before the menu is simple but concise with delicious options to cater for the less adventurous with regards to spice and ingredients whilst they build up their confidence i have converted many friends and family members to korean food at lime orange in addition to the food the service at this family run restaurant is second to none friendly warm and welcoming making it a great place to hang out ,1
ordered an uber take away chicken bibimbap and kimchi delicious but no forks o o just imagine you re hungry you just got a warm meal but you cannot touch it bit disappointing ,0
a fabulous meal in very friendly restaurant the choice on all courses was vast and cooked to perfection,1
we searched for a korean restaurant in london and this one appeared planned to go out for the 14th not specifically for valentine s but booked just in case and it was constantly busy it s opposite the apollo and easy to find from victoria sunny was very attentive and looked after everyone we chose set meal which was too much might have been better to order off menu as we had too much but enjoyed sunny was very accommodating and didn t stick to set menu and when we mentioned food was over salted he didn t quibble but came to say sorry and admitted it may have been too much and reduced bill which was very nice of him really enjoyed our experience and great start to an evening in london and we re ready for a night of laughs at a comedy club ,1
despite being way busier than last time i visited it didn t disappoint beautiful food all round even though dining alone i had to wait veg mandu kimchee and beef bibimbap all gorgeous highly recommended except please don t go when i want to get in ,1
really delicious korean food especially the pajeon it s a must order dish definitely 1 of the nicest pajeon that i ve tasted many diners around us were having jjamppong so i ordered it as well really nice and spicy soup base it warms the stomach and body during cold weather but i would prefer to have thinner noodles compared to the udon noodle they used nevertheless it s still a great bowl of noodle the sweet rice drink tasted great as well i ll definitely return for more if i travel to london again ,1
small busy and live korean restaurant i ve been 3 times and the food is always good the prices are very reasonable too give the place a try and you won t be disappointed,1
i have to say korean food has become one of my favourite cuisines the depth of flavour is to die for if you haven t tried korean food before you definitely should like very soon ,1
we went for lunch here before a trip to the theatre it is quite a small place but we were able to be seated right away the menu has the usual korean favourites and the sizzling bibimbap dishes in particular looked very good we had the bulgolgi beef and yukgae jang with dukbokgi as a starter which wasn t too spicy and it was all high quality our waiter was friendly and would helpfully explain to customers the usual way of eating particular dishes ,1
when we discovered this local family run korean place 2 years ago it immediately became a big hit with our office multiple trips per week to begin with and then settling at a consistent weekly or fortnightly visit ever since i would bring friends family here when visiting the city for the weekend and advocate people go out of their way even to seek it out their yangyeum chicken starter was to die for their bibimbaps tasy and their pork bulgogi especially good unfortunately my regular lunch pal and i have noticed a steady decline in portion size and food quality over the last 6 months or so alongside a slow rise in prices we have often remarked before while dining here how pleased we are that this brilliant little friendly restaurant had not succumbed to the trend only too often seen at local establishments that gain popularity that temptation to try to further increase profit margins by switching to cheaper cuts of meat changing suppliers and suffering a noticeable dip in quality and getting stingy with portions unfortunately this has now happened first our beloved yangyeum chicken previously so good that we had visited and ordered only two portions of this delicious starter each as our meals was switched from a generous pile of easy to eat boneless chicken thigh i d guess to chicken wings instead without any change to the menu i should add next the generous portion was downsized to just 5 wings tested on multiple occasions for consistency and finally the price was actually increased now many people very much enjoy chicken wings so what s wrong with that you might ask well for the tourists who might wander in once on their visit to see buckingham palace absolutely nothing but for those living or working locally we know better we know what came before and i ll tell you this for nothing bitesize pieces of dark meat are far easier to eat cleanly with chopsticks while on an office lunch break or having a business meeting than fiddly little battered wings smothered in a very sticky spicy sweet sauce we ve also observed a decrease in the bibimbap sizes smaller portions of accompaniments increased greasiness and lower quality of meats e g the belly pork and further subtle price increases across the menu i think we feel particularly strongly just because of how much love we had for this place initially and what a stark contrast there is the first time we went after they d made the thigh to wing switch the waiting staff actually apologized to us for the change when we ordered knowing full well we d be disappointed now they simply look at us apologetically when we arrive in the doorway sadly while we ve really been trying to keep coming our regular visits may now have come to an end the decline has crossed a threshold like many of the best things in life it seems it couldn t last forever tl dr if you re in town for the weekend fancy some korean and are in the area you could do far worse than lime orange if however you ve been before and loved it say a year ago or so don t come back you ll be sorely disappointed d,0
visited with friends and was blown away from the quality of the food and the explosion of flavours i wasn t expecting much when my friend took me there but was so glad he did the bibimbap i had included 7 vegetables and beef vegan options available my friend had the spicy pork ribs which were great too prices are on the cheap side considering its in victoria which is a huge plus would definitely recommend ,1
this is a lovely place for the most wonderful service the food is good clean and flavoursome which is remarkablein this day and age the food is really preety and tasty the staffsare very friendly ,1
we ate at lime orange to celebrate the end of a project we all thoroughly enjoyed the food i had dukbokgi followed by pork bibimbap my colleagues had calamari and beef bulgogi salad followed by beef bulgogi and pork bibimbap service was friendly and rapid and there was a real energy in the restaurant if we hadn t booked we wouldn t have got a table food was fresh and well spiced and portions were very generous it s a little while since i ve been here but i ll definitely be back ,1
first time here and i will definitely go back if i am in the area the food was really nice really tasty and not expensive at all considering it is london good quality and quick service it is a very small place that you may miss walking around but it is definitely worth it plenty of dishes for vegetarians too ,1
i went there with my friends and we had bug in our food the manager refused to compensate us only provided free food but we couldn t eat it anymore totally unacceptable ,1
had a really nice meal but the stand out was the service really attentive and friendly my meal didn t taste that different to a chinese except for the lettuce but it was good,1
i have limited experience with korean food so i was looking for somewhere i could experiment without breaking the bank lime orange was a great place to have a weekday lunch and try a couple of dishes it s a small popular restaurant with friendly staff who wil give you a steer if you need it a great place to eat if you live or work nearby but not a destination restaurant ,1
tried this restaurant as keen to sample korean food and was not disappointed yes the venue is small but the service was attentive and friendly and the food was delicious really enjoyed the food we ordered and the service was attentive and friendly would recommend booking a table ,1
a small un assuming café alongside victoria station but at 1215 completely full and buzzing we tried their two course set meal includes a glass of wine during cup of green tea and enjoyed the experience it was served very quickly really tasty and hot and slightly spicy just what we needed on a cold morning worth a visit ,1
just a minute walk from victoria station it was very convenience we did have lunch at there reached there at 1 15 pm but you should have to wait as i thought that it was very tiny food quality was good but price was bit more as well ,1
i just ordered through deliveroo a kimchee bibimbap extra crispy seaweed and a beer i was having a night in live very close to the restaurant and it arrived cold the rice was so luke warm it was pretty much cold for a restaurant that boasts of large portions the quantity of food was very small for the amount i paid the food was not remotely satisfying enough nor delicious and for the portion it was expensive the beer was not even cold enough sorry lime orange this is not good enough even delivery to a close destination must be to a high standard,0
little tiny restaurant with max 15 tables was waited around 40 mins however the food was quite nice all the ingredients are from korean supermarket love the beer here nice place to hang out with friend ,1
a little korean restaurant 3 mins walk from victoria station opposite wicked the theatre show tucked away next to russell hotel looks nothing special but the food was sooooo good soft drink starter main was 15 including tip they do a set menu for 18 50 including a glass of wine my friend had the katsu curry with udon noodles i had the tofu soup would go back tomorrow haven t ever had korean before but it was busy bustling you can book but only over the phone not on the day we walked in we had to pay cash as the machine wasn t working but all good a little secret gem of you are near victoria station,1
i d never had korean food before so i tried the katsu curry which i ve had at japanese restaurants really enjoyed so i had a basis for comparison it was very different but equally tasty coming with noodles instead of rice and a much tarter and thinner sauce the green tea ice cream was also very nice service a little slow although if you intend to make a whole evening of it then that s not really a problem small restaurant i d advise booking as it s clearly popular at the weekends i d go again ,0
we tried the bibimbap one beef and one pork and we enjoyed it very much i liked the aloe vera drink the ice cream was excellent as well good price quality ratio ,1
this was my first ever korean food experience so i cant really compare but i think the food was pretty good i especially liked the calamari in the sweet chilli sauce but all other dishes were nice too nice and cosy atmosphere and quick service if you have a chance to call in advance i would recommend to make a reservation as the place is really tinny and busy ,1
came across this little wonder while waiting for wicked didn t really expect much but wow awesome great food and atmosphere one family of 4 with full bellies resonabley priced for london great going guys,1
lovely cosy and lively atmosphere on a chilly winters saturday delicious food good portion sizes and affordable prices ticks all round had to wait quite a while for the food but understandable as they we busy and it was piping hot and well wroth the wait when it arrived i ll be back ,1
for the first time trying korean this restaurant gives you a good flavour the menu isn t vast but it s great for a quick flavoursome lunch or dinner i d recommend the traditional dish as the main simple and good food ,1
tiny restaurant with an extensive menu food was delicious though i would recommending reserving and the restaurant doesn t take cards cash only ,1
as a korean eating virgin this was a new one on me and chosen primarily as a lunch venue because of its proximity to victoria station the reason for lunch was a quarterly meeting with an ex client who has become a friend and we enjoyed the experience the service was excellent after we explained our inexperience but found it difficult to eat our pork belly in lettuce parcels with rice so reverted to normal eating practices the restaurant was busy and the clientele interesting although the tables were very close together making it feel like a cafe more than a restaurant that meant i marked it down from a four start to a three star experience this is an excellent place to eat decent food when travelling to and from victoria station especially because of the other execrable restaurants in the area but probably not worth travelling too far for ,1
great korean food super nice service i will definitely return to lime orange on my next trip to london,1
having never eaten korean food before we were novices but we were blown away by the food here the beef bibimbap and pork barbecue were both exceptional with loads of great flavour and freshness this is a small simple restaurant but is very friendly and serves a lovely pale korean lager we will look forward to returning ,1
we arrived at 7 30pm for a meal and were told that there would be a short wait as we had not made a booking we were seated after 10minutes and ordered pork and beef mains with the extra lettuce and rice the food was very good and a really good price for london would recommend to friends ,1
had a quick dinner there before watching a play and must say that their service is fast food was good and pricing was very reasonable by london standards ,1
called to make a booking but they dont take them on the day decided to arrive for dinner just before 6pm and snagged the last table service was great and friendly and the prawn and calamari starters where excellent ordered beef and pork mains with all the trimmings lettuce rice and spicy sauces so much amazing food couldnt help but finish it all even if we were about to pop ,1
we have ordered take away on saturday night with my favourite korean dishes i love udon noodles with catsu chicken and yam yam chicken yam yam chicken are chicken pieces cooked or fried in sweet chilli sauce and what i got was not yam yam chicken it was just chieckn wings in some sweet sticky sauce the same with udon noodles they were really oily and just avarage i got to kim chee they do the best korean food i was hoping that maybe i find resturant closer to me but unfortunately was left disappointed i will not order or go to this restaurant again ,0
we booked for lunch on a saturday because of the good trip advisor reviews and because it was near where we were going to be at lunch time not being familiar with korean food we opted for a set meal the staff were welcoming and thoughtful offering a fork instead of chop sticks judging by the dominance of non english conversations and eastern eyes we thought this must definitely be authentic food ,1
great little find opposite the apollo theatre victoria serving good korean food popular dishes such as kimchee and bibimbap are on the menu you also have the option of grilling your your own meat a meal for three of us including drinks cost us 80 great value for money highly recommended ,1
was in the area for work and didn t fancy boring sandwiches or sushi that most of the places around offer with the help of the internet found this place and made my 15 minute way there which totally worth it when i came the place was quite empty i was welcomed by very friendly waiter and sat next to the window in a few minutes all spaces were taken and the place was buzzing but the only waiter was speedy nice and paying everyone equal attention i am a huge fan of korean food growing up in the country with lots of korean expats so i browsed through the menu and appreciated the selection i haven t had bibimbap in ages so opted for it with extra kimchi when it has arrived all bright and colourful on the sizzling hot plate along with some miso on the side and hot sauce i thought it was too beautiful to eat at the end the dish ended up being glorious with all ingredients fresh and flavourful definitely recommend the also have a lunch special that is different every day which i think is a great value will repeat my visit next time i am around the area ,1
the korean bbq is very good and the bibimbap is also very good the restuarant owner is very kind all the staff there are korean so you will have a feeling that this is what real korean restuarant should be ,1
5 of us ate here on a saturday night it was very busy but they managed to honour our reservation and squeeze us in most of us were new to korean food and they gave us suggestions which we really enjoyed very good value and friendly service i work hear here sometimes so will be recommending to colleagues we come back here some time ,1
stumbled upon this place by accident it s directly behind the apollo victoria theatre we had no idea as never tried korean food before but we were looked after by thao who guided us through the menu and made recommendations food and service fantastic i would recommend the calamari with sweet chilli sauce we shared a starter main and seaweed with a round of drinks and two soups it came to 29,1
a small restaurant across from a theatre near victoria station beeng a tourist we were out and avout and decided to eat just after it opened at 5 we got the second to last table and people were constantly comming in well i know why the food was fantastic at a reasonable price piping hot and not slow the waiter and waitress were run off their feet and pleasant at all times great food great service great price,1
fab place great food and definitely worth a visit be sure to book a table every single chair was occupied when i was there ,1
this little restaurant doesn t look like anything special from the outside but inside it s full and serving delicious korean food a perfect place for a quick meal but also a perfect place for a meal with friends over a bbq table we had such a fantastic meal here last night the bbq pork is unbelievably good eat with lettuce and sauce the last place i can compare this to was a great korean in new york this place is authentic and very busy as it s so popular go you won t be let down ,1
i always get sudden cravings for asian food when overseas and luckily lime orange was not far from where i was staying i had found this little gem through google suggestions by checking what asian restaurants were nearby and decided to give this place a try based on the impressive 4 star reviews the first time i visited lime orange i got dinner take out the restaurant was packed on a weekday night and once i walked in the food smelled authentic and right i got the beef bibimbap mixed rice bowl and it was delicious i had gone back several times afterwards and also tried dining at the restaurant other dishes i enjoyed were the japchae glass noodle stir fry dukbokgi rice cake in spicy sauce pa jeon seafood pancake and tofu soup just a gentle reminder that for those dining in try and avoid wearing knits because the restaurant does have bbq and grill options and the smell can stick to your clothes service is friendly and prices are reasonable they do take rsvps except between 6 15pm and 7 30pm it is located just walking distance from victoria station and opposite the apollo victoria theatre ,1
i really like this place and come here quite often for my lunch friday lunch special spicy chicken is really good and it only costs 3 99 cheaper than pret sandwich monday special is good too and bimbimbaps are nice too ,1
doesn t look much from the outside but the food is a wonderful example of japanese cuisine the people are friendly and helpful the service is quick but unhurried and the food id delicious and reasonably well priced however be warned it is advisable to book a a table i did because even though i was there at 5 30pm by six it was full and when i left at 6 45 they were queuing outside its right opposite victoria station so convenient for the train and the local theatre where wicked is currently playing i strongly recommend this restaurant and i feel sure you won t be disappointed,1
lovely little gem in london which cannot be recommended highly enough the bibimbap which we d never had before was absolutely incredible served extremely hot temperature not spice and such a nice change it was reasonably priced the servers were lovely and they managed to squeeze us in without booking at a busy time although i would recommend booking as it is a relatively small place ,1
 75 for two people was a bit pricey for a light lunch food good but not stunning pancakes a bit soggy and oily sake was the cheapest and a bit like fire water but i still drank it pick carefully and you will have a great meal ,0
having never had korean food we ordered from the set menu which was very reasonably priced and included a glass of wine and korean tea the food was delicious and not too spicy the dumplings in particular were lovely the waiter was extremely helpful in advising us what to order the best way to eat the food and he worked really hard in a busy restaurant a large number of the customers were korean which i think speaks for itself definitely worth a visit ,1
after reading trip adviser reviews thought to try this at lunch and would recommend delicious food and friendly and quick service and authentic given the number of locals who ate there too ,1
you know this is a good korean restaurant when a lot of the customers are koreans great for couples or family although a small restaurant the selection of food is not massive to me this is a good sign that they do well with what they offer and let me tell you the food is absolutely fantastic highly recommended ,1
having never tried korean food i was a bit worried it might be too spicy but the food was delicious had the mild chicken to start and beef for main there was plenty food the service maybe a bit too quick as we hadn t quite finished our starters when mains arrived overall good value for money and would go again if in the area ,1
this little restaurant serves absolutely delicious food give this place a go if you have never tried korean food before i had vegetable dumplings beef bulgogi a korean beer and my partner had spicy prawns spicy chicken bulgogi and japenese beer absolutely everything we had came out piping hot and very flavoursome we went for pre theatre dinner and were not disappointed thank you lime orange ,1
for a midweek meal out with two friends it was perfect all three of us asked the question of when we had last eaten anything so delicious no satisfactory answers were provided the price was very reasonable for the quality of the food the atmosphere was relaxed and the food came out very in an extremely timely manner the staff were faultless top notch very happy ,1
we ordered set menu one one chicken bulgogi and one pork which proved to be very flavoursome would definitely recommend for a nice meal out,1
i work in victoria and its quite hard to find a good place to eat i was impressed with the speedy service price portion size but most importantly the taste and flavour of the food was spot on they have a great daily lunch menu where you can eat in for 4 99 or take away for 3 99 it s a small restaurant so do book ahead if you are going in large numbers only downfall was that i wanted my bibimbap fix but they ran out of rice i ended up ordering yukgaejang soup and they offered noodles as an alternative and it was lovely never tried that before and now its something i would have again happy that i tried this restaurant and will be going back again ,1
excellent food waiter very knowledgable and advised on what to have service fast and food piping hot lovely to experience his type of cuisine over the road from the theatre to see wicked really worth a try ,1
i ordered salmon teriyaki 13 50 and all that i had was 1 piece of realy thin salmon ridicously greasy with at leats 150g of beansprouts my friend has noodles with no sauce and with 3 pieces of greasy chicken for 11 50 absolutely horrible do not order take away,0
close to apollo victoria made good sense for pre theatre dinner the staff were friendly and efficient helped with the order as we never eat korean before the food was good not too spicy very tasty and flavoursome place was busy tables were close but didn t seem as crowded at some of the other posts suggest certainly recommended,1
the portions were hearty for the price we paid the waiter was lovely and was always smiling we ordered starter and mains and it was the typical korean dishes would come here again ,1
good service good food simple menu i ordered what is best described as a sizzling bowl of rice pork and vegetables squeeze in a load of chilli sauce and mix it all together tasted great my only criticism is that whilst the atmosphere was vibrant it s one of those places when you re sat almost touching the person on the next table very noisy busy and hot ,0
if you fancy something a bit different for lunch this place is great would advise to book as it was very busy great service great food settings very basic but don t let it put you off ,1
my only negative comment restaurant was a bit tired looking but service was incredibly friendly and prompt atmosphere was good and the food was amazing brought to the table very quickly on sizzling hot plates for a very reasonable price will definitely return if we re in this part of london again ,1
it was my very first time in a korean restaurant with real korean food served since i love korea and know some of their dishes i tried the kimchee spicy calamari and a bibimbap dishes everything was very good i was soooo full at the end there was even space for some soju which was great very nice place near victoria station to enjoy this type of food kind and nice waiter and waitress that made it more enjoyable i will surely return ,1
my first korean meal and i very much enjoyed it our party had a selection of reasonably priced tofu beef and chicken dishes piping hot though unusually the side portion of spinach is served at fridge temperature some unusual drink options for the adventurous the place was full on weekday lunchtime good idea to book friendly service ,1
i was grabbing a quick meal before catching a train so ordered two starters i was disappointed in the bolgogi beef salad as the beef was served cold and the salad itself was overdressed the glass noodle salad with the same bolgogi beef but served hot was so much more pleasant other koreans do serve their salads with heated beef and it helps the flavour really come out nicely not particularly a warm experience no real welcome or send off but i would pop back in if i was craving asian near wicked or the victoria station and in a hurry ,0
an interesting place even if i am not particularly keen of plain simple corean food yet the starters are very good specially the dumplings and fish pancake ,0
i was so hungry at the time when i went but luckily the salmon i ordered was big and delicious the waiter was friendly and the food was served fast would definitely return but bad news is that the queue is always quite long ,1
good food good price but we had the impression they want us to leave soon as there was a queue otherwise i enjoyed ,1
so pleased with my dinner waiter was so nice about explain the dishes for me and solved my garlic issue i choose a chicken noddle without garlic that turn out amazing ,1
small place seated about 30 i guess just next to victoria station it s a small korean food place narrow room with tables down one side so atmosphere is limited but don t let that put you off as the food really is top notch and very reasonably priced the chicken starter we had was served pipping hot and very tasty the main was served with obvious fresh vegetables and again tasty fresh and hot the prices were good starters from 4 8 quid and mains from around 9 quid upward sides a couple of quid service was quick friendly and efficient a meal for two with starters mains and a beer was basically 50 quid not bad for central london in summary food quality superb taste very service quick and efficient value not bad fair prices hope this helps ,1
fantastic helpful friendly staff food perfect wine nice and sensibly priced wish we found before will be back,1
lovely little restaurant with delicious food reasonable pricing and pleasant staff easy walking distance from victoria station thursday evening it was buzzing white wine needs to be chilled more the main courses arrived shortly after the starters so a little erratic it s a noisy restaurant when full ,1
close to victoria station this little outlet serves fresh and authentic korean fare not a very extensive menu but adequate sampling of all the old favorites their bulgogi and bimbimbap are both excellent and the portions more than adequte fairly quick service with a smile and helpful staff would go again,1
i used trip advisor to find a restaurant suitable for a theatre dinner lime orange seemed a good choice and we were delighted with this tiny place i would never have entered the restaurant had it been by looks alone as the exterior is not very inviting but once inside the door the room was clean quite smart and we were shown to our table by a very polite and friendly waiter we got a table at 5 30 with ease and soon after the tiny restaurant quickly filled up we were given advice about food choices the bbq chicken was delicious and sizzlingly hot and the pork bibimbap was equally good although we ordered rice with the chicken we didn t need it as we shared both dishes and there was plenty for two ladies the service was very quick and friendly as they are very used to people going to the apollo victoria theatre which is immediately across the road ignore google maps advice as that will direct you to the back entrance ,1
the exterior of this korean fusion restaurant is rather uninspiring do not be put off by this we had read reviews online so knew it had a good reputation we were not disappointed from the moment we met our charming host and were led to our table and through the variety of dishes we felt relaxed and welcome the food was delicious we shared a dish of kimchi followed by hot stone pot biminbap and a spicy chicken bulgogi with fresh lettuce on the side we arrived early pre show and did not reserve a table from 18 30 it would be necessary to book as the restaurant filled up rapidly it was a thoroughly enjoyable meal ,1
on the 11th of july 2016 we had tickets to see the wicked theatre show after picking up our tickets at the box office we were looking for a quick but good quality meal before seats opened for the show and a place close to the apollo victoria theatre based on tripadvisor reviews we chose to visit lime orange with a family of four two adults and two daughters one hour before seats open for wicked we ordered fried calamari for starters then bibimbap soup and noodles with fried chicken everything was tasty and stupendous in flavour texture and temperature it was our first experience with korean food but based on this first encounter i m sure more will follow our daughters who at first protested as we were visiting asian again really loved the tasty food service was fast and helpful and accommodating highly recommended ,1
definitely worthy going there it is always busy in fact i went there with 3 girlfriend and we really enjoyed the food the portion are medium small ,1
my first experience of korean food but had my friend and helpful waiter to guide me food was excellent and full of flavour portions generous slightly disconcerted about starters and mains etc arriving all at the same time we went for lunch and place was very busy you can book but only by phone prices are very reasonable and a stones throw from victoria station a great find and will return ,1
the menu consists of the standard fare bulgogi and bibimbap but the preparation and flavors here are spectacular the beef appetizer in particular was scrumptious prices reasonable and service very cheerful seating is typically rustic korean with lots of wood ,1
not only is the food fantastic and delicious but the customer service was above and beyond when my 9 year old couldn t finish her noodles they not only made up a doggy bag but held onto it for us when we went to wicked as we weren t allowed to take it into the theatre so she had the fanciest packed lunch on monday at school double delights we will definitely visit again i loved my bimbimbap dish and the calamari starters were perfecct ,1
i m shocked that i have lived in this area for over 10 years and have only now discovered this wonderful local restaurant it s conveniently located right next to victoria station but unless you are visiting the apollo theatre right opposite or are a commuter taking the bus outside the restaurant it s easy to miss vauxhall bridge road certainly isn t the most scenic road so probably not too many people just going for a stroll in the arae however i can only recommend taking a detour for this little gem all the dishes i have ordered so far have been excellent i particularly liked their japchae every day they have a different special lunch dish and for 3 99 take away or 4 99 eat in it s incredible value for money for london in general but particularly for this area portions are generous it s casual dining at it s best the furnishing may be simple but the ambience feels relaxed and somehow always has a calming effect on me even when the restaurant is packed this may also be thanks to the wonderful staff always very friendly quick and helpful ,1
the restaurant is conveniently located near to victoria station just behind the wicked theatre nice restaurant ambience and great service staff the food was also really good e g the bibimbap the lighting in the restaurant was a bit dim when you look from afar so i was mistaken that it s closed until i take a closer look glad i didn t turn away in the end ,1
food was amazing specially the sweet and sour calamari for starters and the bibimbap selection we also chose to get 3 selections of their grill and bbq my friends and i stayed for for around 3 hours with some tea and desserts afterwards and the staff took care of us the whole time and was very friendly ,1
had a mixed seafood bibimbap and if you havent tried one they should definitely be experienced served with several vegetables and rice in a hot heavy dish mix it all together for a great tasty meal,0
eaten here a few times you can t book before 7 and it does get really busy at this time it s near victoria station so maybe pre theatre and commuters account for this but worth the short wait for a table if necessary food is great value fresh and tasty the staff are very friendly too ,1
i visited here on a tuesday night with two friends and were lucky to get a table as i know it can be busy the wine was good and not too and the food we had was delicious we ordered a mixture of starters and then all had a main and we were stuffed full as the portions are a good size and we couldn t stop eating would definitely come back here the staff were so lovely and didn t rush us once even though we waited a long time for our 3rd party member to join us food came out quickly too a great wee place thanks ,1
it might not be the kind of place to take your bird on a first date but a fantastic place to go for a work lunch food is good some of the best korean food i have eaten in london decent price it can be busy so it may be worth booking ahead if there are a few of you ,1
i was taken here by a friend we shared two starters both were excellent i having never had korean food i was unsure but this put me at ease for mains we had be sizzling bowls of veg with an intact egg yoke mine also had chicken this was filling and interesting but not quite at the same level of yumminess but fully palatable and filling maybe owing to my own eating style by the end the food had blackened to the metal bowl and was less tasty to be fair this was just the dregs so shouldn t put people off the food for desert we had green tea ice cream the taste of this was excellent what was more questionable and i think a marmite option was the texture it had green tea in it so was bitty i am still undecided if i liked it my friend definitely didn t however two colleagues at work both said they love the bits so i guess try and see its only a couple of quid i would come back korean food was tasty filly and fresh ,1
we visited as a group of 4 adults and 4 children and found the service and food to be excellent we didn t book as we turned up when it opened but by around 6 on a thursday night it was very busy not sure if the staff were on different shift patterns but the waiter was extremely busy on his own for the 1st hour which was ok for us as we was the first ones in so no issues with service jap chae glass noodles was a bit small for 6 70 for a starter but it was very flavoursome bimbibap was excellent and very tasty bbq meat was also very good and tasty lighting was a bit dark which meant sometimes it was a little hard to tell if the meat was cooked ,1
i stumbled in the restuarant just by coincidence it was a good suprise great food authentic and the portion are good too it s a bit busy but worth it i recommend it ,1
found this little gem by chance doesn t look like much from the outside but the quality of the food is excellent and prices more than reasonable and their bibimbap is amazing ,1
i was introduced to lime orange korean and japanese restaurant a few months ago and it has now become one of my favourite lunch places the restaurant s ambience is simple but the food is very good home like cooking the staff are very friendly and ready to assist you with your choice of food food is also served quickly which is quite efficient if you only have a one hour lunch break never tried dinner at this place but should also be good above everything the prices are very reasonable recommendable but is usually very busy especially for lunch ,1
good selection of korean and japanese food restaurant gets busy early but worth the wait for a table ,1
tried for the first time today for lunch very friendly service and good tasty tofu bibimbap loved the rice crust at the bottom from the red hit bowl price reasonable and speedy service too will return ,1
my partner have visited lime orange on a number of occasions over the last few years and have always had a great meal the food is fantastic the staff are very friendly and it is good value for money as well i like how the staff are also happy to show you how to eat certain dishes if you are unfamiliar with the cuisine much appreciated the first time i went there ,1
looking for a byte before wicked found this place the service was polite quick and efficient the food special and tasty started with vegi dumplings which were excellent following came a bibimbap that exploded with flavors an ice cream made from black sesame was interesting and completed the meal the whole experience was good and right on time considering the fact that i ve splurged on wicked the cost here was just right ,1
i was the only non korean in here the night i ate which is usually a good sign i had the japchae and it was very good the prices were in keeping with the area ,1
it s far better in korean town the fried rice is terrible without flavor the field chicken is ok but fried too deep therefore hard to bite ,0
good food reasonably priced for london 35 head very small restaurant so best to avoid disappointment by booking service a little slow at times but polite and efficient once food order placed ,0
i ve not eaten any korean food before but read the reviews here so thought i d give it a go as i was off to see wicked which is just across the road i had the beef bibimbap which really tasty watch out it comes in a red hot bowl the house wine wasn t amazing but it was fine enough fab food served in an un pretentious little place it was pretty busy but i was on my own so not too much of a problem if there is a group of you it might be best to book in advance ,1
i went to have dinner here with my family and friends thoroughly enjoyed it was full service was fast and food was warm and tasty ,1
visited before the wicked theatre with the kids and i must say the food was mind blowing i had expected similarity to chinese food but i was very wrong the bibimbap i had was fantastic 8 vegetables with egg yolk and chilli sauce and the fun part was that you had to mix everything in to get the full flavour the staff were very friendly too explaining all the best selling dishes and recommending a few to the kids who had no idea what they wanted overall a very pleasant experience would recommend to friends and family passing by victoria ,1
went here for a work friends leaving do friendly staff help you understand menu if you get stuck i had spicy egg chicken noodles and boy they are hot not for the faint hearted accompaniment of seaweed and cucumber and pear it was lovely aloe vera juice and black sesame ice cream fast service fast food well worth a visit,1
a friend and mine stopped into this place as we were walking around the area just sight seeing looking for a decent priced restaurant that had some spicy options didn t know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised also note that they don t take american express so make sure you have cash or a different credit card ,1
small korean restaurant in victoria service is hectic but efficient and always friendly the food is good and prices are reasonable even unbeatable when it comes to the daily special ,1
welcoming helpful staff nice atmosphere starters of chicken katsu and veggie mari were good as was yummy spinach side both had bibimbap for main which was delicious only quibble would be being served main courses half way through starters was told would stay hot after stirring it was warm only as beef had gone cold would have preferred hot and not like i had to rush my starter as main was already there not great choice of puds but you ll be full by then anyway ,0
this is my favourite korean restaurant so far the dishes are tasty rather than just greasy and spicy and the portion sizes are ok you don t leave hungry the bulgogy is absolutely amazing although it doesn t come cheap at the end of the day as you pay seperately for all the bits but worth it they do lovely drinks as well ,1
we were late because the underground was delayed but the staff couldn t have been nicer and more helpful we had the bipimbap which arrived very quickly and was delicious we thoroughly enjoyed our meal thanks x,1
food was really good and waitstaff really helpful we were shown right way to eat the food as i was not familiar with it bibimbap super delicious ,1
i came to know this restaurant after a series of research in narrowing down the best korean restaurants that fits our criteria including price range location atmosphere etc i was a little sceptical at the beginning as there weren t a lot of reviews on tripadvisor for this place despite the high ratings to be fair lime orange isn t one of the most well known korean restaurants in town but we like how it is one of the few that s close to my friend s hotel at south kensington as most korean restaurants are gathered around tottenham court road holborn area the restaurant itself is very easy to find as it is located on the main road right opposite apollo theatre known as the theatre for wicked the musical price range is also very reasonable and the quality of food is no less than that of the better known korean restaurants such as kimchee the portion of food is also very decent for appetizers we had jap chae a small dish of korean glass noodles it was the best jap chae i had in london vegetable mandu 5 korean dumplings they were very crispy and a small bowl of kimchi it was quite spicy but it would be better if there was more depth in flavour rather than spice alone for main course we had a beef bibimbap a kimchi soup pot which actually gives you a complimentary bowl of rice but it isn t specified on the menu i quite like the pork that comes with it and fried seafood udon i like the flavours and the wide variety of seafood between the four of us we had a really enjoyable meal as it was a nice casual place to dine and chat the only downside for us is that the staff could have been a little bit more attentive by serving water regularly or perhaps just look around more often otherwise everything was perfect in general though the staff there are all very friendly on a final note the bill came down to 40 which was 10 quid pp you definitely get more than you pay ,1
lovely casual korean restaurant always packed and people queuing to get in friendly staff good value for money bimbimbap rice great and large portions also serves green tea ice cream it s very close to victoria station def give this place a try for casual tasty eating ,1
lovely little restaurant serving delicious korean food the bibimbap was fantastic and came with soup too the vegetable dumplings were great too friendly and quick service very convenient for victoria station i m looking forward to returning very soon ,1
we had lunch in the restaurant which is right opposite the entrance to the apollo victoria theatre the surrounds seem a bit basic but the food was tasty and the service excellent dishes are japanese thai korean and the portions are generous i was pleasantly surprised at the cost lunch for 5 people including a bottle of wine and service came to 16 a head which is amazing for central london just the place for a pre theatre lunch ,1
very nice had a salad with cold beef as a starter and a miso soup pot with seafood vegetables and tofu with a bowl of rice as main course tasty very friendly staff decent price recommended ,1
nice meal in a great location the food was presented well and was tasty i had seafood pancakes for my starter it was far too big a portion and would have filled me on its own i did not finish it the starter was tasty but a bit stodgy i did not like the chili sauce they gave us to accompany the meal my main course was a pork dish served with rice and lettuce this was tasty again presentation was good a two course meal for two with one of us having sake and one of us having two bottled beers came in at around 40 for central london that s terrific value the restaurant is quite basic on the inside and the toilets were pretty shocking they looked like they hadn t been cleaned for quite a while and there was a bit of a smell that s my main reason for not giving a 5 star review it s not a posh restaurant but it was tasty filling and service was good recommended if you re on a budget ,1
lime orange is a basic looking restaurant more in a cafe style with a unexciting low level view of vauxhall bridge road but despite that it was just what we had been looking for the service was faultless the food bibimbap etc delicious though the red chili paste was dispensed from what looked like a ketchup tomato bottle and came to about 15 head for lunch would definately recommend ,1
this was our first korean experience it was fantastic our waiter was helpful advised us what to try both my husband i agreed the calamari was the best we ve ever had the black sesame ice cream was out of this world we can t wait to come back ,1
i have come here for lunch many times but haven t got past the three favourites monday daily special chicken katsu and udon noodles wednesday spicy beef soup which is a chili oil flecked consommé soup with bean sprouts scallions bits of beef and slices of a mild winter vegetable i drown the accompanying bowl of rice in it both go great with a side order of kim chee the healthy cabbage and chili the total damage then is about 8 20 they do bibimbap very well that works out at around 10 the tofu option was my favourite they also do chicken beef pork or seafood only seafood untested others fine too service is quick and courteous place gets full though best advice is to arrive early like 12 to 12 15 solo diners have a stool and bar looking out of the window option place is near victoria station due to crossrail civil engineering project this area has become a bit of a food desert lime orange is recommended ,1
bibimbap is delicious and the best i ve had portion is huge staff are friendly and food is very good on a previous visit i also had the veggie pancake which is nice too highly recommend,1
went with a large group of friends after the theatre without booking in advance staff were very accommodating and the service was very efficient food was extremely good with a varied korean and japanese menu excellent value will definitely go back ,1
we went here for a pre theatre meal i was impressed by the way they explained what everything was and made really sensible recommendations the service was smooth and attentive and this was a great opportunity to try something new there was a range of different dishes and they were keen to help us choose something that was balanced for our tastes on a future visit i might push myself a little to try something a bit more experimental but i trusted the staffs suggestion to start with something i was more used to i will very definitely return here and i recommend the green tea ice cream ,1
i love oriental food and i have always had great korean food in london this one is absolutely one of the best for food quality and great value ,1
been here twice this month the food was amazing both times the gentleman was extremely helpful and friendly i would highly recommend this restaurant great value for money,1
coming from the provinces we were struck by the sight of young people having an early evening meal in working clothes presumably prior to going home the food is good and the staff helpful in navigating the unusual menu a restaurant deserving of its pleasing reviews ,1
i ve never eaten korean before i m always up for trying different foods i m glad we came here it was recommended by family knowing nothing of korean foods i just let my cousin order traditional dishes i think my chopstick skills didn t show me up either which is a self achievement i was very impressed with the flavours i will certainly eat korean cuisine again if i get the opportunity and wash it down with some korean beer sodu we had a variety of dishes side dishes spicy cabbage 2 different beef dishes and pancakes loved it all ,1
decided to try this place due to previous very good reviews on here and it s proximity to the theatre over the road we were not disappointed although the restaurant is pretty small narrow and pretty busy when we arrived it still felt like we had enough room and could talk without needing to raise our voices over others the service was attentive very polite and even though they were dealing with a busy pre theatre crowd we did not feel rushed at all the menu is quite extensive almost too much so with sushi chinese and other types of cuisine finding its way in but having not tried the more traditional korean dishes before i went for a bibimbap which was excellent even if i would usually prefer a slightly larger portion of chicken in it my wife had the salmon and we shared a starter which were both delicious and even when you include the drinks we still only paid 35 i would definitely come here again regardless of going to the theatre or not ,1
visited after going to the passport office nearby we arrived at 12 00 and 48 later we left at 12 35 the menu had all the korean favourites we began with rice cakes and fish cakes in a sauce and squid which were nice but nothing special we followed these with a pork and beef bibimbap the highlight was the cucumber kimchee with pear the cabbage kimchee was rather lacklustre all in all probably good for the office workers nearby but not particularly relaxing we drank a hite beer and a rice drink,0
the best korean restaurant i ever visited the staff is very attentive and friendly the food is so delicious the menu offers a variety of choices korean bbq or udon noodles or sushi every bite was so delicious note that you need to pay cash here no credit card accepted ,0
really good food and service we went for one of the set meals very nice photo enclosed they did seem to try and rush us at one point but we hadn t booked they didn t become over bearing ,0
i called up yesterday wednesday morning and booked a table for 6pm as was seeing billy elliot in the theatre opposite i booked this with an open mind and was blown away it s a very small intimate restaurant that appears to be family run i had the japchae to start which was beautiful even if i was the only person in the restaurant to eat with a fork my partner had the deep fried prawns which were massive they looked beautiful but our main meals came out before we d finished our starters so i didn t get to try the prawns for main i had the beef bibimbap i am so glad i went with the crowd this dish was delicious rice with egg tasty beef spinach onions absolutely delicious and fun because you get to mix the ingredients and add sauce to your tasting my partner had pork belly with lettuce taco style he said his meat was a bit gristly but the flavours were really good as were the dipping sauces it is very fast service here which was great as within an hour we had a starter main beer and sake in total we spent 53 which is a little pricey but definitely worth it for a treat the sake wine is delicious as is the asahi beer the restaurant picked up in business by about 6 30 7 and had a really nice atmosphere to it if i go to victoria palace theatre again i ll be sure to stop here to try something new ,0
we came here for a pre theatre dinner the restaurant is right opposite wicked the musical service was friendly and we had a good welcome food arrived within about 5 minutes of ordering which was just what we wanted the bibimbaps we ordered arrived sizzling and delicious generous portions and very tasty very reasonably priced too would definitely recommend this place if you re in the area ,1
good tasty korean food and cheerful friendly welcoming service at reasonable prices we d definitely visit again ,1
i was able to book a table the day before my visit which was a good thing because the restaurant was busy the staff was friendly and my friend and i didn t wait too long to get our food this was my third time eating in a korean restaurant first two in paris and i can tell that the food was as delicious and flavoured as in the other ones ate in my only bad point would be the korean tea i was expecting something more impressive with more flavours as for my friend after having had a not so good experience with bibimbap in another korean restasuranrt the one she ordered at lime orange seafood bibimbap completely changed her mind about korean food in a positive way overally everything was worth the 10 service charge ,1
really enjoyed our first korean meal i had a starter only which was huge the other two had a big hot bowl one seafood based the other meat the portions would easily have done for two the chili sauce was served separately so that you could add your own a vg idea very friendly prompt service and reasonably priced we were there early evening pre theatre and there were plenty of free tables we loved the green tea ice cream delicious look forward to another visit ,1
find yourself hungry in the victoria station neighbourhood and it s easy to get very depressed very quickly on offer is the worst that british megachains have to offer nando s etc and little else in that context we were very happy to find lime orange the fact that the restaurant was packed was encouraging so we decided to dive in i really wanted to like the place but left disappointed the problem was that everything we had was desperately bland and lacking in taste we started with the fried sweet and sour fried chicked the sweet taste of the sauce decidedly overpowering any chicken that may have been there then came the seafood pajeon korean pancake it was very anticlimatic and clearly undercooked when this was pointed out they took it back and brought another one after a while which was not much better we ve had much tastier in other places asadal for example then came the bibimbaps we had pork and beef which seemed to be what everyone comes for this too was so bland we almost cried my girlfriend had to shower hers in chili sauce for her tastebuds to feel something anything it was all just sad to lime s credit the portions are generous and we did not leave hungry nor did our evening break the bank did we leave satisfied that s another story ,0
me and my familie went london for holiday and found this place by accident but it was the best meal we had in london london food not bad but when you have deep fryed food and bread for 5 days in a row it has a toll on your body lime orange served real homey food full of flavour also big portions the spices and ingredients used was great we will visit again if we are in london again thank you ,1
cheap cheerful tasty enough said really fast paced restaurant with fairly good standard of everything appeared fresh and arrived at table within 10 minutes perfect place for a lunchtime meal if you don t fancy eating in your office or on a park bench expect to spend about 10 for a meal with drink happy days ,1
we came for lunch and all of us chose the set menu of 22 per person noodles were good and the main beef dish and the chicken were fantastic really filling tasty food will come back again ,1
i went just before going to a show which was round the corner and it was worth trying to get the booking last minute the meal was well presented and very tasty the restaurant itself is very small but bijoux and the ladies washroom is downstairs by the kitchen but not a problem very clean we ordered a bottle of rose wine which at 18 50 was a bit pricey but hey its london enjoy ,1
i ate at lime orange with a friend on a thursday lunch time the reviews on here and my friend made me expect more than it was we got a table eventually and they really rushed us through they kept trying to get us to pay the bill but we were still talking there wasn t anyone waiting for a table so i wasn t sure why they hurried us the food was nice it was yummy and reasonable for 9 for a lunch i don t think i d go back as there are nicer places in that area for the same cost or less ,1
words cannot describe this resturant service food and service was excellent i would like to go back again and just fyi they only take cash,1
had a quick meal before a theatre show food was excellent value and delish just a note they only take cash so be prepared ,1
decided to visit after reading good reviews on trip advisor glad we did the food was delicious got the set dinner number 3 which was delicious and loads of food staff nice too would defo recommend ,1
went here with some work colleagues as we wanted something to eat after work found this by accident and it was just brilliant great little find ,1
eat here last saturday prior to theatre wow place was packed with korean customers tucking in menu completely off my radar but very helpful staff proposed a couple of items great fun stirring in the egg to cook it exceptional flavours filling dishes cash only by the way book your table at busy times total recommendation we ll be back ,1
outstanding food unpretentious place to enjoy authentic korean food prices reasonable but bulgolgi dinner didn t include side dishes however the the side dishes ordered separately were generous ,1
i d walked past this place so many times before a colleague recommended it went on a monday evening and luckily didn t need a reservation but we got the last free table there had the seafood pajeon which was delicious and shared the beef bbq and bibimbap so tasty really good quality for money as well friend had actually been to korea and said it was comparable bring cash if you go as they don t take card ,1
what a surprise a cracking little restaurant in heart of london walked in full o koreans it was looking good waitress superb advised us what to get and when it arrived in a matter of minutes showed how to eat our barbecue chicken with lettuce and rice gorgeous fresh and tasty food 2 minutes from victoria station and 10 seconds from the appollo theatre treat yourself if you want something different,1
great little asian restautant with different types of meals on the menu flavours is full and good sized portions did not try the bbq but have heard it is good ,1
a great place for a swift korean or japanese themed meal a nice selection of classic korean fare all served hot and quickly using fresh ingredients and with friendly service didn t try the japanese menu which is much smaller as korean seemed to be the main event recommended ,1
this is s great spot if your in a hurry for super quick and tasty food nothing glamorous to look at but the food and price makes up for it if you like asian food it s worth a visit ,1
we needed somewhere pre theatre and found this place through tripadvisor it was a great find offering great tasting food at a good price i d recommend the bimimbap which is an interesting diy stir fry all comes in a red hot pot add chilli to taste and keep stirring whilst it continues cooking very tasty and filling and under a tenner ,1
i ve never eaten korean food before sdo this was a first for me the waiter was great at explaining the menu and what might suit me the food is delivered very quickly and is value for money however only cash payments are taken which requires a bit of planning i found the food ok i think it was a little bland for my taste we went on a monday evening and were able to get a table straight away but it did get quite busy towards 8pm so would advise to book if,1
good food and quick service the only thing to note is that they don t take card payments there is a cash point nearby but it s worth knowing i d go back to try another dish from the menu it s a 5 minute walk from victoria station ,0
my friend and i both wanted something slightly different so we visited lime orange for lunch during the week they offered a good value set lunch 3 courses and a glass of wine for 17 but we were already eyeing up some of the different starters my friend had been before and highly recommended it we had the fried kimchee tofu spicy fried chicken to start and beef bimbimbap and pork belly bimbimbap along with some cold kimchee and miso to accompany the mains my friend asked for lettuce instead of rice and they were more than obliging we finsish with a scoop each of the black sesame and green tea ice cream black sesame was a real treat ask for no topping it was fairly busy for during the week lunch service and the staff were lovely would come back again for sure ,1
went for lunch here with some colleagues i couldn t decide whether to get the 4 99 lunch special or not and ultimately decided to get something else the beef bibimbap hot pot it was filling and tasty one of my colleagues got the beef bulgogi special and said it was ok high marks for the spicy chicken bulgogi though i liked that the place wasn t too crowded even at 1pm and we could get a table right away the food was good and the prices reasonable the only areas for improvement are to start taking credit cards cash only and make it easier to get the wait staff s attention ,1
i have eaten at lime orange a few times now over the last couple of years as i am on business i normally dine alone it is a small restaurant and most of the customers are korean the first thing that you notice is the attentive service you are greeted and seated immediately you walk in by very polite friendly staff when you are ready to order a waiter or waitress appears straight away and if you look up because you need something else you are quickly attended to the menu includes korean favourites and curiously a sushi selection the food is tasty and arrives very quickly wine is about the cheapest you will find in this part of london one thing to note is that at present it is cash only ,1
i went here just by my self lunch time om friday and was full 15min waiting and i feel so glad i wait i order most popular dish bibimbap so so so tasty 9 20 for bibimbap and 1 5coke food was served in about 10min i was surprised due to so busy they do daily special too around 4 50 wow no easy parking around if you in rush take away it s a option ,1
i really like this place it s not a chain and it shows with the service being so friendly the food is excellent and quick as well i miss the raw beef bibimbap which seems to have been removed from the menu last time i went i had the full korean bbq which we cooked on the grill built into the table it was great i highly recommend the cucumber kimchee and calamari starters accompaniments ,1
their lunch menu at 4 99 or 3 99 as take away is good but could do with better portions otherwise their food is tasty and staff are very friendly ,1
good korean food located near victoria station the tofu soup and beef babimbab was what i need after being on the road for more than a week the price is reasonable ,1
this small korean japanese cuisine restaurant ist just behind the victoria station and behind the wicked the theater we enjoyed the dinner from the starters to the main everything was delicious and we liked it don t miss the bibimbap the traditional corean rice dish it was really nice as starter we got the spicy calamari well done the pa jeon pancakes delicious and we finished it with different bibimbap try it out it s worth it ,1
we came here to have a quick dinner before the show the location is very good it just oppsit the the show we oreder the rice dish i forgot how to call it it was amazing there are a lot of veggi and a bit spicy the food is very fast and ee dont have to worry about kate to the show ,1
my nephews and i visited the place because it was so conveniently located from the musical wicked and must say we all left very happy the service was very quick food bursting with flavours and staff very polite the dish that stood out to me the most was the chicken bimbap which is a rice dish with 7 beautifully marinated vegetables and some spicy sauce to top it off definitely recommended to people looking for somewhere to eat before the theatres or to eat in general ,1
a bulgogi salad to start was nice but both the main courses beef babingka for mw wife and tofu bibingka for me were tasteless as was the flavourless soup that accompanied the mains we had two cups of korean tea at 1 80 each and were surprised to find that there were no free refills also in all korean restaurants there are complimentary nibbles kimchi whitebait like fish etc here the kimchi was a pricey 2 00 if it were not for the nice korean people serving us this rating would have rated terrible we would not go back or recommend it ,1
it is still one of my favorite places in london near victoria station where to go and have a lunch or dinner i think everyone can find something to tickle their taste buds service is great food delicious and simple easy going ambiance please note that this place can get packed while not only me found this place as great eating venue prices are moderate ,1
excellent food always i have been here a few times now and have always been a happy customer the service is fast and the staff is friendly and helpful even if you aren t a fan of hot stone bowls i highly recommend the bibim baps they could however beef up the dessert menu ,1
the food is really good and tasty its a bit too expensive for regular lunch some meals dont come with any sides i e lettuce or rice so need to pay for that extra on top ,1
my first time trying korean food have been wanting to for a while and was certainly not disappointed ordered the kimchee bibimbap which was excellent very tasty and served in a cast iron bowl which was sizzling away for ages good value and seems to be well frequented by koreans always a good sign with asian food will return as soon as i can ,1
never told us it was cash only because card machine was broken until very end food was okay i recommend the bibimbap,1
very friendly staff more than happy to help and explain the menu service was quick and professional food excellent and very nicely presented price was good all in all would recommend ,1
right across the road from apollo theatre so ideal for pre show unassuming place which was practically empty when we arrived at 18 00 which made me a bit nervous but was full within 10 mins my first time eating korean food and it was lovely particularly the the kim che pancake starter which was absolutely delicious the guy serving was excellent as we knew nothing about the menu good food good value good service good location be aware that the mains are quite filling and having starters and mains and then going straight to sit for a few hours in the theatre left us feeling like a good walk home afterwards ,1
first time eating korean food and i must say it was absolutely delicious the atmosphere was nice and warm the staff was very patient and welcoming very recommended ,1
my friend and i went to lime orange on a friday evening for a pre theatre meal i was very excited about dining here due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews on google however we left feeling disappointed and did not feel like we had our korean food fix we started with the kimchi jeon pancake which was sickly sweet the pancake was loaded with spring onions and very little kimchi with the negligible amount of kimchi in the pancake they might as well rename the dish spring onion pancake with traces of kimchi my friend and i joked about the chef mistaking sugar for salt my main was a seafood soup dish with rice it was ok but nothing memorable hardly any seafood apart from the tiniest pieces of squid we ordered green tea ice cream for dessert the ice cream was drizzled with lots of strawberry sauce this was not described in the menu they should have served it on the side the sauce was super sweet fortunately the waiter was happy to replace the ice cream this time without the sauce the ice cream itself although very enticingly described in the menu was not good at all it wasn t smooth and had bits of ice in it it tasted cheap overall very very disappointed we went to lime orange with high expectations but the food for us was unfortunately a bit meh ,0
we enjoyed a pre theatre supper here last night before seeing wicked great food very quick service but you definitely need to book as it is quite small and popular with the theatre trade cinnamon punch was expensive for what it was small glass at 2 50 but generally speaking food was hot tasty and freshly cooked to order the stone bowl dishes are a must will definitely return if in the area ,1
for asian food this is the place to go amazing bibimap and pickled veg vegan friendly also great meat and seafood not the biggest place but always packed with people like me who work 2 mins down the road and cheap,1
visited as work colleague recommended for night out small restaurant so booking is essential service was friendly and attentive perhaps a touch too fast made me think the food was warmed up as it was delivered so quickly menu exciting and varied both japanese and korean options and waiter advised on how to choose and select options unfortunately i must have chosen a duff off the menu as my katsu chicken udon was far noodles with some deep friend chicken on it the special sauce accompanying it was i swear hp brown sauce still udon noodles were tasty perhaps i just choose the wrong food but rest of table said things were nice but not great unfortunately i think it s a case of a restaurant getting away with serving poor food to a tourist market it s right near wicked and billy elliot touch too expensive for what we got would visit one more time to give it a go and try some different food takes cards but reluctantly ,0
we visited this restaurant prior to a theatre visit having never eaten at a korean restaurant before i wasn t too sure what to select the waiter was most helpful in guiding me through the menu our food was so delicious with delicate flavours and spices the hints of lemongrass could be tasted behind the spice i was very impressed the desert iced creams were also curiously different in flavours but taste divine if i m back in london soon i ll certainly return ,1
first time for korean food and was not sure what to expect staff were very helpful and recommended a great spread food was delicious and staff very welcoming ,1
having researched a suitable restaurant for a pre theatre meal we settled on lime orange after reading the reviews it turned out to be an excellent choice and we thoroughly enjoyed our first korean meal the menu had plenty of choices the staff were pleasant helpful and the food was delicious highly recommended ,1
i used to work close to this place and have visited many times we went back there on friday night with a group of 6 and it was still excellent food and service it s nothing fancy just very good korean café food i e the usual selection of udon noodle dishes bulgolgi kimchee etc the star is the hot stone bowl bibimap dishes where you can choose beef chicken pork seafood or tofu with a combination of vegetables rice and spicy sauce the prices are very reasonable as well 100 for 6 of us with a selection of starters and 6 bibimaps including drinks victoria is a depressing place when it comes to food but this café is a real find ,1
great korean food in westminster i ordered a hot stone pot beef bibimbap it is really tasty and you can add the chili sauce as much as you like friendly staff made me have a good dinner experience i d love to be a regular ,1
nice restaurant waiter helpful in ordering we ordered hot stone bowl with beef vegetables and egg yolk this was lovely noodles with chicken in a sauce i was disappointed noodles were nice but chicken was in breadcrumbs with sauce dribbled on top not what i was expecting overall it was nice although not real korean food ,0
excellent service the waiter was well informed of the menu and the service was fast and the food was great good prices for a pre theatre meal ,1
my colleague introduced me to lime orange last week where we ordered the special of the day yukgae jang to take away we were greeted pleasantly by the staff and took our orders very quickly the service was fast as we did not have to wait long unfortunately the food was cold by the time we brought it back to the office we re not very far from the restaurant either but it tasted great given the portion size and that it s only 4 for the special i d definitely go back and try another special of the day again if you happen to be working around the area it s very close to the station and you probably have to wait about as long as queuing up to pay for a sandwich at pret i would definitely recommend it and i will be visiting again very soon ,1
my boyfriend and i were looking for a place to eat before going to see wicked during the last weekend of february and we came across lime oranage just across the road form the theatre we went in not knowing what to expect but we were met by friendly staff and a huge menu that left us deciding for quite a while we both took the bibimbap which came up quickly and was piping hot it was absolutely delicious and we both thoroughly enjoyed out meals we each had a beer as well after our main we shares some of the green tea ice cream another totally new flavour and not an unpleasant one either i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick pre theatre meal as you will not be disappointed ,1
we ate here due to the excellent reviews the food is similar to that served by our local japanese restaurant so we had something to compare it to the miso soup was thin and watery the noodles were lukewarm and tasteless we ordered seafood and vegetables but the only vegetables were a few peppers and onions the staff paid very little attention to us although when asked whether we d enjoyed our meal and told it was not very hot said they would have heated and took the service charge off our bill a disappointing experience ,0
we went here before seeing wicked and it was great it was bustling which was a great sign and deserved to be the staff are very good the atmosphere nice and the food lovely we ordered the bulgogi a bbq item served with rice and lettuce and it was great nice to try something authentically korean as well rather than the standard items if i knew people going to wicked i would say eat here good quick food and a lovely pre theatre feel ,1
enjoyed a superb meal at lime orange following great reviews on trip advisor our 1st experience of korean food and can thoroughly recommend ,1
we had no idea what to expect when we went to lime orange with friends the other night from the outside it looks rather unremarkable but we were greeted very warmly by the staff inside the decor was simple and the atmosphere welcoming the menu is quite extensive and we didn t really know where to begin thankfully someone in our party who had been there before ordered for us and we were treated to some truly delicious dishes the japchae sweet potato noodles and beef bulgogi were particular favourites with us but everything we tasted was truly delicious and quite importantly not over salted portions were super generous and we could have probably ordered less than we did but we re grateful we got to try so much next time i think we ll go for two rounds of japchae the beef bibimbap which is a comforting big stone pot of rice with meat veg and a raw egg yolk which cooks in the heat of the pot and the beef bulgogi it s not super cheap but it s good value for the size of the portions and the overall quality we can t wait to go back ,1
i love this place very small in terms of seating so make sure you book a table at busy times but it is worth it the service from the staff is great and the food is delicious fresh and quick to come out of the kitchen also as a vegetarian i felt there was a decent amount of options for me which is always a huge plus ,1
i have eaten here twice in the last month the first time was in a group of 6 before seeing billy elliot the waiter was very patient with us explaining the menu happily explaining what everyone else was eating as we were looking around he recommended the kimchee jeon as a starter which was delicious the tempura was plentiful i m a vegetarian and had the hot stone pot tofu bibimbap this is a bowl of rice vegetables and tofu there is a raw egg yolk on the top that cooks as you mix it all in with chilli sauce you do this yourself so choose how spicy you want it it was delicious the second time i took my god daughter as we were seeing wicked it s literally over teh road i had the same again it was so delicious first time around and she had the fish bobimbap there was plenty of different types of fish and she loved it once again brilliant service and delicious food some advice definitely call up and book in advance it s so busy and popular we booked both times lots of disappointed people or people who had to wait it s quite small so there s not lots of room to wait in also they prefer cash they do take cards so i highly recommend it great food service and atmosphere plus it s so close to both shows ,1
this is a great korean restaurant in the heart of london it may not look like much from the outside but inside the food is spot on everything that my party had was very fresh and clean tasting exactly what you expect from korean food perhaps the only let down was that we ordered bbq and thought we could cook it ourselves on the grill but it came pre cooked thankfully it was delicious ,1
this is a small korean restaurant it was welcoming and friendly and made you feel at home this was my first experience of korean food and it was good i particularly enjoyed the plum tea this is a good place for a good meal at a fair price ,1
arrived for pre theatre lunch greeted by the hostess promptly who gave a wonderful and friendly service first korean restaurant experience and help in choosing from the gorgeous selection in the menu was given with a smile the food was fresh and beautifully presented sake was a definite acquired taste but when taken as a shot disappeared quick lol i cannot fault my time at this restaurant and recommend it highly it opened at 12 and we were the first in the door followed to a virtual full house within 30 minutes so booking could be adviseable ,1
this is the first time i ve visited the restaurant and wasn t disappointed it s a fairly small restaurant and as we went there early on a tuesday we didn t have an issue getting a table the restaurant is a stones throw from the entrance of victoria station so nearby for the apollo theatre the waiters were helpful and showed my friend how best to eat her dish and also added advice as to how to make mine taste the best the advice was gratefully received i went for the tofu bibbimap which was very tasty and it was nice not to have plain tofu the dishes were also reasonably priced along with the beer too ,1
my daughter and i visted lime orange pre theatre after i saw the good reviews on tripadvisor im glad to say we were not disappointed the restaurant is small but despite there being a lot of diners it didnt feel crowded the waiter who served us was friendly and welcoming offering tips on the food the food was amazing i had seafood bibimbap which was delicious packed with flavour and came with chilli sauce to add to taste my daughter had katsu udon noodles which we both agreed was the best katsu we had tasted and there was plenty of it the prices were really reasonable too approx 8 10 for a main meal and soft drinks a bargain at 1 50 our new years resolution is now to learn how to use chop sticks as we were too embarrassed to ask for a fork thank you for a lovely dining experience which was one of the highlights of our trip ,1
i was really pleasantly surprised by lime orange it s quite small and on a busy road you d easily miss it but a friend took me and assured me it was delicious the staff were friendly and gave lots of useful information about the dishes the menu was varied quality was great i opted for chicken bibimbap which was fun and tasty the prices are really good especially considering the central location i ll certainly be going back ,1
this restaurant is tucked behind wicked the show in victoria i had the king prawns for starters that were cooked in a tempura batter they were huge and delicious for main i had the chicken biibimbap which was absolutely lovely very flavoursome very reasonable prices the staff were attentive but not too much thankfully i cannot recommend this little restaurant highly enough if you want good tasty korean food this is the place for you probably best to book first as it gets very busy ,1
i have to say this is one of the best korean restaurants i have been to just a few minutes from victoria station and theaters around i had the beef bibimpap and kimchee on the side it was fresh authentic and delicious after travelling through europe for a week and living on junk this was the best to home cook meal i have had the staff are nice the place is very neat and prices great highly recommended,1
we ve been to lime orange 3 times and we always leave very satisfied the bibimbap is delicious and very filling but the highlight of this restaurant is probably the korean barbecue you can chose to grill your meat yourself which is a very fun experience all the bulgogi meats are tender and full of flavour the kimchee pancake as a starter is superb as is the black sesame ice cream for dessert on top of delicious and fresh food the staff is great and friendly we only have great things to say about this place there is definitely no need to go to more expensive or busy korean restaurants in soho ,1
friends at work had suggested somewhere else to support as part of the amex shop small campaign but then i found this place and we managed to book a table we arrived and the place had a queue which is always a good sign we were seated at our table and given menus to begin analysing there may be a lot of there but it all sounds great and judging by the food we all received it s all done to a decent standard we tried a range of dishes including the raw beef bibimbap chicken katsu udon salmon teriyaki and yukgae jang and teverything we had was bursting with flavour and well prepared this is good korean food with plenty of options to include everyone now also very curious about their sushi too the prices are reasonable and the staff are very friendly it s quite a small restaurant and they do recommend on their website to book in advance having seen how busy it gets i would definitely agree we all agreed we would definitely be back ,1
this place is not expensive but very high quality there seem to be a lot of koreans who eat there and many people who are repeat trade dropping in for a very quick meal the classic korean dish bibimbap was fantastic and seems to be especially popular but it s a very large portion for one the wine was great too we ll definitely be going back it s very easy to get to very near to victoria station ,1
ideally located for victoria s theatres the food is plentiful for the price and really authentic and tasty the waiter was really helpful to our tastes would definitely advise popping in for dinner or if you work in the area they do daily specials for only 3 99 which is a super price for the area ,1
popped in for an early dinner before a gig and to sample our first taste of korean food we were not disappointed there was plenty to chose from on the menu and the staff were happy to advise choices to our taste we shared some chicken dumplings to start which were lovely i had the pork bulgogi which was really really good i had it with lettuce and rice as advised and costs extra you wrap it and eat with your hands yum it was a big portion and i thought the rice was unnecessary but the lettuce was a nice fresh way to serve and enjoy the pork and i might try it at home the other half had katsu chicken with udon noodles it was also really tasty and a good generous portion we were both chuffed especially as he works a stones throw and will be able to pop in and enjoy the lunchtime specials location is very convenient for victoria just a 2 minute walk behind the apollo theatre ,1
loved the bulgogi and some very tasty starters kimchi pancake was very tasty crispy and savoury one of the best i ve had quick and cosy dinner before seeing a show asset a nearby theatre ,1
visited here on a saturday night as a pre theatre meal ideal location as across the road from the victoria apollo it doesn t look much but don t be fooled we booked for 5pm when they open and for first 15mins we were the only ones there but it soon started to fill up so booking is a must the waiter was attentive helpful but not intrusive recommending dishes etc the food was lovely and very tasty and it was very filling i thought the prices were reasonable 2 starters 2 main courses 3 sides 2 puddings large glass of wine coke bottle of water was 55 inc service charge we will definitely be returning so sample more of the menu real gem of a place ,0
i visit this place really a lot it s so close to victoria station so the location is very convenient the restaurant is small but the food is very nice i would say it is pretty authentic for london i would also say that the food is pretty cheap some of my favorite menus from this restaurant are pork bibimbab bulgogi and dokpokki sorry if i spelled some wrong to sum up good food convenient location good value ,1
this is a great little restaurant only two mins away from victoria station and from the theatres showing wicked and billy elliot scrumptious corean food and decent prices very friendly service ,1
we visited lime orange for a quick dinner before going to the theatre and it certainly didn t disappoint the set menu two courses with wine and tea coffee was excellent came out very promptly and was a good price if you want something different to the standard fare around victoria i d thoroughly recommend this restaurant ,1
i really hope this is visited by more than asian people and people who have a taste for oriental food it deserves to be successful we went for an early dinner service was excellent and the food was amazing i thought po cha near tottenham court road did the best korean pancakes but there is a new champion in town near where i live i will be visiting here again and again the salmon dish was top tier as well ,1
wasn t too hungry but had a hour or two to kill so went in for a snack and a glass of wine we were recommended 4 starters which were all delicious especially the spicy calamari the place was almost empty when we went in but filled up very fast lucky we went in so early recommending to people who are looking for somewhere to eat before their show ,1
not much need to be said excellent food with excellent service plain welcoming decoration would definitely go back ,1
hello just about to get the gatwick express to gatwick and thought i would try and find a decent meal first i did nice food and a bit different to standard curry and thai worth a visit staff very nice and was quick service ,1
my friend and i brought a couple of friends from croatia who never had korean food before here it was rather late at night when we arrived around 9pm i ordered a spicy seafood noodle while the rest of them stone pot bibimpap dinner was absolutely lovely and we had a great time chatting even after finishing our meal we stayed in lime orange until all other diners have left we left the restaurant at 10 50pm and then we noticed the closing time was 10 30pm how kind was the staff not to patronise us regarding the closing hour we were so grateful and slightly embarrassed for keeping her so late i m regretting not to apologising to her back then i might do so the next time i come to lime orange again ,1
ordered prawn tuigim and spicy calamari for starters both arrived in record time and we watched as the restaurant filled up equally fast the food was tasty and good we also ordered beef bibimbap and beef bulgogi the waiter recommended lettuce and rice with the beef bulgogi and neglected to mention there was an extra charge for both the rice and the lettuce there was also a 10 service charge added to the bill i suggested he add a statement to the menu noting the extra charge for the rice and the lettuce he good naturedly removed the excess charges the 10 service charge was not amended and no record of our meal was provided following our cash payment we would eat here again in spite of non disclosure of costs involved ,1
i just loved this place foods were great and lovely service i m so glad that we made the effort to go there ,1
i have eaten here twice both times with a friend the first time i thought the food was pretty good especially the starter of spicy calamari my main of beef bulgogi was a bit too salty and didn t come with any lettuce my second visit was a few weeks later again i ordered the spicy calamari which was pretty good but this time i went for the beef bibimbap and found it very bland also both times the service wasn t very good i waited a very long time both times before anyone came to take our orders also one of the times we were running late by about 10 minutes as we were on the tube we didn t have signal to ring ahead and let them know as we arrived the waitress very sacasrtically said we re a bit late aren t you i wasn t impressed i don t think i ll be returning here as there are many better korean restaurants in central london ,0
i popped in for a quick post work feed the staff were friendly and helpful the atmosphere unpretentious and relaxed the food most importantly was brilliant i had the calamari some of the best i have had the kimchee which is not to everyone s taste but worth a try then the bibimbap which was incredibly tasty great value service and food perfect for a quick feed before a late train from victoria enjoy ,1
my colleagues and i found ourselves in sw1 for an evening before a trade show and all agreed we should try something different being a tripadviser geek nowadays i took charge and came across lime orange with positive reviews and nobody being overly au fait with korean food it was decided that lime orange would be the place for us despite some recent rather derogatory reviews i m pleased to say that our experience was a overall a positive one the restaurant itself is pretty basic but clean and welcoming which is unfortunately not a given late ish on a tuesday night in london the staff were friendly and accommodating at the beginning having not tried korean before our likes and dislikes were taken into account before recommendations were offered for starters and mains but after that i would have to say that service was average at best although the food service was rather slow especially considering we were one of four tables in that evening i would never complain when the food is as good as it was however we did outline upon arrival at 8 30pm that our colleague needed to leave at 9 45pm for a conference call but come 9 40pm he still didn t have his main meal not a problem normally but our circumstances meant this caused quite the issue what irked me the most was the general service which was a shame after such a positive start in between serving and going to kitchen the staff stood with their back to the restaurant chatting among themselves by the till this made it nigh on impossible to place a drinks order and it took me leaning across into their conversation to get their attention for the water we had ordered 10 minutes earlier the restaurant bills itself as korean bbq and there are even gas grills built into some of the tables our table had one but the only downer of taking the recommendations were that none of our dishes incorporated a bbq element which in hindsight seemed odd and an opportunity missed by the staff service aside it must said the food was very very good everything was fresh tasty and the we all thoroughly enjoyed every dish we shared from the pickled beansprouts vegetable dumplings extremely refreshing cucumber dish to the lemon chicken noodles and beef to name but a few i think we over ordered somewhat another big bonus was the price 4 people multiple bottles of beer wine two courses each and sharing sides all came in at a very reasonable price of around 20 per head these two final points are the reason i have bumped this up from average to very good poor service can easily be corrected and can be down to the individuals on the night but food of this quality at this price deserves to be shouted about ,0
we ordered beef bulgogi which the menu said it had fruits in it it came just with fried beef and a few pieces of capsicum in it for 9 20 the food gave me a tummy ache after that the service was appalling the guy at the counter was on his phone without a care in the world he was quite smelly as well i will never go that way in my life again absolute rip off i m sorry to write this but it was rubbish and waste of money i don t know how people are putting good reviews on this ,0
this is a small korean eatery which is very popular with korean tourists we were walking around victoria area and decided to give it a try it was crowded and we are lucky to get a table the service staff is courteous but they tend to be overwhelmed but the crowd so be patient with them price is reasonable ps order a delicious chicken soup which you have to wait for 30mins email me if you want to know the item on menu ,1
very good korean food bibimbap is very good and the mixed b b q bulgogi is not as good recommande with soju ,1
i ve been to a fair few korean places in london whilst it may lack the homely atmosphere of some places it makes up for it with its delicious food i had a kimchee pancake and chicken bibimbap both were brilliant in taste texture and flavour simply delicious i wasn t even hugely hungry but i somehow managed to finish the entire bibimbap which was quite large the prices are also reasonable given the central london location it s so close to victoria station which is very convenient and i ll definitely be returning soon to try out more of the menu ,1
the food was amazing big variety of dishes to choose from staff were attentive and polite without being invasive very nice atmosphere in the restaurant very good value for money ,1
we booked this restaurant based on all the positive reviews unfortunately we found nothing positive about the food we ordered the rib eye steak and salmon teriyaki from the grill section as you don t get anything with either dish we both ordered a bowl of sticky rice each the steak was tiny overcooked and fatty and the rice was just plain nothing to write home about although the salmon was a good size it just tasted burnt and was in a pool of soy sauce overall the food was very disappointing the staff were not very helpful it was a big disapointment after all the good reviews it got we were both still hungry so had to get a burger from mcdonalds before going to the theatre ,0
just across the road from the victoria apollo it couldn t be handier we looked at the italian next door but the prices were steeper than the lime orange the menu was varied and had plenty to choose from so all tastes are catered for i would have given 5 stars except my beer came in a dirty glass and the service while not bad could have been a little better the young waiter was helpful keen and took time to explain the dishes we were served by two staff so the quality varied from ok to very good the food was tasty and plentiful and though the restaurant was filling up we did not feel rushed worth a try ,1
we stumbled on this place and were so happy with our discovery the food was hot delicious and came quickly we were there pretty early 6pm for the price there was a good amount of food especially compared to the italian next door yummy main meal for under 10 pounds the waiting staff were very friendly and we will be going back next time we re in london for a show ,1
i tried this restaurant after reading the reviews on here i was most disappointed we were the 1st in the restaurant at approx 5 45pm but the service was appalling we were not given any advice explanations or recommendations about the dishes on the menu we were served by 3 different people with the main waitress not talking to us at all when the dishes were delivered or removed the plates we asked for a glass of water to accompany the other drinks we ordered and was given warm tap water with no ice we were not offered mineral water we asked for the menu to order tea when we had finished eating we waited over 20 mins and order still not taken also waited a long time to pay the bill so much so we only just made the start of the show we booked to see ,0
i found this place when i was walking around victoria station and the food is really good and the staff very kind recommended it ,1
a simple lunch special for under 5 tasty and really fresh today being thursday is a dumpling soup but every day is different looking forward to being in victoria on a tuesday for ribs ,1
this place literary took me back to soul to real korean restaurant food was good service excellent prices reasonable for london food has been brought rather quickly only as spicy seafood pancake was less spicy than in soul but other than that very fine ,1
stumbled across this restaurant by chance after the theatre so glad we did we were made very welcome on arrival service was prompt are ordering and having not eaten korean before were offered plenty of advice and suggestions especially for the children food was fantastic and delicious even the children tried something new for a change will definitely return well worth a visit ,1
went here on the recommendation of friends service was excellent the staff even gave suggestions of combinations and were very knowledgeable the food came in good time and was excellent and not overpriced would go here again and recommend to any one ,1
was searching for a quick dining place just before a musical and found lime orange it s a small family operated korean restaurant with very simple yet comfortable decor wait staff was approachable yet not intrusive left us to look through the menu until we were ready to order when asked for recommendation he was able to suggest a few dishes which were very much enjoyable we had seafood pancake kimchi hot pot and beef bibimbap simple comfort food which made such a wonderful dining experience for us i would recommend any one who likes a simple korean dining experience and those catching a musical with an hour to spare ,1
i don t normally write reviews but it just has to be done the lady who owns the restaurant needs to stop telling us when and how we put siracha on our bibimbaps how we should be doing with the food we are eating it has been occasions where she has purposely took hold of the siracha and has put it all over my sister s food to the point she found it too spicy if she is reading it you need to know when to let people do what the hell they like with the food they are paying for you may not like it but hell we are the ones paying to eat there i won t be going there because of another attempt of eating there she has tried to smother my food with siracha when i told her no i do not recommend this place to people who just want to eat how they want ,0
really tasty food especially the korean dishes lots of which are new to us the meals are cooked and served very quickly attentive waiters who are happy to explain the dishes give time to read the menu and don t disturb you mid meal asking if its ok this is one of my favourite restaurants in london as the food is simply so tasty and interesting but perhaps not somewhere to take your first date as the decor is a little plain i ve been back many times and is a place i like to take friends who i know appreciate food i definitely recommend it ,1
came here the third time last twice ordered bimbimbap which is nice however what i order today the teriyaki chicken udon was too salty doesnt really taste the chicken and udon but the salty sause small restaurant which not recommend for a bunch of peoples more than 4 peoples ,0
i m sorry but this is literally the worst sushi i ve ever had in my entire life if you can t do it better not to put it on the menu all the rolls are so loose that i can t even pick up by chopsticks avocado was so unripe very hard and taste horrible friend had the hot pot soup with seafood she says not very fresh seafood and too salty ,0
my daughter and i visited this restaurant a few nights ago for pre theatre dinner and it was really good our server was extremely helpful and efficient and the food delicious although the cinnamon punch was not my thing i will definitely return if i m back in the area ,1
i have been to this restaurant twice i suppose the experience was pretty good for me although my korean friend wasn t too satisfied it served japanese food previously but now i suppose they focus on korean food which probably is a right decision as they are korean not japanese i had pajeon and bibimbap pajeon was crispy and lots of seafoods are mixed too though my korean friend told that they already prepared it a while ago and reheated re panfried again now which you never know at least for me it was crispy and nice stone bowl of bibimbap was well heated so that you have a little bit of burnt rice that i really appreciate korean lady seems smiley and nice i think it s a nice little korean restaurant in victoria ,1
we frequent lime orange often my girlfriend and i always walk out happy the bip and baps are very tasty and filling the miso soup good wait staff very attentive the restaurant is an odd shape so you kind of feel like you are sitting at your neighbours table but for the price it is fine also have korean beer ,1
we visited here as part of hubby s birthday celebrations we had read the reviews on here but hadn t been before or even had it recommended to us we were not disappointed we chose a set menu thinking it would give us a variety of choice we had kimchee juon chicken bibimbap with miso soup then black sesame ice cream the set menu also included a glass of house white or red wine all the food was delicious the service was friendly and efficient if we are ever in this part of london again then we ll definitely go back ,1
superb food jam packed full of flavour all served by incredibly friendly and welcoming staff a truly superb venue at an affordable cost thank you very much ,1
knowing nothing about korean food we chose from the set three course menu delicious food nicely presented the food was obviously freshly made to order and ingredients good quality we were brought a jug of water without asking for it service on a friday evening was good we thought that under 40 for two three course meals and one drink each was very reasonable and we were certainly well fed ideal place for a quick pre theatre meal will visit again ,1
so close to victoria station very nice location and warm welcome clean also the toilette i have tried many korean restaurant an d this is for me the best food is delicious ,1
visited this lovely place before a trip to the theatre delicious food and excellent service obviously family run which adds the the ambience the traditional korean bbq is a must ,1
this place is a little hidden gem it s a small restaurant and can be easily missed but i m so glad we found it the service was very good and attentative and the food was excellent it was my first time eating korean bbq and the server was extremely helpful with suggestions and guidance the food was very flavorful the portions were generous the sushi portion was the biggest i have ever seen and very well done sushi the bibmbap was super tasty we had leftovers and we were sad we couldn t pack them up ,1
i visited lime orange twice already the first with my gf and second with family the reception was great they are always smiling and willing to help and the food was different but easy to please bibimbap is a must and i would recommend the korean bbq together if in a bigger group oh the ambient looks a little fancy but it s cheaper than a lot of good pubs and restaurants ,1
after a long day this was the perfect first diner of our holidays all the dishes were especially tasty udon chicken fried buttered prawns glas noodles even the fried rice the beef bulgogi was a special experience as you roll it yourself in a cabbage leave try the korean ricewine makgeolli cool and milky the service was very friendly and attentive the kid s special wishes and dietary changes were gladly accepted we will for sure come again ,1
if you are seeking a quick and reasonably priced bibimbap or korean bbq before taking the family to wicked or billy elliott then look no further this straight forward establishment is run very authentically by a husband and wife team value for money and authenticity this place is a good option with no immediate competition in this part of london for aficionados you might find the pajun a tad bit tired looking asadal near holborn has nicer decor and better barbecue but this place is good if you re yearning for kimchi in this part of town ,1
while strooling past lime orange we noticed that it was nicely crowded for a monday and decided to check it out what a great decision that was we shared the veggie dumplings you can pass on that but the bibimbap of beef was to die for one of the best meals we had in a week in london ,1
we showed up about 5 30 on sat evening and walked right in later it became very crowded the service was quick and the food very good by the time we left the service was not as fast ,1
we had our dinner just before a wicked show right across in the apollo victorian and were not disappointed the food as well as the drink plum tea yum yum was very good the only downside was that one of the two waitresses had to take a break or something and one waitress being alone in a well visited place was not good we had to wait a little to get our check but it wasn t that big of a problem also as usual with asian restaurants food marked as non spicy isn t necessarily completely non spicy so be sure to ask the staff before ordering,1
stopped in for a quick dinner before heading home and were very pleased with what we found service was very friendly and the food was fantastic something new for us but we very much enjoyed it delicious ,1
myself and my wife attended the restaurant prior to a trip to see wicked lime orange is directly opposite the theatre so perfect to eat beforehand when we arrived it was around 5pm and the place was empty but after reading the positive reviews we went in there was a very pleasant male staff member in charge we ordered starters and mains we both had the bibimbap for our main meals which is an authentic korean dish that comes in a sizzling dish and has lot of various ingredients and an egg yolk the waiter explained that you add chilli sauce and mix it all up yourself it was absolutely delicious my only slight complaint is that the main meals arrived whilst we were still eating our starters and we are by no means slow eaters but in fairness this my be a bit of a cultural difference and it didn t cause us any problems especially for the fact that the bibimbap came in a red hot dish so retained its heat the overall price including some drinks was 43 which i thought very good value for central london we will definitely return on our next trip to london ,1
i had never been to a korean restaurant before and i really enjoyed the experience very good main course for a bargain and just a block away from victoria station and its theatres ,1
i really enjoyed my korean experience and i would definitely go again take advice from the friendly staff as to what to eat the dishes served to our table of 7 all were beautifully presented and the flavours of them matched this price was ok and the restaurant is very close to victoria station and the theatres near by it is a small restaurant plain and clean service was good the toilets could have been a little cleaner and the space provided for this facility is very small but i am not really complaining just pointing out this fact ,1
the shop looks a little shady initially we were not sure about it but since there was nothing more alluring in the vicinity we decided to go for it to our surprise it was really good the korean fried rice was really good and spicy enough for asians who love extra spiciness had another dish with 4 types of meat can t remember what the dish is called but it was really tasty as well the meats were well marinated the only thing i really hate about it is the horrible lighting it was difficult to eat in the extremely orange lights aside from that i d totally recommend it ,1
on our second night in london we felt for some asian food i am in to korean food and my wife love the japanese kitchen we checked ta and found lime orange and decided to try it located only 2 min walk from victoria station it was very easy to get to we were there pretty early about 17 30 and we were seated directly service was very nice the whole time we had one of the set menues and some sake all courses was perfect and you won t leave lime orange hungry cos you get big portions it is in my opinion not pricey especially not considering the quality of the food our bill came out at 55 for 5 dishes and a bottle of sake i m pretty sure i ve found my favourite place in london here ,1
bumped into this place and very surprised at the food for a place near victoria station the place was empty when we went in as they had just opened but soon filled up recommend the bibimbap ,1
4 5 really tasty food at a very good price for anywhere especially london fast service too recommended ,1
whilst searching for somewhere close to the theatre victoria apollo wicked we found this great restaurant the food was delicious and the service excellent i have eaten korean before but this was the best i have tasted we had the korean bbq and there was plenty to eat for the five of us 3 adults and 2 children certainly recommend this if you are in the area ,1
stayed in hotel nearby and visited after reading previous reviews certainly not disappointed food full of flavour recommend the korean bbq chicken staff v helpful well worth a visit ,1
i went here solo on a monday night and had the chicken bibimbap it was wonderful and i ate every bite came back on a tuesday and had the kimchi fried rice it was good but not as good as the bibimbap my favorite part about korean food is the banchan so on the second visit i ordered the mixed banchan called something else on the menu and it came with pickled bean sprouts radish cucumber and the green spinach like vegetable it was not was i was used to what i typically love was not done right so skip this the cucumber was extremely vinegary and sweet inedible the greens and bean sprouts were ok so my suggestion so far is to stick with the bibimbap i ll go back again for that ,1
hadn t tried korean food before so this was a pleasant surprise the waitress assisted us with our menu choice and although i can t remember the name of the dish we shared it was a platter of 4 different meats that came with rice and lettuce leaves it was ideal for us we were going to see wicked and chanced upon this restaurant it was clean and all staff were polite and friendly will try to make a return visit as the bibimap looked impressive ,1
i did some research before going in to london with my daughter for a service at westminster cathedral we like to try out different cuisines so gave lime orange a go based on reviews on tripadvisor we were not disappointed this restaurant is at the unfashionable end of vauxhall bridge road and looks uninspiring from the outside step inside and it looks like a cafe no scenic views from the window but the service is flawless the food great and if you are new to this they will advise you terrific fresh food served quickly great prices loved it ,1
i visited here on a saturday afternoon with three others we all chose from the korean menu items with two of us having a bibimap an iron couldron like bowl arrived with the prepared ingredients in my case chicken rice vegetables and pickled cabbage neatly arranged we were given chilli sauce to pour over and then mix everything together i really want to find an excuse to visit again so i can have another the bibimap continues to cook in front of you so the flavour and texture developed throughout the meal each dish was flavoured brilliantly and tasted fresh while we went on a saturday lunchtime we didnt take advantage of the lunchtime offer as wanted to choose items from the main menu i thought the food was priced reasonably and i noted that there were some set meals starting from about 15 which included a small gass of house wine i definately recommend a great eat and so conveniently placed right by victoria station the apollo and victoria place theatres ,1
we discovered this place while looking for a place from where we could grab a bite to eat before watching the wonderful musical called wicked that s how we discovered lime orange lovely modern decor inside really fast wireless internet service with a smile and really really great chicken katsu udon i am a huge fan of udon noodles and rarely manage to find a place that makes them just so needless to say i fell for this place and went right back the next day even though we weren t going to watch a musical afterwards if you re a fan of noodles or asian food do give it a try ,1
we got caught in the rain when waiting outside wicked we went round the restaurants around the theatre and we asked each one if they would server us in time for the show the staff at lime orange assured us that we could dine in and make it on time to the show and even helped us choose items on the menu that were both good and quick to make the food was very good and the atmosphere was also very welcoming there were tables all the way out till the entrance door which made them very chilly personally i would suggested eating at a table half way or all the way in ,1
we had an hour before heading across the road to see wicked went as a family and our girls loved the interactive way the food was served and delivered friendly staff we had a set meal for two which was the large hot stone bowls and the mixed bbq with a couple of extra starters ,1
was invited along for a lunch with colleagues and the food was sumptuous grilled salmon and teriyaki sauce despite the modestly sized venue the warmth efficiency and overall high attention service levels ensure you don t feel claustrophobic at all would definitely recommend for a quick yet quality lunch and yes i will be going again ,1
an unexpected find outstanding service from very friendly staff food was outstanding can t wait to go back great place to visit especially if you are visiting nearby theatres ,1
just been here in my lunch break with a few people from the office it was a lovely lunch we had 3 bi bim baps and a large bottle of sparkling water came to just over 30 between us including service the food was really tasty and the service was quick would highly recommend for korean in victoria area ,1
the outside of the restaurant and its name are a slightly off putting but bear with it and you won t be disappointed we ate here on the wednesday before easter and it wasn t very full it could have something to do with the scaffolding outside i don t know and had a really enjoyable meal the waiter explained the menu and made some recommendations on ordering the lettuce to wrap around the meat which was very helpful as this was our first experience of korean food the food was excellent well cooked and tasty although i would have welcomed a gap between our starters and main course which arrived before we d finished eating prices were reasonable for both the food and the wine and i d definitely go back ,1
the food was fabulous and the staff charming and helpful i m not familiar with korean food and we were advised how best to eat it which sauces to dip in and how to mix the starter the two of us even shared all 3 puddings on the menu as we couldn t choose between them i just wish it was closer to home ,1
discovered this little restaurant prior to visiting the victoria apollo theatre to see wicked interesting menu with korean and japanese food the food was hot well cooked and delicious my fussy teenage daughters had no problem eating up their chosen dishes the staff are friendly too i would highly recommend for a pre theatre meal ,1
i visited here with my girlfriend on a friday evening the food was excellent fresh tasting and very reasonably priced i d highly recommend here if you want to try something a little bit different for dinner ,1
this is my second visit to lime orange and i have to say that all the food we had both times was delicious the service was relatively quick most if not all of the food is hand made and it was a nice place to have a meal before the theatre at st james theatre definitely go check this place out ,1
firstly the price was good and more importantly great taste good portion nice selections of starters and nice atmosphere after that i ve been there many times with some friends they all loved it if you are around victoria you should try this one ,1
unable to find a reasonably priced eatery without having booked we took a chance and ate here we had dumplings to start which were very tasty accompanied by an imported korean beer for my main course i had spicey chicken noodles and my partner had chicken katsu udon portions were large and the food was good and inexpensive we d definitely go back here ,1
had to try it once and what a disappointment it was with two people we tried 8 dishes of which 3 were ok a bottle of north korean vodka and a couple of beers 200usd in fact we cam for the show but because of the low season no show until october the staff was super friendly and nice not one male employee in the whole place it seems probably some male minders hiding upstairs to keep the staff from running away ,1
beautiful young women dancing and singing while you eat dinner i understand these women live above the restaurant are not allowed to go outside unless accompanied by their guardians lest they attempt to defect i was told they are selected to come to the restaurant for 3 years at a time sounds like slave labor to me i decided i didn t want to give my money to support slave labor or weapons for north korea so i won t be going back ,0
this was an interesting experience for me and y husband we booked a table in advance for dinner we ve been curious for a while about north korea and visiting this restaurant seemed like a cheaper and safer option than traveling to pyongyang we especially went for the show however we were disappointed as there was no show that day the waitress could barely speak a few words of english but we understood they re not performing anymore such a pity about the food it was actually really good we ordered kimchi rice with kimchi cold noodle soup and some shrimps with vegetables that turned out to be super spicy be aware they do like their spicy food there 1 bottle of water and two beers all for 78 dollars service was fast and apart from the uneatable spicy shrimps everything was delicious waitress are kind of weird but i felt this is because they can t speak english you can see they want to interact but they just don t have the language skills overall an interesting experience just the idea of meeting someone from north korea is interesting in the end you ll hardly cross one of the street ,1
i booked a table and visited this establishment a friday evening it was a very enjoyable experience with traditionally dressed waitresses good food and drinks unusual but pleasant decor and atmosphere comfortable seating attentive table service polite greetings upon arrival and departure no singing dancing show was featured this particular evening and staff lacked sufficient communication skills outside korean or chinese kim bap bibimbap and kimchi were of excellent quality and very reasonably priced however the korean beer was grossly overpriced i e a single 500 ml bottle costing more than most individual dishes recommended ,1
i visited during dinner time with my family reservations recommended as it was quite packed the waitresses are all north koreans and they are also the performers of this restaurant we ordered the cold noodles and some other dishes on the menu and it was delicious the north korea beer is also very nice but slightly more expensive as i don t think you can get it anywhere else the waitresses are pretty and talented they serve food and in between they performed on stage from singing to dancing to even playing musical instruments definitely a must visit if you want to experience north korea cuisine and culture without visiting pyongyang ,1
would anything bad happen to me if i give an honest review anyhow i ll try to be as honest as possible the service and performance is excellent but no photo taking is allowed thats as much as i can say will most probably go back but only for the unforgettable performance ,1
my family decided to have dinner at the pyongyang traditional restaurant having missed it when we were in yangon the food is good must try the traditional north korean style cold noodle the decor is typical old style the most unique was the concert put up by none other than the waitresses it was colorful lively n have a mix of traditional n new items watch out for the solo drum performance my favorite it was amazing to watch how the waitresses continue to serve whilst in between their costume changes pricing is relatively high for phnom penh standard but worthwhile for the experience note payment is in cash n they politely request no photos of the concert but u can chat n have photos with the waitresses ,1
a really unique dining experience the beautiful waitresses will take orders and serve you north korean dishes and wala they suddenly dress up and put up several high energy dancing musical instrument singing performances in multiple costumes a lot of effort good food nice show one of a kind outside north korea ,1
i have read about this restaurant and i wanted to go just for my curiosity the result was extremely recommended food is average good but the spectacle even a bit 60 s is great the waitress are at the same time the dancers singers spectacle starts at 19 30 and finished before 21 00 one last advice don t try to give a tip they won t accept it,1
i heard and read quite a few reviews about the restaurant and i finally dropped by with a few friends while in town the restaurant was laid out like a typical chinese restaurant with a stage the waitresses wore light hanbok korean dress and took orders mostly in slightly accented mandarin our waitress eyed us ratherly suspiciously when we spoke in english the menu was filled with an amalgamation of korean and chinese food with the odd dog stew unordered thus unsampled i would say most items are overpriced in this place but you probably already guessed it still the kimchi pancakes and seafood omelette were surprisingly tasty we had a plate of stir fried intestines which was delicious but chewier than old tires slightly disappointed by the lack of north korean beer we had south korean soju instead fancy that the main highlight starts around 730 ish after the first few plates were served the waitresses gave a warm up song and dance distributed bouquets of plastic flowers to each table hell i thought i was given one for being cute a chubby girl sat behind the drums and delivered a heart thumping solo there were dances in traditional costumes look out for the thin but dazzlingly beautiful girl who is the designated spinner her part of the dances include several whirling solo think of a female whirling dervish you would propose marriage to in a heartbeat dragging on into the early evening you would sample 60s karaoke korean songs imagine very tamely dressed korean pop groups a saxophone solo of the moon represents my heart by another gorgeous girl and some more song and dances with electric guitars we caught one girl finger syncing to the music and accordion the national musical instrument for dprk overall the night was enjoyable the food was great and the performance enjoyable and although photography is forbidden during the performance you can still take a shot with the waitress before you leave ,1
first of all i have been here once for lunch and tried pyeongyang style cold sweet potato noodle and fried rice with egg pyeongyang style cold sweet potato noodle 평양냉면 was really nice taste for me and i would like to recommend it to all who reads my review there will be two kind of cold sweet potato noodle one is with cool water with some sources and the other do not have cool water i tried cool water style and may be without water will be hot and spicy and my explanation is just for your reference but fried rice with kimchi and egg was a bit hot and spicy it was usual taste like in south korea it was not my taste staffs from pyeongyang was beautiful and kind they served whole time while we finish lunch and i tried not to mention about political issues i wish i visit here again and next time i will see their show in evening time ,1
i went there because it would be one of very few opportunities to meet a north korean while some others have commented that they felt ignored and felt that it might have been because they were from western countries i did not feel that way i felt they were quite friendly especially considering that the place was full and only a handful of girls had to run the entertainment change costumes repeatedly and act as waitresses the girl who played the yanggeum korean dulcimer and the girl who played the drums were amazing if you consider that all the girls could speak korean chinese and at least a little bit of english and could dance and play instrumetns and wait tables well it is truly amazing i was given a bouquet of flowers used during the show at the end by one of the girls although i wasn t able to take it home i have spent a lot of time in south korea and in asia in general and i can speak chinese so maybe i felt less culture shock in general and was able to understand some of what they were saying with other customers they could speak english also some more than others but that was ok because if one could not understand or respond well she could get another the restaurant is connected to the north korean government from what i have read the girls might come from elite families the politics might be distatsteful but a stand alone review should give it a very high rating the girls were very remarkably talented and were friendly the bibimbap was terrific the hors d ouevres were not remarkable but i can t think of any time in my life where i got a show a meal and a cultural experience for 15 dollars including a glass of ginseng wine ,1
north korean style restaurant with good service there are private rooms on second floor with karaoke sing possible ,1
this is a very fun night out with friends even if you aren t into korean food the show is great and the whole experience is so weird and unique it is worth it i usually am not a huge fan of korean food but there were several things on the menu i was surprised i really liked the waitresses are a bit standoffish with westerners and they seated us in back but one did come over to chat briefly and probably see what our deal was the prices are higher than in cambodia we wound up paying 18 per person we were six people but we had a lot of beer and way more food than we could eat then again they don t charge admission so the price includes the performance the performances are delightfully bizarre kids would love it ,1
went here for the show and dinner and in some ways its quite an experience by luck we arrived right before the show food was overpriced but the show was free the food was standard korean cold buckweat noodles sweet and sour pork ribs etc and was pretty decent the show however is the main attraction its bizzare like an 80s japanese pop music performance interspersed with random mini acts the girls sing play mozart on the violin do some traditional dances etc all choreographed to strobe lights and disco balls they pretend to be happy and laugh the whole time but you can tell they are not in fact its known they are basically slaves and going to the restaurant is considered unethical by some so three stars im american and went to see north koreans with my bare eyes one of the servers touched my hand during the meal interesting ,1
the waitresses are also the entertainers and talented entertainers in that they sing they play instruments they entertained us at our table the food is a variety of north korean and chinese so you take your pick the highlight is the entertainment which starts at 730pm so go early if you want to catch this session i don t know if there is one more session later on,1
food wise i would say so so and slightly over priced ordered 7 dishes nothing special with a bottle of soju and cost us more than usd 150 nevertheless people were mainly here for the performances it was weird seeing these young and beautiful north korean ladies performing all kinds of wonderful talents on stage at the same time serving the customers as waitress poor girls ,0
we went for karaoke night which was a live show performed by all the waitresses it was really really fun all of our food was exquisite the drinks were great i highly recommend this place ,1
our last night in phnom penh and our son who lives in the city took us here for our last evening dinner there is a mystery to this place that is hard to figure out the ladies are dressed beautifully and are quite friendly we ordered several dishes stayed away from the meat dishes yes they serve dog it was all very delicious we were the only caucasian people there and it was almost a full audience mostly korean men consuming alot of alcohol and smoking that alone was good entertainment apparently the waitresses entertainment are from north korea and live on the premises and are not allowed to leave it s an odd atmosphere entertainment starts at 7 30 and is excellent definately worth seeing it s not advertised in the city it s by word of mouth that you come across it or by hearing about it from a local felt very safe there dinner was 55 00 for 3 of us including 6 beer however we chose veggie dishes some dishes eg eel was 35 00 a little pricey but worth it to see the show no photos are allowed ,1
this chain was created to generate revenue for the dictatorship in north korea with 25 going directly to the family dynasty that holds power some branches have had to close down because so many of the staff attempted to escape and flee the repressive regime ,1
if there is a pyongyang restaurant in the city i m visiting i eat there the young ladies are extremely talented musicians and dancers and they pretty and nice they may struggle with communication as they do not speak english i spoke to them in my limited mandarin the menu is extensive but many people make the mistake of ordering chinese dishes this mistake will negatively color your experience my recommendation order a large bowl of very special cold pyongyang noodles one per person as these are not sharable and the kim chee you will not be disappointed and you will feel that the meal and entertainment were a tremendous value this is one of those extremely delicious meals i can still taste and dream of having again ,1
if you have a spare evening in phnom penh don t miss a visit to north korea this unusual restaurant serves korean favorites followed by a vivid floorshow operated by a department of the north korean regime the restaurant provides a source of hard currency a venue for propaganda and possibly more nefarious activities that benefit the dprk the large banqueting hall is brightly illuminated and decorated in what might be described as synthetic wedding party the food conveniently pictured in a photo menu was abundant savory and featured barnyard sea and kennel to table yes dog meat korean favorites service provided by attractive young women who also perform was pleasant and fast a necessity considering the imminent start of the show the fifty minute floorshow featured most of the all female wait staff singing dancing and expertly performing on a wide variety of traditional and modern instruments with an ear singeing over amped audio output most of the guests in this busy eatery were korean men but westerners and some families were in attendance communication with the staff is challenging absent korean or khmer and one needs to accept the presence of smokers minders and surveillance was that a camera overhead in the women s toilet ,0
good selection of more exotic dishes like turtle and chicken soup and roast cow s tongue then at 7 30pm the lights go down and there is a musical dancing extravaganza that the glorious leader would be proud of ,1
cold ramen is tasty a lil different than what i had in seoul bbq pork was ok worth visiting if you have time performance was ok most of the attendees were men service wise was so so waitress only able to chat after performance finished some can speak mandarin too ,1
being a south korean living in america i was a bit hesitant to eat here but my wife insisted it was my first time meeting north koreans and it was equally unnerving and exciting at the same time they don t speak english so we ordered in korean they speak much differently than south koreans but it s understandable the cold noodle soup they call it rengmyun was really good and made the authentic old fashioned way without any artificial ingredients liks msg they asked us about life in america and once my wife got to talking they wouldn t leave our tableside in fact 2 of them stayed by our table for the entire meal which gave me a bit of indigestion they were obviously curious in the end it was a unique experience that i couldn t have at home and that was worth the price which is more typical of what you d pay in america for this kind of meal as we were there for lunch we did not get to see the live show but i hear it s pretty good we did hear a couple of the servers practicing their songs for later that evening and it was awkwardly entertaining ,1
we joke about going to this place and having stone stoup and rice husk gravel as a starving north korean its a bright an airy room staffed with young nk women who are clearly living a better life than at at home don t think for a minute that this a social enterprise just a way for the nk gov t to get some exposure and money food was plentiful and well prepared if you like vats of kimchee with everything each of the serving staff participated in the show which ranged from surreal to cheesy to actually ok the korean zither player ,1
this restaurant isn t somewhere you d go particularly for the food it s really all about the experience it s more of a bizarre banquet hall with live shows every night alternating between rock shows and traditional dancing enjoying a beer while watching a 20 year old north korean girl rocking out to a manic drum solo is priceless also priceless is trying to convince the staff who are all the chosen few who get to leave north korea for the green pastures of cambodia that they should pop to an internet cafe on their lunch break and explore the wonderful world of google ,1
typical n korean food including cold noodles great place if you want to see a bit of north korea however the show had a bit too much chinese songs compare to korean ones ,0
we read the reviews and thought this would be an interesting experience well it certainly was we arrived early as advised and there was no one else there 4 waitresses came over with menus and stood around us waiting for our order none of them seemed to speak english and watched over us for a good 20 mins while we tried to work out the menu lots of variety but prices quite high a lot of large groups started to arrive and we got our food before the floor show began food was nothing special but the show was quite good seemed to be a lot of business men there leering at the waitresses and lots of smokers probably wouldn t bother going again there s plenty of better restaurants to visit in town also when we got the bill there was no card facilities luckily we had enough cash on hand to pay ,0
i took four friends to pyongyang restaurant for a birthday celebration and we had a great time the food was spicy and good and the show was excellent the women are talented and put on a great musical it was my friend s birthday and the waitresses led all the patrons in happy birthday and have him flowers it was a great evening and worth the money ,1
went here for dinner hoping it was the night they also did the performances but alas no show on a tuesday night atmosphere was filled will smoke and and mirrors literally mirrors all over the walls and everyone smoking so if that s your thing you re in for a treat food was good though i admit i played it safe and got a noodle dish the waitress brought over a phone book sized menu then stood right next to me while i perused it under pressure lolz i would go back if i were sure to catch the performance but otherwise take a pass ,1
