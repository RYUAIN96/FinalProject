review,P/N
we d never had korean before and i d been wanting to try this for a while we let our server know we d never had it before and she gave us some recommendations we ended up going with the beef bulgogi and the dolsot bibimbap both were great it is important to know that some of the food is season to taste so plan to add some of the table sauce and soy sauce to make it how you like it the appetizer sides that came with each entree were great too service was excellent and everyone was very friendly lots of regulars while we were there ,1
i really was unsure of how much of the menu would appeal to me at korea house but i went with a large group that order several dishes they were all excellent my favorite dish was the seafood pancake but really enjoyed the chicken bulgogi fried dumplings and fried rice as well i definitely recommend korea house it s not fancy but it s good food also the staff were great dealing with our large group and the food came out fast and hot you can bring your own wine for a 5 corkage fee ,1
absolutely delicious authentic korean food served in a no frills tiny space in an otherwise drive by shopping center on charlotte pike go early or late to get a table or just plan to take out the wonderful small trays of side dishes that come with every meal come first and are so good they ll be gone before your food arrives ours were and the bibimbap is worth driving across the state for ,1
the banchan or side dishes that they serve are what i love about this restaurant there s about 8 different kinds and they re very consistent in terms of quality preparation and taste i also regularly get the doenjang jiggae usually to go the place can get crowded pretty quickly at peak meal times there aren t too many tables and no waiting area ,1
my eleven year old twins beg to get biminbop on days off of school we drive 45 minutes for the best around ,1
dont go here for ambiance but if you want bulgogi mandy soju great lunch the meal comes with rice and about 7 seven other side dishes radish and cabbage kimchi marinated bean sprouts tofu egg dish sweet radish etc get a cold soju to split or barley tea split an entree because you get such a large serving yummy it s a good meal service is fast and pleasant plenty of parking locals koreans also eat here worth a drive ,1
quick visit for lunch first time eating korean food this place isn t big or fancy but it s small and friendly and the food is excellent i can recommend the chicken bugolgi ,1
heard great things about korea house and decided to take dh here as a surprise dinner for our anniversary wow i m not a huge korean food fan but dh loves it i figured i could find something here and boy did i yum e as recommended by others the chicken bulgogi was delicious don t skip the fried potstickers dh said they tasted like the ones in seoul he had the bibimbop and said it was delicious as others mentioned the place is small with kitchy decor service and food quality were 100 and top notch i m all in on the korea house we ll be back ,1
one of our favorite places nothing much in the decor but service and food are wonderful i will say that i ve eaten there more than 10 times and only have gotten the chicken lettuce wraps they re so good that i can t bring myself to order anything else pretty small place we only go on off times ,1
this is a small but very good place specializing in authentic korean food and not fusion they offer numerous delicious hot soups as well as awesome hot pork and other meats the place is very good ,1
korea house is a tiny strip mall restaurant close to sylvan park we went for dinner on a thursday and were able to sit down immediately i noticed that some folks were getting to go orders so that is an option as well the service was good and the food explained to us when we asked i have zero experience with korean food but i found everything tasty the side dishes are fun prices are moderate and parking plentiful this is a very casual place they do take credit cards ,1
today i went to korea house i was assigned to south korea from 1991 1993 and i developed a love of korean food i had bulgogi and several small side dishes like kimchi pickled radishes pickled bean sprouts etc the dishes were all delicious and the service exceptional if you have an affinity for korean food i recommend korea house ,1
i ordered the chicken bulgogi and the flavors were phenomenal i got it with regular heat which is spicy but tolerable to finish the meal the vegetables were mixed and saut√©ed well portions were very appropriate for someone with a large appetite rice was sticky and moist without being mushy there was a bit of wait as it was very crowded but i would say it s worth the wait they make up in quality what they are lacking in ambience and decor the staff was nice and quick ,1
my first experience with korean food i was skeptical that i d like it but i absolutely loved everything on the table tiny little place that stays busy very reasonable prices and the food is deeeelicious friendly staff authentic food and atmosphere love this place ,1
this is one of the best restaurants in nashville small place but the service is awesome the food is amazing i live everything about it ,1
our first time here made me wonder if i d ever had a korean dish like this before it is a simple restaurant i told the waitress i wanted something with pork and she told me to get the bulgogi my wife had the beef version many cold side ms served with it along with lettuce to we assumed use for eating similar to a lettuce wrap except these were longer skinny romaine leaves i think food was very tasty ,0
i need to be more adventurous here and get more than bibimbap or korean bbq but both of those things are so so good here that i rarely stray generous portions full of vegetables nice touches like freshly fried eggs on top and those steaming clay bowls are awesome they bring out a lot of sides banchan to the table for everyone to share good variety of dishes like kimchi bean sprouts potatoes etc staff is always welcoming and friendly all those awards are well earned ,1
hands down the most authentic korean experience i ve had back in the states the food is delicious and prepared by what appears to be a family make sure to eat your fill while you re there because korean food has the tendency to make itself known in the fridge i ve seen some complaints about service but they operate just like restaurants in korea do you ve got to tell them you want something and it ll be on the table in no time flat the only downside is that i didn t have the stomach to eat everything on the menu they basically have all of the classics that you could possibly want if i lived closer this would be a weekly spot ,1
my wife and i both enjoy korean food very much but it is very difficult to find in many cities in the south this restaurant was rated as the best korean food in the nashville area so we tried it i had the kimchee soup with beef and mary had bulgogi we were served the traditional little side dishes with our meal and these are always my way of separating the good from the very best the kim chee itself was on the rather tame side i did not request the really dilish hot stuff and am sorry i did not however it was very good and the soup was outstanding to the last drop and it was served in a huge bowl which i lifted and drained just like i used to do in korea the bulgogi was also very good the service was friendly and helpful and relatively fast and the prices were reasonable if you want to try korean food this is a very good place to do it with good food and a large selection to choose from i cannot remember the name of the red paste they always bring in a side dish which looks like ketchup but i can say that it is what stole the show for me here i dipped everything i could in it and it was scrumptious ,1
four folk for dinner staff explained all dishes even going into detail for the newcomers next to us who d not had korean food tasty dishes ample sized portions simple unadorned storefront no ambience at all save good food noisy when crowded expect to speak loudly and be heard by others at close in tables ,1
this restaurant has delicious korean food we recommend the bibimbap and the galbi they make their own kimchi and it is very tasty their service is quick and friendly the restaurant is busy at lunch on the weekend ,1
very small restaurant in a strip mall most authentic korean food ive hade in a long time their service is great but the food is excellent,1
decided to have my last lunch of 2016 at korea house i know there s a chinese new year but is there korean new year the iphone didn t capitalize korean new year but did for chinese new year so i guess not anyway back to korea house located in a strip mall along charlotte pike it s a rather small and unassuming restaurant we had a party of six and were at immediately but we also arrived at open i can see where this place would fill up rather quickly because of the small size as my first time here and i think my first time at a korean place i skimmed the pictures on here and got a couple tips from some friends who d ate here before i went with the chicken bulgogi 14 99 i wasn t sure what it was but the bulgogi seemed like the popular thing on the menu it came with a bunch of different sides we had a table of 6 and they brought out two ordered of sides for the table the portion for the chicken bulgogi was large it also came with a container of steamed white rice i mixed some of the rice in with the main dish and put a little of the sauce from the bottle onto my plate it was a little spicy but not insanely spicy i enjoyed it and would probably get it again if i went back ,1
the beef japchae and bulgogi are to die for and their bibimbap is toasty and filling great place for lunch and dinner go early because the place fills up fast the owner is on site and the staff are very friendly and helpfull can t say enough good about this restaurant ,1
i love korea house i was introduced to korea house 2 3 years ago and immediately was hooked wonderful food friendly staff i highly recommend korea house if you are looking for a korean food fix,1
this nashville restaurant is nestled in a little strip center on the west side there are about 12 tables and you may have to wait a bit if you show up during prime time but it will be well worth the wait the service is great and the food is spectacular very flavorful great sized portions the staff is very good at suggesting something if you aren t quite sure what to get the prices are fair food is great no excuse not to go there ,1
the food was amazing however the restaurant has won best of eleven years running i asked the owner if i had applied the correct sauce whereupon she took my chosticks from my hand and prepared my dish that was so awesome ,1
i stumbled across korea house by accident while in search of another location nearby what i found was an incredible eating experience i got so much food and every bite was good i can t wait to take my wife there someday ,1
this restaurant never disappoints we where all in need of comfort food and the staff at korea house provided it will style and warm smiles ,1
this is a fantastic hole in the wall that is always full to the brim of people who don t speak english you know a restaurant is great when it seems to be a gathering place for the local community of wherever they happen to be from the service is fantastic the food authentic and its all very well priced this is a not a fancy place so don t expect frills but do expect fantastic food ,1
we had family dinner at korea house and it was amazing food is the best takes a little time to get it but they always busy worth the wait very nice and friendly people wish they would expand their restaurant ,1
i have never dined in i just order it to go i always get the bulgogi with extra gochujang each time there s always something different included the meat is seasoned perfectly ,1
in today s world of cookie cutter chain restaurants and the thing of the moment menu items it is so rewarding to find a family owned restaurant presenting the ethnic food of their home country and they present it well and at a tremendous value four of us began with the wonderful seafood pancake accompanied with a sauce the waiter explained to us simply as pancake sauce just wonderful then we ordered an entree of beef of shrimp of pork and the kimchee rice we all had to laugh when we received our food with the companion dishes that come with any entree order we had covered every inch of our table with various dishes and sauces i won t list everything we ordered previous reviewers have listed their own favorites but it was all good and some great especially the seafood pancake and we finished every morsel no reservations so come early or you will wait for a table ,0
the food here is absolutely fantastic always consistent if you re looking for ambiance this is not the place for you ,1
the food is excellent and the staff super friendly the restaurant looked very clean with good light and seating the price is reasonable and the food memorable i live about an hour and a half away and have traveled to nashville just to eat here before they give you a very large portion along with the sides everyone at my table always leaves with a doggie bag or a doggie cup if they got soup the only downside is the restaurant is very small and everyone loves the place so if you come during the lunch or dinner rush be prepared to wait in line ,1
i would give korea house a 4 5 it can t get a 5 simply because of the atmosphere it is totally a dive that said the food is excellent the dolsot bibimbap is excellent the bulgogi is also very good the service is average the value is great i would have no problem giving them a 5 if the atmosphere was a little nicer and the service a little better that said i would recommend this place to anyone ,1
you can t get better korean then at the korean house food is spectacular and the service is great expect a short wait but well worth it we try to go at least once a month ,1
arrived early on a friday night and when we left at 6 30 the line was out the door tried soup bbq beef pancake and bibimbap bibimbap was the best all of the sides were delicious too tiny place ethnic feel great food ,1
delightful little family korean cafe this was my first experience with this cuisine and it was pleasant the kimchi fried rice with pork and fried egg was very good the portion was huge and combined with the veggies was an awesome sized lunch service was friendly a return visit to sample other dishes is assured ,1
don t go for atmosphere it s a strip mall storefront with a small dining room but the food it came out fast and it was wonderful the staff were busy but still friendly and efficient i will be back ,1
those of us in the nashville advertising community are a fairly tight knit bunch joe and i made a date for lunch and he suggested korea house on charlotte sure thing was my reply when i arrived on the scene joe was seated and i told him as i sat down that it was my first time not only at korea house but also to try korean food his immediate response was that he assumed i d been there with his cousin judy also an advertising vet and dear buddy of mine the place was shabby chic populated by diners who were largely seemingly korean a korean tv station was on the screens followed joe s lead and ordered the 16 dolsot bibimbap rice topped with vegetables and beef bits and a fried egg in a hot stone pot when our dishes arrived on he table they were literally sizzling the waitress with a beautiful smile had brought us small dishes of assorted additions to mix into our stone pots we mixed and blended the results were a delicious cacophony of flavors have to confess upon entry i was a bit worried glad i followed joe s lead with 16 just really great going back for sure thanks joe for introducing me to korea house totally enjoyed a new nashville favorite ,1
family owned authentic korean food the food is very delicious and in very reasonable price waitress are very nice and helpful highly suggest to anyone want to try authentic korean food with very unexpensive price ,1
my 1st time for this cuisine made even more pleasant w my lunch around the world group of 10 server jennifer was understanding about our cluelessness re korean food and kindly made a suggestion to help firm my choice and several others made the same decision yummy beef veggies rice served in a hot iron pot topped w egg the place is small and clean unencumbered by d√©cor but welcoming to an almost capacity lunch bunch who seemed surprised to see our 10 seated perhaps in their usual spots we ll be back ,1
this was my first time experiencing korean fod and it was great two of us ordered beef bolgogi and one of us chicken bolgolgi it was very good and plentiful portions the kimshi was amazing cabbage cucumber and other we will do this again looks like a hole in the wall but don t let that stop you from experiencing great food and service ,1
you may not give this restaurant a second look if driving down charlotte but it s definitely worth the stop the food was delicious and hot both temperature and spice and you get a lot of it some lunch items were served in a steaming stone pot that kept the food cooking throughout the entire meal the menu is authentic korean cuisine with nearly 100 options to choose from however it s not somewhere to go if you are looking for a quick business lunch lunch lasted about 90 minutes it s also not good for large groups go with a group of 4 or less ,0
this is where i take my family whenever we are celebrating i love to share the food of my mother s side of the family with mine my kids love to go it s a treat every time i don t know what people are saying about the service i ve been going here for years and always have a friendly face eating here you can t go wrong ,1
we have been to korea house a few times the food is consistently good and is pretty cheap overall i order the bimbimbap with beef which comes with all the classic korean side accompaniments it comes out served in a hot stone or clay pot so that the bottom of the rice gets extremely crispy which makes it absolutely delicious another staple we normally get is the beef ribs they come with scallions and a wonderful sauce on a hot plate i absolutely love their house made hot sauce it is like a korean style sirachai sooo good the only things we haven t been huge fans of were the seafood pancake and the tripe soup the seafood pancake was almost inedible because it was so fishy tasting even with having a few dishes we would never order again the food is consistently pretty good service is ok its not fine dining or even like a regular restaurant the set up is a little cramped style but is normally full because its probably the best korean in nashville ,1
as out of towners we asked my bro where he d like to dine for his birthday we ended up at korea house initial impressions were not great little strip mall tiny crowded room folks standing in line outside should have been our first clue the service was slow but the food was oh so wonderful like beef bulgogi bibimbap eight sides to share fresh ingredients served hot authentic flavors dynamite experience and would like to sample other menu items soon ,0
korea house is not about appearances it s a simple square dining room about 20x30 feet in diameter tables sit as close together as possible and you can sit side by side in the center section i love it authentic cuisine and native language customers make this diner a fun wonderful place the smells emitting from the kitchen are full of spice and flavor before you even taste it all the dishes i see make my mouth water i m having the fried dumplings and the galbi pork short ribs i m writing this as i wait any time i get around good food i get excited there is nothing better than being able to enjoy wonderful cuisine in a relaxing speed food does not need to be hurried and this one is not fried dumplings are perfect small enough to be bite size crispy and flavorful conversation and someone to share with might make it better but my love affair with the food here kinda puts that on the back burner main meal arrived eight sides and a big platter of meat it s hard to start the kimchi varieties tofu potatoes ribs just so good it has taken me a few but i m back to finish this up sides are never ending always a bonus when they are good i feel like this is an anticlimactic end but i am very satisfied this is definitely a bring someone back place ,1
the food is excellent highly recommend the dolsot bibimbop prices are a little steep 11 30 service isn t the greatest it was our first time at a korean restaurant so when we would try to ask questions they were short with us or would just walk away when the woman brought the sides out we asked what they were and the woman as she was walking away said sides we knew that we wanted to know what each one was so when she walked back by i stopped her and asked what was in each one and she just did not want to tell us i finally just asked if any had fish since i don t like fish and was told one did but i would still go back because the food is that good ,1
my husband and i love korean food so we are always on the lookout for a good authentic korean restaurant because we travel to nashville several times a year we asked around and were directed to korea house the first thing i noticed when walking into the small restaurant was the amount of korean people having dinner good sign if you are looking for authentic korean food second thing i noticed was how well worn everything was in a nice homey way another good sign to me we ordered bulgogi one chicken one beef and dolsot bibimbap the food is amazingly good so flavorful and spicy the sides were great i especially love the kimchi and the bean sprouts our server mixed the bibimbap for us and it was perfect we will continue to frequent korea house whenever we are in nashville as the food is great on a side note the first time we visited the server we had a young woman was not very nice she was almost hostile for some reason we ordered three meals so we could share a little of each and take the rest back with us to eat over the next couple of days unless my teen son gets hungry then it is one meal she had the nerve to look at us and say that s a lot of food and just stood there so what we were paying for it so why the concern the second time our server was an older woman and she was awesome couldn t have asked for a better sever she sealed the deal for us as we had planned to look elsewhere if the service had been as poor as it had been the first time she brought us boxes for our leftover food and didn t bat an eye when we ordered three meals ,1
service is so bad here go to hai woon dai instead first of all the food here is very good but i live 90 miles away and this is the 2nd time in a row i ve been turned away i called ahead since i was running behind and they said be there by 9 30 and it would be okay i arrived at 9 20 and the owner still turned me away the previous time i waited in line til 9 30 but was turned away even though i arrived at 9 00 i will not be back again from now on i will go to hai woon dai where the food is just slightly less quality than that at korea house imo but the hospitality at hai woon dai is worlds better they remember me each time and i only eat at hai woon dai a few times per year ,0
we used to live in los angeles frequenting local korean restaurants for some of the most delicious food on earth after escaping to tennessee we realized how much we missed that authentic korean flavor it had been years since bulgogi or bibimbap had delighted my languishing tastebuds that is until the day a friend mentioned korea house it was exactly what we needed yes it s a cramped but the food was great and at the right price we ll be visiting again very soon ,1
went here with a friend my tab was 18 hers was 29 so we split the tab and he has me rung up as 18 and then when i hand him my card he quickly adds to it to make it 29 and then changes my friend s to 18 so quickly you wouldn t even know it without saying a word these people are rude if not criminal i let it go as a mistake but it s grown on me i felt the need to put in a negative review it s upset me so much it s old korean man who works there at the register i should have refused but it s only 10 but the more i think about it the more angry i become because he did it so purposely and so blatantly and then of course doesn t understand english i do not recommend this was practically criminal the food was okay the younger woman is nice there s some old lady probably the man s wife who came up without saying a word and just flung the food down on the table do not recommend do not come here and pay with credit card this sleezeball will quickly pull a bait and switch and pass it off as not being able to understand english scum ,0
very good compact setting with ample portions unique tastes seemed to be very popular with locals,1
three of us had lunch and even though we only ordered two main courses we had way too much food we started with fried pork dumplings and a seafood pancake which were very good the seafood pancake was closer to a pizza than a pancake because it had so much seafood in it it was better after the waitress suggested putting soy sause on it we forgot that they put out complimentary appetizers and that is why we had too much food there were about six small plates with different things really liked the potato the fish and stayed away from the kimchi its too hot for us my daugter ordered a beef dish and i ordered the chicken fried rice i did t try hers but she liked it and i liked my dish i definitely would recommend giving this restaurant a try ,1
been to lots of korean places this is always favorite friends has the same experience as me after they move they even came back for the restaurant took one star off only cuz there s no enough spaces for large groups ,1
authentic food if you love korean food this is the place for you good selection of sides cozy and friendly ,1
not bad for a small town k food would prefer more choices other than red hot spicy broths for my child but can t complain ,1
the inside does not look like much but the food is excellent we had various korean entrees and side dishes and all were well prepared tasty and filling these guys give a lot of food so go hungry if you like korean food then you should go to korea house in nashville ,1
the food tastes like at home delicious and sincere there are relatively large number of side dishes we could also find selections that are not normally offered in a typical korean restaurant the owner is very friendly it is a cozy and humble little place with very good food at reasonable price ,1
it s the place you always come with friends and super crowded at weekend s night i recently started liking the food here because actually there are not too many choices but they do have good food if you know what to order ,1
i am a regular visitor to the restaurant usually at least one time in a week the food is awesome parking is easy price is very reasonable they also take amex which is rare for an asian restaurant this size my favorite dishes are 19 and 26 cannot have enough ,1
i have eaten at korea house many times over that few years and it consistently provides excellent food and service ive eaten in korean restaurants nationwide and kh is right up there for food quality and value the only down sides are its location a strip mall way on the west side of the county and the decor strip mall chinese with korean signage but where it really counts food and service kh delivers ,1
if you are coming to nashville tn and you want real korean food meaning it is made by a wonderful korean family that will make you smile each time you see them than you need to go to korea house it is a little restaurant off of the beaten path of the tourist area but not far from the great shopping you will find at nashville west the best thing to do is order two or three meals and share them with all who are at your table ,1
my fiancee is a korean the first restaurant he brought me when i visited korea is this restaurant the taste of traditional food is great and fresh the waiter is nice ,1
you guys seriously korean is one of my all time favorite types of food to eat a bulgogi bi bim bop is home cooking to me and i am not by any stretch of the imagination korean i ve had bad korean food and am not universally accepting of the genre this is not bad korean food this is seriously delicious korean food the ban chan are like little gems set in front of you to sample and enhance your meal and they make their own kimchi too it s perfect on the hot sour meter as far as i m concerned the only thing this place does not have which i wouldn t expect them to that i miss are soju cocktails if you ve had soju cocktails with the easy pour spout and the deceptively tiny glasses you know what i mean otherwise love these welcoming happy people and the food they make ,1
a hidden gem in nashville and a place for authentic korean food we were visiting for the week and found this place on yelp bulgogi was tender and juicy beef barbecue cooked with onions and scallions and eaten with white rice the bibimbop is a dish with pickled carrots radishes lettuce barbecue beef egg mushrooms bean sprouts and a hot and sweet sauce it was beautiful and delicious the seafood pancake pajon was really good thick aromatic crispy with a tangy sauce and small pieces of shrimp and squid in the pancake the soondubujige a seafood stew was gobbled up by the family all the dishes are served with small side dishes including kimchee bean sprouts tempura omelettes radishes and cucumbers definitely recommend this place ,1
we love korea house we have been going there for years and have never been disappointed we lived for two years in korea and the food at korea house is better than we got there we always get the fried dumplins wonderful and gone in a flash then we order the bulgoggi it comes with lots of little side dishes you put the meat on a lettuce leaf add the red sauce some steamed rice and shredded radish yum this is the national dish of korean and it is great then we also get kimchee fried rice spicy and tasty and chop cha this is a noodle dish that has meat and veggies it is lots of food but you will want to taste it all and if there is any left take it home for later everyone that we have taken here loves it it is in a strip mall but you are not going for the atmosphere you are going for the food we drive 45 minutes to get there ,1
i agree with all the other reviews this is a great little restaurant in nashville super friendly service and delicious food overall a fantastic experience we ll definitely become regulars ,1
as far as a mom and pop ethnic restaurant goes this is at the highest level having spent a year in korea during service in the army many years ago it was a delight to discover this unassuming yet eminently satisfying korean restaurant the kimchis are excellent the chicken bulgogi delicious and amazingly the kimchi fried rice is outstanding ,1
eaten there often service good food anything is great ,1
my son and aughter in law were stationed in korea and they think that this place has the most authrentic food they have ever tasted outside of korea i know nothing about korean food but the three dishes that we had were delicious and i loved the little dishes of relish that you get before the meal our waitress was delightful the next time that i visit nashville i will head immediately for this restaurant the food is healthful as well as yummy ,1
located in a little strip shopping area on charlotte pike in west nashville korea house turned out to be a nice surprise i live between middle tn and santa monica so i travel between the two areas a lot often driving i ve had a lot of korean in la and korea house rivals or exceeds many of the restaurants there the prices are reasonable and the service is good the decor is nothing special just good food i ve been there many times since my first visit and it is a place i m glad to take visitors or meetings ,0
our family loves asian food we finally got to try this awesome korean restaurant in huntsville alabama rachel was our server and she did an outstanding job three of bbn us enjoyed bibimbap and one enjoyed kimchi fried rice we enjoyed all of the delicious food there is plenty of parking and they were advertising a new menu we will return soon ,1
my husband and i stopped here for lunch while we were out running errands and we were delightfully surprised to have some really good korean food my husband served in korea during the vietnam era and he loves korean food so we always want to try korean restaurants this one is not much to look at and the tables could use tablecloths or even plastic covers but we truly enjoyed the box lunches we ordered there was a nice variety and even the white rice was tasty we will definitely be going back ,1
we took 24 friends there last night and they handled us with no time delay food was great and a lot of the friends it was the first time for korean food and they liked it the onion pan cake was a hit with all ,1
i had never eaten korean food before and had tons of questions for the staff including what was in their marinades it turns out that they are made in house with ingredients such as sesame oil and soy sauce and what all the different pickles and condiments were everyone was very patient answering my questions and when the food arrived wow it was delicious i got the bibimbap with the marinated beef in a sizzling hot bowl soooo good i highly recommend this restaurant ,1
the food is great here the staff members are always super friendly the bulgogi and bibimbap are our favorites highly recommend this restaurant ,1
the menu needs better descriptions 1st time customers do not understand dishes with just titles the staff seem to rush to explain the menu the kimchi was the best part of the meal service was slow and i had to ask for refills on my ice tea may or may not go back ,0
while the food is good to the taste the serving sizes are comical they are very stingy with serving size also if i dine in for lunch and get the lunch plate you get 3 sides but if get a lunch plate to go you only get 2 sides and again the portion size is not enough to have for the entire meal sides should be the same regardless to whether i dine in or take out also yesterday 14 mar 19 i ordered a plate to go and asked how much for a side of reddish and the size because the last time i got the little plastic condiment size container for my sides so i wanted to know if i paid for extra what size would it be i was told the ounce size it was no waiter tried to compensate by saying he filled the container to full for me well duh why should it not be full especially as small as it was not my ounce for the price i fully intend to speak to management my next visit times are too hard for us to pay for such small portions we expect and demand better from american style establishments and all should be held to the same standard unacceptable i love korea needs to revamp their portion sizes and to go orders ,1
if you have been to korea or just enjoy the food this is a great place to get your fix food is very authentic service was good good place for family or couples reasonably priced ,1
we drive 85 plus miles quarterly to eat here and go shopping the atmosphere is friendly there is a sushi and beverage bar with a large screen television just in case alabama is playing roll tide the miso soup is very fine followed by fried dumplings and bulgulgi kimbob california roll bulgulgi platter with rice kimchi s and go chi jung spicy bean paste if this place was next door to me i would eat here five or more times a week yum special note to us the food tastes the best with ice water to drink not to cover the exotic flavors of the cuisine yum yum ,1
i was out for lunch and decided i wanted sushi i thought about places nearby that served sushi and decided on i love korea i had not been there recently so i was unaware if any changes had been made as i entered the parking lot i noticed that the main business sign still prominently displayed sushi bar i went in and was immediately seated as there were not many customers i was given a menu and no sushi was on it i asked a server and was told they did not do sushi anymore as it was lunch i did not have time to go elsewhere so i ordered a spicy chicken box the chicken was passable but i ve had much better at other korean or vietnamese restaurants in town the accompanying dishes were for the most part not very good no sauce was served with the stuffed dumpling as you usually see service was okay but nothing was making up for the false advertising and mediocre food you can get much better korean at a better lunch price at several places in huntsville as i left i took another look at the sign to make sure i wasn t crazy nope it still said sushi bar ,0
one of my favorite local restaurants in one of my favorite cities i love korea in huntsville alabama is conveniently located on jordan lane it s clean and the staff is friendly everyone is treated to a complimentary bowl of miso soup and my go to here is the spicy pork bibimbap along with the delicious kimchi i have never been disappointed with a meal here and can highly recommend it ,1
first visit to a korean restaurant i loved the chicken bibimbap whatever the korean name recipe cooked in a hot stoneware bowl but i was not very impressed with the kimchi it was not very tasteful i was hoping it to be quite spicy hot as i ve heard people talk about kimchi so ,0
a group of us meet at i love korea monthly the korean women in our group know what to order so i m never disappointed they have a kimchi made from korea radishes that is amazing they also have numerous other kimchis but you need to know what to ask for this isn t the most helpful review other than to say it s delicious ,1
i usually don t go to korean restaurants since i have it at home occasionally i went out to eat with a friend we randomly chose to go to i love korea i was not expecting much at first we were greeted by a friendly waitress service was great overall i decided to try kalbi and it was great it had a very authentic taste and side dishes that came with it were delightful i am a regular at this restaurant now and would recommend this place to anyone looking to try korean food ,1
tried korean food for the first time here and i loved it everything was so flavorful and fresh i usually try to stay away from beef when eating out but the meat in my bulgogi bimbimbap was cooked to perfection at i love korea ,1
first great service i went there for dinner was fairly early but bulgogi was leftover from lunch the meat was precooked too salty and tasted like chucks of something burnt rice was good miso soup was good fried pot stickers were good pan chan kimchi was good thinly sliced vinegar radish were good other stuff were not maybe depends on what you order here and it was my first time here but will not give it another chance disappointed with the meat ,0
so a co worker invited me to lunch for my birthday i went online saw great reviews and the menu and decided i d try the bimbimbap the waiter however suggested that as a first timer i might want to try the lunch box though both are crowd pleasers i went with his suggestion and wasn t unhappy i got the bugogli beef lunch box my co worker got the chicken wing box with a side of beef unsure why my co worker could get the chicken wing box with a side of beef when i couldn t get the beef box with a side of chicken was the same food but what i got was really tasty and flavorful the beef could ve been a bit more hot semi luke warm but still not bad we got there when they opened at 11 and within 20minutes the place was nearly packed i wasn t too happy with the dumplings they had somewhat of an odd after taste but my co worker says he liked them ,0
we normally enjoy korean food and once upon a time enjoyed this restaurant but now the food is unsavory even the rice and tea taste bad and the place is tired and a bit grubby ,0
this is probably the best korean restaurant in huntsville which says more about huntsville than it does about this restaurant the food is authentically korean spicy hot the menu is simple too many korean restaurants try to have chinese japenese or american food so come here if korean food is what you crave just a note it was friday evening and the place was empty ,1
the two of us ate lunch at i love korea the food was excellent in quantity and very good quality although it could have been spicier the service was efficient and friendly the atmosphere is a bit dark and dreary the overall value was very good we would return ,1
as the title says i love korea friendly employees and great food and service i love korea is an excellent choice for lunch this wasn t my first visit and won t be my last ,1
came at lunchtime i ordered the bugulgi bibimbop my goto standby korean dish off the lunch menu lunch menu has a varied selection of dishes for 9 99 btw food was good and service was excellent crowd inside wasn t too bad but parking was limited bill after food and drink tax and tip came to less than 15 00,1
i am very familiar with korean food and korea house was one of my all time favorite restaurants for korean food imagine my disappointment when i returned to huntsville to visit my folks and found it had closed they had the absolute best korean buffet i have ever had this week i am at home again visiting and i noticed this new korean restaurant i love korea it is right across the street from the original korea house i had the chicken bibimbop in the stone pot and it was excellent it came out sizzling hot from the kitchen and the miso soup is some of the best i ve had the side dishes were three kinds of kimche fishcakes and noodles but were tiny portions which could have been a bit larger i feel my mother had the chicken terriyaki and that was awesome too i would come back here but will always miss korea house ,1
great korean food fresh ingredients and wonderful flavors the outside of the building may not look the greatest but this place is truly fantastic ,1
we love korean food we visited this place while in a business trip unlike at home clarksville tn they only gave 6 side dishes which isn t so bad but the portions we very small then they didn t seem to want to give refills on the sides we had to ask the gal bi was too salty and not as tender as we are use to the champong was a bit too oily but had a pretty good flavor the spicy pork california rolls were very good the server was nice except for the fact that he didn t come to check on us for refills of sides over all if it s the only korean place in town i ll go back for another visit maybe dr mac,0
after looking at their menu and hearing from others how great this place is my husband and i decided to try it for lunch when we walked in we were greeted immediately and seated in the party section in the back they were very busy so this didn t bother us at all we were just happy to get a seat that fast we looked at the menu and our waiter was taking our order in less than 2 minutes i ordered the bulgogi lunch box and my husband ordered the rice dish with bulgogi and a fried egg on top i don t remember exactly what it was called we received our miso soup and then our little side dishes of kimchi radish etc very quickly the food was great the soup was served hot with the little tofu pieces and the side dishes were exactly what we expected when i received my lunch box i was impressed because it looked and smelled amazing my husband received his food about 3 4 minutes later because we didn t receive our food at the same time we never got a check to go pay we had to relay what we ordered to the cashier at the front and also because the women next to us ordered some soup that smelled so bad like hot blue cheese that it was very hard to continue to eat our lunch without getting sick i ve decided to give them 4 stars instead of 5 the service and food was great so we will return and i do highly recommend i love korea for great food for a great price hopefully when we do return no one will order that horrible soup again yuck ,1
i ve been here several times and i m a big fan i ve never been to korea so i m far from an expert on korean food but this restaurant is clean the staff is friendly professional there are many options and the meals i ve had have been excellent give i love korea a try you won t be disappointed and you ll be supporting local small business ,1
it was a nice surprise to find an authentic korean food place in huntsville and it was pretty yummy lots of good original foods to choose from the service was nice the place was clean and plenty of parking prices were pretty reasonable as well ,1
try the bulgogi bbq beef bimbimbap stone pot rice the tofu chigae the jampon spicy seafood noodles you will love the little dishes they serve for free too warning you will not want to come here on a low carb day cuz you gotta eat the rice ,1
lunch box is my favor but today i give a chance to try something else the onion cake it was really good short ribs is my favor wife plate always got it for lunch if u love spicy try the hot sauce they have,1
only the second time i have eaten korean food it was very delicious and the food came out attractive and fast the bibbabi box was great ,1
if you like korean food you ve got to try thier bulgogi bibmibap served in a hot stone bowl comes to the table still sizzling white rice on bottom with veges and sunny side up fried egg on top reasonable price of 10 99 with all the side dishes besure to add some kimchi to your bowl of bibimbap husband had fried rice with chicken everything was great even the red sauce was good only complaint was the stone bowl kept the food almost to hot to eat will definitly be back,1
a friend and i recently stopped in to have lunch at this very popular korean restaurant we arrived at 11 45 for an early lunch and it was packed trying to find a parking spot was a challenge service was understandably slow but the food was very good and worth the long wait i had the spicy chicken in lettuce wraps plus the obligatory sides including a very good kimchi pickled daikon fish cake not so good spicy cucumbers and something with cellophane noodles and slivers of carrots the food was we ll cooked moderately spicy and delicious ,1
my wife and i went here last night the food was very good i had the kalitang and my wife had the bulgogi i recommend getting the bulgogi it is delicious ,1
the food was amazing and the service was fantastic even though we are not staying in huntsville very long i want to go back to eat here again i will miss this food when i go home ,1
food was really good prices was reasonable menu had wide variety service was fast and friendly it s now a favorite for us definitely worth the 45 minutes trip for us to get there if you like korean food give them a try ,1
champong they have that and a bunch of other authentic korean dishes just go check it out you won t regret it of course they have their range of regular korean bbqs but their selection of noodles and tofu was great highly recommend ,1
i stopped to get some for supper and once back in the car had to drive 25 miles with the best smells in my car i wanted to stop and eat along the way but that would not have been fair to the ones waiting at home it was so good love this place ,1
we love this place i was in south korea and this good reminds me of my stay in korea beautiful land and awesome people and food to die for ,1
i atelunch at this restaurant for the first time today and it was great we had the bulgogi and spicy port bibimbap miso soup and it was all delicious they brought a half dozen side vegetable dishes of kimchi and tofu mixes service was excellent lunch dishes were 10 each and well worth it can t wait to go back ,1
i have spent several yeas in korea and have eaten a variety of dishes from many locations in south korea i found the offerings at this restaraunt to be very authentic and reasonably priced the kimbap served there is as good as i have had i especially enjoy the kalbi ribs htye are not my favorite in huntsville but a very close second at a significantly reduced cost compared to the other korean plae two blocks away the servers are well trained and helpful all in all this is my go to place for korean food in huntsville and i favorably compare their offerings to many places i have dined at in korea and better than quite a few over there ,1
we drive 45 min to get to this place as often as we can the bulgogi bibimbap is the best love the cucumber kimchi ,1
i ve enjoyed korean food for over 30 years i started eating it in hawaii and lived in korea for two years i ve had korean food in at least 3 countries i don t consider myself an expert but pretty well versed i love korea is very good i would like to eat there once or twice a week ,1
i understand that i love korea is owned by the same people that own korea house currently closed i love korea has very good sushi but the made to order meals are not as good to me as the buffet at korea house at the times i visited in 2013 the sushi is a good value but the lunch menu is a bit pricey for me especially if i order a side of sushi if i recall correctly lunch with a side order of sushi was around 16 and that is with a water tip not included i have been back and just had the sushi a couple of times and it is always sooo gooood and fresh ,1
traveling through huntsville my sister and decided to use tripadvisor for a korean rest we choose i love korea being there are three close to each other we ordered kimbop freshly rolled onion pancake huge bulgogi yakimondo can i say oh my goodness the portions were great for the price the rest is clean and spacious for large groups the food was made with love i am a lover of korean food due to a neighbor i had once was korean this food makes me miss my friend suk j if you eat here you will not be disappointed you will most likely have some food to take home and enjoy later i will pass through again and it will only be i korea ,1
i am always looking for good sushi i found this one by word of mouth and must say they know sushi the building used to be a japanese restaurant the outside although a bit rough opens up to a nice interior where you feel welcome there is a sushi bar at the front and we opted for that as i was a guest of another korean friend the selections were traditional but the presentation was spot on portions seemed larger than your typical restaurant and the chef was desirous to show us his work we had about 11 varieties each was well done i left full there is a mizo soup to start you off while you wait but the wait was not long at all staff was helpful and attentive i did not get to sample their other meal options but will be back to do so i can only give 4 stars till i try the rest dinner time is great time to go as there were open seats but over half full on the night we visited ,1
we ve eaten at three korean restaurants here in huntsville and by far this one was the best directly across the street from korea house another korean restaurant which we didn t really care for service was ok but food was not glad we came to i love korea ,1
first i certainly don t proclaim to be an expert on korean food my limited experience has been eating a friend s from south korea home cooked food which was excellent this food was decent but not as good as i ve had i thought the food was somewhat bland until i added a good amount of hot sauce very good waiter that was helpful in navigating the menu total bill for two meals 26 17 without the tip ,0
wow little hole in the wall with amazing food and super friendly service bulgogi and pajeon were as good as it gets and the kimchi beats anything i had in south korea ,1
this place as an amazing traditional bibimbap you can also ask the traditional bibimbap with tofu instead of meat if you are vegetarian beware of how spicy it is if you re not into spicy food though next time i will probably ask them to put a bit less but it s delicious anyway we also had the fried dumplings which were surprisingly tasty and the sauce was great order them and go eat there now i was there yesterday and i would honestly go again today ,1
i visit this restaurant regularly and they never disappoint the food is great the service is friendly and nice prices are standard i m a big fan of their bibimbap but the whole menu has its own merit recommend,1
the best korean restaurant in prague i like how all of the staff speak korean however the waiting time is too long much better for dinner than lunch ,0
went to bibimbap to try something different and it was a very nice experience the place was nice clean and cosy staff were very friendly and polite food had lots of flavor and portions were quite generous ,1
this little hole in the wall restaurant was around the corner from my bnb i was sick of all the meat in prague so opted to try some local ethnic korean cuisine this place did not disappoint food was spicy and delicious i recommend the dish 1 korean hot pot bibimbap on the menu but everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing if i get back to prague i will stop by again ,1
found this restaurant on tripadvisor and i was very optimistic sadly we ordered the salmon one of the most expensive things on the menu and when it came it hadn t been defrosted properly we also ordered the fried chicken and fried dumplings which were delicious and the black bean noodles which were below average overall the frozen salmon let the whole meal down but if that doesn t put you off i would definitely recommend the fried chicken and fried dumplings ,1
went there for dinner the staff was extremely friendly the food came with side dishes taste is very similar to what you can get in korea for a more than reasonable price highly recommended,1
we randomly stopped by during our stay and enjoyed the bibimbap and sweet and sour chicken soup that came with it was better than miso service was a bit slow but we managed i did appreciate that they offered tap water in a caraffe with several restaurants during our prague stay refused to offer ,1
look past the location and rough exterior as it is a very nice charming and cheap korean restaurant great value fantastic bibimbap tasted just like what i had in seoul ,1
me and my friends ate here a delicious korean meal we enjoyed it a lot and the prices were okay though not as low as other restaurants nearby 10 12 240 290 czk ,1
i ve been to this place many times alone and with family and friends this time i ordered kimchi chigae the soup didn t have a single decent piece of pork it used to have it was all bit and pieces one of the side dish had mayo which i couldn t eat common allergens ie eggs nuts are specified on menu which gimchi chigae has but not for the side dishes i couldn t change the dish if this had been told to me prior i would ask first whether i could change if not i d order something else i ended paying for something i couldn t eat also i ended up with gimbap without tuna despite ordering tuna gimbap on my first takeaway with the restaurant money wasted there the taste of the food is still good but other aspects has dropped quite a lot a bit here a bit there it s big when they are all accumulated ,0
we had a pleasant visit and meal at bibimbap food tasted amazing like my mother in law makes ofcourse some spiciness is lowered but it is completely not a minus kimchi was well aged and delicious was worth finding and visiting ,1
i often go to this place as it is just round the corner from my place it never disappoints the food is always good and just what i want the staff are always friendly,1
don t be fooled by the exterior of the building this place has really great food it s owned run by koreans and the bibimbap we ordered tasted just like the ones we ate in south korea lovely and polite staff highly recommended when you crave some delicious korean food ,1
the staff here is very nice and are more than willing to explain the dishes to those who are not familiar with korean cuisine most of the staff seemed to speak english so i would say they are also tourist friendly the place itself is nice enough some korean and korean themed decorations and the general atmosphere is calm and reserved pleasant for a peaceful and relaxing dinner the food is amazing it seems to be authentic and some dishes are very spicy hot but delicately seasoned the menu ranges from classic bibimbap and udon noodles to various gimgap and sweet potato noodles they also have some meals which can be shared with one or two other persons and they have sets so you can try various foods the price is fair for a dinner although i must say i wish they had a lunch menu too ,1
delicious asian food but you have to be careful with spicy dishes as they are really spicy good service ,1
stopped by here for our korean fix and were really happy bibimbap was delicious and service polite and fast the restaurant is nicely decorated despite being a basement style restaurant it didn t feel cramped at all busy but we didn t have any trouble turning up without a reservation after korean in prague check this place out ,1
the restaurant is literally a few meters away from the tram station but is not in plain view so you can easily miss it if you are not paying attention or if you don t know where to look the fact there are some stairs very near is also not helping however after you step in you realize that the inside is quite big and quite nice the setting is very pleasing and the decor is retaining the korean motives in clean modern lines we didn t know what to expect with respect to the food when we entered in and we can not certify if is authentic korean food what we can say that it tasted very good the service was also nice no personal touch but fast and professional we noticed near by a family with a small baby and they had a high chair overall a great find in prague we will probably return p s if is a weekend is better to make a reservation ,1
we visited this korean restaurant as per recommendation and noticing that it was very close to our accommodation we didn t book in advance as it was only a thursday evening but upon arrival we considered ourselves lucky as we managed to get one of the last tables there was a wide range of dishes on offer predominantly different variations of bibimbap dishes but many others too i ordered the bulgogi bibimbap number 2 on the menu and my boyfriend ordered the jeyuk bokeum bap number 8 both dishes were served with a side of kimchi and my bulgogi bibimbap also came with a clear soup both dishes were extremely tasty and my boyfriend even joked about asking for the recipe as it was that good and he wanted us to make it back at home the service was very prompt and the prices reasonably cheap we paid around 500kc with a tip from what i can remember would highly recommend ,1
prompt service good food in the center of prague if you like asian food you will probably enjoy this place ,1
the best korean restaurant in prague very authentic and super tasty if you like spicy do not wait a second longer ,1
i arrived after a morning of sight seeing they we re courteous and helpful i made mistakes with overpaying and they gave change back i mispronounced the order and they made sure it was i really wanted to order yummy food ,1
we went for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it we got the bibimbap a fried rice dish a trio of side dishes and 2 cokes for 20 the food was delicious and highly recommend it ,1
wasn t quite sure what to expect when i was walking in however the food was amazing if i dad a friend that was korean and they took me to their mums house i would expect it might be like this pure comfort food ,0
i mean the street is filled with plenty of better restaurants that are cheaper than this place the food isn t bad but it sure isn t authentic either my noodles were served with rice and the bibimbap reminded me more of a salad than a rice dish ,1
enjoyable experience we tried several korean dishes slightly higher waiting time because of prime hours but worthy ,1
we were craving korean food on our last night in prague and after a google search found this gem while it required me to take a 12 minute tram ride on the 15 or 26 it was worth the ride and nice to see a more neighborhood like part of prague compared to the flat i am staying in city center they accept visa and they do carry out i took our food to go and while i had to wait about 15 minutes for our food i imagine that had i called in my order it would have been ready when i got there in a city not known for strong customer service they accommodated my requests for sauce on the side for one dish and less spicy on my daughter s both the owner and the staff were kind patient and help the food tasted fresh and great and there was a lot of it we probably could have split a dish worth the trip ,1
so good they only have two types of dishes spicy and non spicy and if they say spicy they mean it the korean spicy red pesto is amazing and will make you sweat in the beginning and regret your choices at the end d in the best possible way my personal favourite is the meal no 3 the fried meat with rice and spicy korean pesto on the bed of lettuces so good coming back for it all the time D ,1
really good bibimbap it was a little bit too spicy for us but the beer saved our tongues staff was okay,1
we found this place online there was wide variety of food with quality loved that there was kimchi with every of our dishes it was very tasty i had the bibimbap and it was very overwhelming a lot of food you pay and get a really good sized portion the waitress was kind and helpful loved that there was kpop playing in the background very welcoming to any type of person ,1
we ordered 1 starter and main dish for two person all the food came the same time we ordered sweet and sour pork it was deep fried and not any mension in the menu we sayd it does not look the same in the list they did not care that at all can not recommend this place at all ,0
this is one of the best things about tripadvisor using the app can help you locate places you would ve never thought of trying out bibimbap has good service nice environment and great food there i tried korean food for the first time and i will definitely try it again to see if it is as good at bibimbap i had the no 1 on the menu which is said to be a traditional korean dish it was spicy and tasty for a very good price ,1
tasty spicy food good alternative for local czech restaurants well worth a visit inexpensive like every other restaurant in prague 3 ,1
the authentic bibimbap which is supposed to be served in a claypot and egg wasn t served instead we were being served something sort of a salad rice it is not like the one we have eaten back home we wish that this restaurant can serve true bibimbap as stated no matter the other food here are splendid ,1
do not recommend we ordered a vegetarian bibimbap they gave us 1st time a bibimbap with meat so we told the waitress and she said sorry sorry 2 min after we got another bibimbap expecting a vegetarian one this time after 2 or 3 layers we realized there was meat again inside this one so they probably used the 1st one to redo a vegetarian one very disappointed not recommend this place ,0
we both had the chicken bibimbap which was really tasty served with lots of leaves and generous portion of chicken the chicken was slightly dry but it is served with plenty of very spicy sauce which makes up for it also served with a small bowl of broth which was delicious the service was surprisingly good by prague standards and the serving staff were helpful in recommending a local bar nearby ,1
bibimbap korea is the best restaurant in prague for many reasons what i liked 1 the food is just so good and reasonably priced you get authentic korean food i was told by friends who lived in korea it s well prepared and presented 2 the service is very good i was impressed with the waitresses they are kind respectful speak english three characteristics that are hard to find in prague sorry to say that they don t have customer service skills here i was personally served by a blonde one i m sorry i don t know her name despite i ordered something but i meant something else she immediately went to the kitchen and got me what i wanted literally in 5 minutes thank you so much 3 restaurant is nice good atmosphere clean 4 owners are really nice i had the chance to have a chat with the owner a korean woman who is really nice 4 you can pay by card what i didn t like i actually never had any negative experience there i ve been three times so far ,1
we went out of our way to try this place and i m glad we did it s off the beaten path and by no means a fancy place so you can dress casual this is a value eat place really good food for a good price wouldn t recommend this place if you re not into korean food ,1
very good korean food best customer service i suggest to do reservation before you are coming here a lot of food spicy,1
a something different in a line of czech restaurants that i m really not a fan of cannot compare since this is a first korean place i visited but i left happy and full would recommend ,1
hello i just had dinner in this restaurant all was great till i found one hair in my food but the best part was when we paid and they charged me the dish where i found the hair which kind of restaurant is this one ,1
great korean food nice atmosphere and friendly staff members my husband and i were so happy that we went there so satisfying recommend to people who want to try real korean food with a reasonable price ,1
food is really really good portions are generous staff speaks english and are very nice and friendly recommended ,1
simple and centrally located place with good food and friendly staff english is not an issue and children are welcome,1
i have been to this restaurant 3 times both for lunch and dinner and i was always satisfied with the quality of food the owners are very polite and so do the waiters in the afternoon time there might be a longer waiting time ,1
as someone said for prague where the food is quite mediocre this place gets a four while in la it will probably get a three the fact that the owners are korean does not make the place korean the food was ok warm and generous but it was not bibimbap korean we ate the service was ok place looked ok clean though you step out smelling like the cook as i said being that you are in prague this place is a good place to eat ,0
this restaurant was our biggest surprise nice was super nice the place is cozy and the food amazing that brought back all of our memories from seoul i was super happy because they are making hotteok as well what is a little bit pricey compared to seoul but the taste just worth is plus if you are vegetarian you can ask any food without meet ,1
dont be fooled by the look we thought it was closed but once you enter you wont regret it the food is fantastic real authentic korean affordable and worth a visit will definetly come back if we re ever in prague again ,1
i ve been coming back to bibimbap semi regularly for a while their prices have gone up a little bit but are still lower than in other korean restaurants in prague the place has become very popular particularly at dinner time so make sure to book a table the food is delicious the service is great vegetarian options are available awesome place ,1
great authentic bibimbap in prague so glad we found this place as we needed a change from the european food very cheap too we were staying in old town so it was a 30 min walk probably the only downside to this restaurant ,1
the food was super nice and the staff was very helpful the portions are very big and only 170 240 crowns 6 5 to 10 they have several tables in different little rooms so it feels very intimate i loved it totally worth it ,1
i came here to eat after a quick look on here there was a 30 minute wait but the place was packed and there were others waiting so i knew it must be good koreans and locals ate here too my meal was very delicious and what i guess home cooked korean food would taste like it is very advisable to book a table ahead of visiting,1
we were incredibly lucky to have this by our apartment fully recommend you check this place out check out the photo service amazing food next level so cheap too short and sweet review we both left extremely happy big tip left ,1
we found this place with trip advisor and it was amazing the dishes were great i loved the beef and the people were so heart warming it was a wonderful evening ,1
the food is amazing makes you feel at soul _ and the owners are very nice and helpful as well as the staff highly recommended good food great service nice atmosphere _ ,1
if you re a korean kitchen lover or just willing to taste it you should visit this restaurant the food is very tasty but if you don t like spicy food pay attention to the menu cuz there s a lot of spicy dishes also the dishes are big and the price isn t so expensive if you re a spicy lover i recommend to try the dish named kimchi chigae ,1
exellent food big portions and good service would come here again entrance door is not on the main street so look for the stairs to go down one level ,1
the food was excellent and the portions were large the prices were low the service was not top notch but i did not mind the food and the prices were so great ,1
fantastic food lovely service very well priced highly recommend if you are in the area and are looking for a filling meal the seafood broth with noodles is amazing ,1
great atmosphere tasty food and perfect location that is bibimbap place where you gonna feel like you are somewhere in asia great experience ,1
pretty nice food i got one of those boxes with several different dishes inside and absolutely enjoyed it ,1
not a frequent korean eater so not much reference material but this was excellent food for a great price ,1
everything you want of korean food is here lots of choices and prices are affordable good place for lunch ,1
just had an incredible bibimbap and a soup for starter reasonably spicy and very authentic the broth only is worth dying for very friendly staff go there try it ,1
very solid korean food super friendly staff unassuming atmosphere only problem is the rather long wait for the food to arrive highly recommended nonetheless ,1
good place cheap and tasty food been there 2 times so good for that cash advise this restaurant ,1
down to earth ambience very friendly staff not that i m an expert on korean cuisine but i ve eaten bibimbap at least 10 times and also in some famous korean restaurants abroad and the food quality here is comparable and better than in most prague restaurants recommended ,1
a variety of korean kitchen excellent tasty food accessible by tram packed with locals inexpensive ,1
it was the first time we tried a korean restaurant and it was an excellent experience good and fast service friendly staff and exquisite food portions were big and the price was also really nice ,1
we ate there great korean dishes servings were big it was my first time with this type of cuisine and i m positively suprised although the place smells a little bit odd i think that the reason is bad air conditioning or lack of ventilation ,0
one of my favourite restaurants in prague all their dishes are amazing the classical bibimbap is just mindblowing and so tasty very good prices as well ,1
we came here based on the good reviews and were not disappointed they do put a good deal of sririacha on a couple of the dishes so if you don t like that sauce you might mention to hold that good ground beef with kimchi ,1
food 3 service 1 very slow service when i came in service were sitting with ice cream they didn t care about customers at all,0
i used to travel a lot to korea in the past so i miss korean food now this restaurant a nice place with excellent couisine and extremely kind service brought my memory back to the old days of my travelling to this country so everything really really nice ,1
i d never eaten in a korean restaurant before and if other are to this standard then i will be doing so a lot more often it is a little tricky to find from the main road and you will need to book ahead of time but what a great experience,1
if you want to taste something different than avarage asian food available on every czech street you should definately go there it is the unique place in prague with delicious cuisine not only for asian food lovers but also for those who want to taste something new classic bibimbap bulgogi bap and udong are great they used to have ramen not sure if still available the must visit spot on zizkov ,1
great authentic korean dishes although the food took extremely long to be prepared we had a great meal and the prices are cheap highly recommend the fried chicken as the proportion was big and very delicious ,1
i rarely give 5 stars on tripadvisor but this place deserves it the food is really good the restaurant itself is simple but comfy and the waitresses are making sure that you re comfortable and well served it was one my first times eating korean but i really liked their main dish with a side of fish soup bill for the main course and a beer 220 czk will definitely go back ,1
as soon as i arrived to prague went to tripadvisor to have a look what was being offered as a cheap eats and surprisingly i found this restaurant on this category which made me go for it without even seeing the following options as i love korean food the bibimbap and the 2 soups were simply excelent ,1
let me start of with that i eat authentic asian food at home everyday and that i am quite picky i travel quite a bit and it s hard to find this good authentic korean food in europe the noodle soup starters and seafood pancake haemul pajeon was extremely good we ended up ordering more than we could eat just because it was good and we left very satisfied and i wish my wife would have allowed me to tip even more than i did thank you for a great meal ,1
as a native korean on a visit this hit the spot prices are excellent but more importantly the food was just like how mom makes it soon dubu kimchi jjigae bulgogi and bibimbap were all good plus the kimchi was nice and spicy you will find this restaurant on an awkward corner of a block in prague 3 about a 10 minute uber ride or 40 minute walk from prague 1 after eating goulash for a couple days our group craved some spices thanks bibimbap korea ,1
my standards are very high when it comes to korean food my aunt chong s family in seoul owns one of the most successful korean restaurants and my aunt can cook i am very spoiled on korean food as i grew up eating it i have tried korean food all over europe but this place beats them hands down there is a fantastic korean place in dresden that is impressive and they do things the old school way cook your own meat on the center of the table if you desire however if you are wishing to have excellent korean food in prague this is hands down the absolute very best sample everything you can as you will not go wrong ,1
 the food is delicious kind and polite waitress small place with a lot of table but it is enjoyable when it is not full recommended to make a reservation,1
we decided to check this place out having seen all the amazing reviews on tripadvisor and we were certainly not disappointed the restaurant is a little out of the way but worth the way it is just off of the street you get off the tram and down some steps inside is nothing special but the service is great and friendly and it was reasonably quiet the night we went we hadn t eaten korean before so didn t know what to expect we tried korean ginger tea which was delicious and then my partner had the tradition soup to start followed by a tray of pork and rice etc it looked amazing i had a ramen type bowl and some sushi which were both great and plentiful the price is amazing and the food is a of a high standard thoroughly enjoyed it ,1
we found this restaurant on trip advisor while searching for some new place to go for a dinner the good reviews do not lie food is very delicious and you will have problems to finish it as the amount is pretty generous worth to try out ,1
we love to visit this place easily accessible from the centre and delicious bibimbap leaves without regrets great beer and rice wine too ,1
i brought here many friends and everyone loved it it s owned by an older korean couple who is usually at the spot helping their staff tried a few of their meals but every time i get back to bibimbap the classic although they increased prices recently it s still good value for money i recommend to book a table a day in advance in the evenings it s almost impossible to find a free table prior booking the amount of korean people there also confirm its authenticity ,1
i was never a big fan of korean cusine but bibimbap made a differance to my taste i even visited the place twice in three days size of the portion is just perfect and the used ingridents were just right proces are so resonable the speciality dish was bibimbab ,1
saturday evening and we had no reservation but still tried our luck we had to share out table but it was no problem food was really good and it came quickly prices are very affordable strong recommendation ,1
i had planned to visit bibimbap based on the positive reviews and was not disappointed visited last monday feb 13th arrived at 2pm without booking and found a table very good fresh food cooked served well judging by the amount of korean asian customers on the day we visited i feel it must me authentic i had the seafood noodles and was not disappointed my friend had the spicy work and wanted to order some for take away as well if you are in prague and want something different this must be on your list ,1
fantastic place to eat our korean dishes they offer various kinds of the stuff that is both very tasty and also looks great definitely recommended ,1
my favorite korean place in prague the food is good it s not too far from the centrum and the prices are average i ve been going here since they were still a smaller shop in karlin and their menu has expanded since but still delicious generally i go for the kimchi fried rice or the spicy pork when i m alone but the seafood pancake and the chicken kkanpunggi is really good to share the owners are also really friendly ,1
i wouldn t say the bibimbap was the most authentic ones we had tried before but overall the food was actually quite delicious we went for dinner without reservation and didn t have to wait long for a table despite the place was quite packed service was good and the price was reasonable ,1
visitors with friend saw many koreans coming for dinner that was a good sign food was perfect and prices very friendly ,1
not everything mix with korean spicy sauce is bibimbap rice meat mix with raw vegetables salad i wonder if the owner or the chef ever tried or seen korean bibimbap or not lol okay restaurant environment was nice service okay at least already better than other restaurants can t expect much of prague service ,0
i we have visited the place twice in the past month one was a quick lunch the place does not offer any special lunch menu and the other was what was to be a decent birthday celebration food is great in terms of its variety authenticity and freshness other reviews testify to this show you pics etc so no need to delve in detail on this the service is however problematic the lunch experience was below average service wise in terms of attentiveness etc but since the place was pretty empty it was bearable however the birthday celebration on friday night occassion with a place having being completely packed revealed and amplified this general problem the staff was very nervous as a line of guests waited inside and outside the restaurant demanding to be seated afyer being seated i had to leave the table three times first to ask for the menu card after 20 minutes waiting and not seeing anyone to come and say even hello second to ask where our soup was after another 30 mins of nothing happening after i brought a waiter with me to the table and third the same with our main course somehow not making it to our table again after 30mins with soup balls still on table next tables were not served any better but the international crowd of youngsters seemed to be patient if dissatisfied too additionally the right side of the restaurant was very cold and we kept our winter jacket on at times bottom line i will give it a third chance as we live nearby but if the service is not substantially improved i will go elsewhere then there is another jap korean restaurant nearby wont identify not to be blamed for favouring it which albeit more expensive provides top service ,0
great authentic food for reasonable price very nice and efficient service which speaks english free wifi ,1
i had a fantastic experience here though i d recommend booking in advance we had to wait for a table for three but nothing extreme only 20mins or so the menu has pictures if you re unsure of what to order and the food was delicious would highly recommend and would definitely visit again ,1
bibimbap korea is valuable korean restaurant in europe it serves original korean food and it is really amazing that i can eat real korean food here it is definitely different from other korean restaurant in other european countries i study in netherlands and i tried many already in other already but they are frequently poor however this place use fresh ingredients and think much about the food some of food was much better than korea if you are beginner of korean food try kimchi bok eum bap or bibimbap or dosirak menu i think cham ppong is one of the best dish here but it will be too spicy for beginner anyway i think most of the dishes here deserves the price you can see many foreigners and local people who is eating korean food when i visited here more than 90 were non korean and 70 were non asian if you have enough budget try this restaurant you won t regret oh and the servers can speak not only english but also korean quite well you can see servers are talking with korean owner in korean language it is also interesting experience ,1
friendly service great food and nice interior good food in big portions always recommended central location near city centre ,1
my boyfriend and i went to this restaurant twice when we were in prague both the food and the staffs are excellent the two owners are also really nice and helpful the first time we had fried pork with sweet sour sauce and chicken bibimbap and the second time we had bulgogi bibimbap with braised chicken with potato and carrot the restaurant is always full and it s quite small so make a reservation before you come ,1
with my boyfriend who is quite acquainted with korean cuisine we decided to give this place a try we ordered bibimbap and sundubu ƒçigae and weren t disappointed at all the food was delicious the service friendly and really helpful it was nice as well that we could get some free tap water with our meal not that common in cz or at least with a lot of troubles korean people at the next tables were also a good sign recommend to everyone who likes this cuisine ,1
the food was delicious and the service was wonderful even if you dont eat it all you can take it home and eat it later it was a wonderful time ,1
the food in this place was incredible i have to say i can t remember exactly what we ate my partner had a nice chicken dish with korean sauce i had a platter box with pork and squid lots of other delicious things it was healthy but so tasty i would go back to prague just to visit this place probably the best meal i have ever had i will ask my partner what it was see if she remembers sake was nice too and for pudding we had the most beautiful small sweet pancake to share presentation to die for great thank you for the impeccable service relaxed and informal but spot on ,1
i am visiting this restaurant from the times it was placed in another address i don t know what to order in this place because i want eat everything ,1
went for saturday lunch really good food great english speaking service and reasonable prices will be coming back ,1
great small place with great food the place itself looks a bit dull but the food more than compensates for the humble surroundings ,1
we decided to visit this place cuz we like korean food this place is absolutely dull walls are white and empty light is very cold in whole restaurant and because of that u feel like in hospital they haven t got cloths hanger that s little bit uncomfortable we took ramen and bibimbap a with set of suchi ramen was big and very very hot noodles in it were very simple and without any special taste looked like the cheapest fast food noodles but it was spicy thanks for that bibimbap wasn t tasty at all we both didn t like it sushi were without any meet or fish just vegetable sushi but that were big and tasty very simple atmosphere 3 from 10 food 3 from 10 service 7 from 10,0
love their food so much every time we get a take out or a sit down it s the same great quality and the staff are super ,1
completely unexpected if you are looking for an authentic experience then look no further the prices are relatively low as well ,1
having lived in korea for over two years and being with a korean we were excited but a bit skeptical to find some korean food next to our place we went for lunch and ordered bibimbap pajeon and bulgogi kimbap the restaurant s signature dish was delicious on par with what you d find in korea flavorful authentic and chocked full of various fresh veggies we also appreciated that it wasn t served too hot our pajeon was solid nice and crispy on the outside and soft inside with delicious bits of green onion and squid the kimbap a staple of my diet when i lived in seoul was a bit of a letdown a tad bland and dry you can see why they didn t name the place kimbap the meal wasn t cheap but not prohibitively expensive either though i m used to paying less for similar dishes the biggest negative of the meal was the lack of side dishes as well as bland kimchi that seemed washed in attempt to downplay its natural spiciness for the european market i d definitely recommend but stick to the bibimbap ,1
probably the best korean you ll find in prague this place is very cheap for the quality of the food i d reccomend booking in advance if you plan on going on a friday or saturday night it gets very busy the menu is extensive and there is definitely something for everyone vegetarian options in abundance we had the beef and some fried chicken thing portions are massive after getting 3 dishes and 1 soup we couldn t finish it all would highly reccomend this place perfect for a good quality cheap eat ,1
very fresh healthy and tasty meals definitely a go go just be careful if you do not like it too spicy ,1
came here with some friends the services were great the food was really delicious however the time waiting for the meal to come up is really slow around 30min i would not recommed this to anyone with the rush of time ,1
we ve been going to this restaurant since it was located in karl√≠n we are always touched to see the amazing job the owners have done during the past years their restaurant is growing and it s not only because of the excellent food it s the welcoming atmosphere there is one disadvantage for us we can t go there for dinner whenever we want anymore reservations have become needed i am sure the owners will keep the good job for a very long time and we are happy for them 3,0
this is the place to get the bibimbap in prague absolutely delicious with strong broth and fabulous kimchi don t even think about the other places offering the korean cuisine this is an absolute gem ,1
we went after reading the reviews and it didn t disappoint the waitress was supernice and to our surprise the quality was higher than what you expect for a 150ck plate beware of the spicyness definitely recommend we ll be going quite often ,1
got recommended this restaurant and was certainly not dissapointed no nonsense restaurant great tasty korean food the number of etnic korean customers was an extra assurance to us that this was a good choice rather plain decor thus maybe not the setting for the perfect romantic date but rather for casual lunch or dinner with friends or family or just by yourself fast service ,1
really tasty food and great service highly recommend had fried chicken sweet and spicy sauce to share as well as several sides ,1
i visited this restaurant with my dad both of us having on different occasions visited korea and loved the food and we were not disappointed the food was great and authentic the atmosphere is ok and the gentleman who served us the owner their waitress was off at the time was lovely and helpful the menu is limited but that s no fault it means that what you get is really fresh and delicious based on this i d rate it five star however just as most if not all korean or perhaps asian in general restaurants in prague the food contains msg and possibly quite considerable amounts if i had any suspicions they were confirmed by the sight of the familiar long crystals in the chilli powder mix that i was offered when asked for extra chillies i was disappointed by this and not surprised msg really is very common in countries like korea and it is almost impossible to get away from there so it s understandable you d find it here my guess is you d struggle to find korean restaurant in prague that avoids msg and this one is probably as good as it gets one recommendation to the restaurant get some fresh chillies or korean chilli sauces to offer those customers who want the real spicy deal ,1
i love this restaurant i just to live in seoul and you won t find any other place in prague that even comes close to the same the owner is a wonderful man originally from seoul so he knows what he is doing the staff is just lovely i would recommend this restaurant for any occasion ,1
we walked from old town prague to bibimbop korea didn t expect the walk to be so far but we were very pleased to have found the place and even happier when the busy restaurant was able to find a table for the 4 of us this restaurant was busy and booked full with reservations after having dined here i understand why the food is amazingly delicious service is prompt and attentive the staff there are polite and welcoming the food was served quickly and it was savored by all of us in our group wonderfully seasoned all the foods were the perfect temperature and plenty of drinks to go around the host was friendly and checked in on us during dinner a couple of times to be sure we had everything we needed wonderful service this place is the best korean food in prague definitely worth the walk or if you re hungry take a taxi but definitely don t miss out this place is the place to go and be sure to make a reservation ,1
decided to check this place out after reading the four star reviews on trip advisor they were correct excellent fresh food served with a big fat smile the only thing is it was hard to get a table but i think that was my fault as i told the group of people i was with 60ish and they got there before me and stole my restaurant ,1
4 days in prague and we visited this korean restaurant twice more if we had had the chance the food was exquisite kimchi jjigae chicken for 2 the pancake the bibimbap the service was not very fast but the owner is a very gentle man for dinner the restaurant gets croweded easily probably because it is the best in town but it is well worth the wait they would rather make you wait rather than make you sit next to strangers so for me it is a plus i more than recommended this place and wish they would move from prague to paris where i live ,1
absolutely delicious very tasty heart warming food and very friendly staff one of my favorite stops on my way home from work ,1
the food was delicious and the staff very friendly and helpful prices are very good for prague meals were prepared fast and fresh i had jaeyook and i was more than satisfied they even played k pop in the restaurant so the atmosphere was very pleasant there if i lived in prague i d go there very often ,1
very nice clean and welcoming good food well cooked very cheap meal for 2 with drinks less than 15 well worth a visit ,1
i had the traditional korean dish that s on the front of the menu just the right amount of spice staff was very friendly and happy to help they even told me the correct way to eat the dish try it ,1
we had a great time in the restaurant the food was very good and the waiter was incredibly cute and nice we absolutely recommend this place,1

food is very good staff is very nice and friendly everyone speaks english they have a korean wine that is part of the experience ,1
it was a fantastic experience and i just loved it small place clean and cosy place feel like you have lunch with family very polite personnel and the food just come and taste it you will enjoy every bite ,1
i went to bibimbap with my girlfriend and we both enjoyed the evening very much all waiters were very polite and genuinly nice i ordered the speciality bibimbap for affordable 150 czk i was very positively surprised that it included kimchi and a broth all very tasty though i asked for vege version of bibimbap i doubt the broth they brought me was vegetarian so i recommend to ask them about that if you re vegetaratian vegan the beer was also good and for a reasonable price all in all it was a very pleasent experience for good money ,1
we love this restaurant for occasional visit menu is not so big but the bibimbap is very tasty you get side of kimchi and soup owners are korean and staff is nice and helpfull prices are more than reasonable 150kc for bibimbap portions generous you will leave satisfied although spiciness level is probably tailored for locals as it is not that spicy at every visit we saw couple of koreans which i thing is sign that the place is good and somewhat authentic given the price and location ,1
really tasty food which is well priced nothing fancy just good honest cooking the owners seen to be a couple wife cooking husband out front he is very welcoming and a big reason we keep going back ,1
really great wholesome food just be aware that the spicy really is spicy i would most definitely recommend this place ,1
i really missed korean food after moving back from melbs to east central europe maybe reading all the excited reviews raised my expectations too high but what i found in bibimbap was a nice and rather busy low key and cosy restaurant with friendly staff and almost home like atmosphere but the choice of dishes was rather limited and food was a bit bland all in all this seems to be a nice and friendly place to go to with friends but do not expect really real korean ,1
today we tried for the first time real korean food at bibimbap korea the restaurant was not the easiest to find as it is a 5 min walk from zizkov tower hidden after a staircase and not so easy to spot we luckily used this map and eventually found it we ordered plum tea lemon tea common bibimbap and gimbap the flavor were new to us but very fresh and tasty plus presentation was very good as you could see they put passion in their dishes service was also attentive and staff was helpful i was also served fermented kimchi to taste but that was too extreme to me and i did not like it but every othet dish was amazing totally recommend ,1
first of all let me say this is not the most authentic korean food i have ever eaten but still the food was excellent the menu though was disappointingly small me and my boyfriend got rolls to share and mains everything was top quality and tasted amazing portions are big enough and we even left food on our plates which we rarely do great value for money the only thing i felt really bad about was that i left the wrong tips which was almost nothing other than that i would revisit definitely ,0
i had bogogi bibimbap and beer have to say i m quite disappointed according to the reviews i was expecting authentic korean food however my bibimbap has lots of arugula and lettuce this is salad with minced beef on top of the rice not authentic not even spicy ,0

while the food quality was good the service was terrible we waited over an hour for our food and although the manager apologized for the delay that he blamed on a full house i was quite annoyed that a couple seated more than fifteen minutes after us were served their meal which did not seem any less complicated than ours before us so if you don t mind the wait go ,1
i went there because i stayed in a nearby hotel i took the classic bibimbap menu and really enjoyed it the food quality was very good the staff was very friendly the price is very good in relation to the quality of the food it s not in the usual tourist location but nearby a tram stop it s certainly worth to take the short trip to go there ,1
great food friendly staff options for vegetarians as i am reasonably priced it s worth a visit if your in the area ,1
classic korean food for a really good price really delicious korean dishes the atmosphere was really good and the staff was really friendly i would definitely come and eat here again ,1
we went here on our last day of our trip we chose this place after seeing other reviews on tripadvisor and also since korean food is not usually easily available in europe we were not disappointed since we don t eat meat we asked the waitress to make a vegetarian bibimbap with eggs and veggies and use tofu instead of beef she gladly took our order also our order came with some kind of soup which was also nice and the kimchi was just like i was expecting i also took the ginger tea which i also liked was sweet but i think it might not be for everyone ,1
this is one of the more authentic korean restaurants i have been to outside of korea we ate here twice during our visit the quality of the ingredients is high everything is cooked fresh and the prices are unbeatable i highly recommend this restuarant to anyone who loves korean food the waitresses are not korean but it appears that the owner and the cook both are and there are always lots of korean people eating there we may go back for a third visit tonight ,1
the food was amazing and authentic at a really good price good service as well came here twice during my 3 day stay in prague ,1
literally bibimbab korea is the most authentic korean restaurant in prague i can taste real korean food in europe price is reasonable and the service was amazing i was full of surprised that the waitress can speak fluent korean and the best part is owner you can get the best korean cuisine in best price ,1
this is my go to korean restaurant in prague everything here is perfect the owner and staff are some of the kindest i ve encountered i ve been here over 10 times and the service is always perfect the food is truly authentic korean and the prices are pretty good as well ,1
found this korean restaurant by accident one day while randomly walking through a neighborhood in prague after living in korea for three years i have become a bit obsessed about authentic korean food i was not disappointed it was delicious and the service was great i would definitely go back ,1
we ordered 1 bulgogi bap 2 korean seafood pancake 3 gimbap 4 ramyeon 5 fried chicken 6 kimchi soup we love it all it s just too delicious the waitress non korean wasnt very friendly but the owner korean is very nice i would definitely recommend this if you are looking for asian taste in prague it is one if the best meal we ve ever had in eastern europe ,1
not expecting to find korean food in prague but this place is excellent tram 5 and 9 goes past it get down at lipanska stop cross the road and go down the stairs bibimbap was super good value pretty satisfying very happy to recommend this place for a good meal ,1
helpful staff low prices delicious food there is no reason why not to come if you like korean this is the place to be ,1
i just moved in the area close to this restaurant and after going there just by chance it has became my fav place for dinner on lazy evening food quality is very high and service is great always smiling and very polite my favorite dish is bibimbap but whatever i try new i enjoy ,1
the place was clean authentic and tasty also the service was very responsive and polite i am definitely coming back very recommendable for asian cuisine ,1
the restaurant is right at the lipanska tram stop bibimbap was good and tasty so was the kimchi soup with pork service was nice and friendly great korean food away from korea ,1
we made reservations for dinner we re glad we did as this little neighborhood korean restaurant is popular and for good reason the service is excellent english speaking servers helped a great deal in this regard the menu is descriptive with english listings the food is wonderfully fresh and artistically presented we plan to return and we recommend that you go for it too ,1
the menu was a tad too long but the presentation was very good the owner met us personally and the staff was really helpful and efficient i can t say it is authentic korean cuisine but they have tried very hard at maintaining authenticity while wooing the locals i think they couldn t do more very pleasurable experience would definitely visit again ,1
i love bibimbap i love this restaurant best place evr enjoy this place when i am in prague i must visit and eating in this restaurant ,1
my friend and i wanted a hot meal after a long day of tourism in prague and bibimbap couldn t have been better we ordered an udong and a kimchi jigae and they were both amazingly delicious the banchan was also really nice and the service was also nice the owner was there and greeted us also the price was absolutely great ,1
we spent last 18 months traveling around we were always looking for korean bistro to fulfill our desire for our favourite bibimbap this actually never happened because the best and only real bibimbap for us is the one that mr mrs lee are serving in their restaurant there is no better korean restaurant in english and spanish speaking world their recipes for kimchi and tuna soup are just perfect soup is so strong and tasty it is a cure for any weakness we went there yesterday after all those months new place in zizkov looks beautiful servers are super friendly and happy as always and the food the food was maybe even better then i remember my favourite combo is bibimbap in non heated bowl mr lee s classic it is not korean traditional but the rice stays soft all the time and not ower dry from warmth of the bowl soup and kimchi comes with the meal total price of czk150 is cheap for what you get and really good price point so everyone can afford this experience tuna sushi to share czk130 for 14pcs maxi roll yummy i just love this place must visit in prague for sure ,1
no fuss or gimmick in the restaurant style but when the food came it was beautiful in looks and the taste was fantastic the potion size was great not too big and definitely not small kimichi rice was excellent and the classic bimbimbap with salad was super we went at lunch and it was not overly busy highly recommended look forward to the next visit to try something else ,1
this restaurant used to be near my office and we went there almost every week thanks to bibimbap korea i was introduced to korean food and it was love at first sight i am very happy that even though they ve moved from near my office now they are near my home and we go almost every week for dinner delicious food esp bibimbap and really nice service for a very reasonable price the average item on the menu costs around 150 160 crowns i couldn t recommend this restaurant more ,1
so glad we found this restaurant via tripadvisor the food was amazing the portions were huge and i d recommend trying the delicious classical bibimbap the first dish on the menu we felt so welcomed by the friendly staff and owners we returned for dinner on the same day this was one of the highlights of our dining experience in prague and we ll definitely come back during our next trip ,1
small bistro with homemade korean food and homemade feel no design please great place to discover the cuisine for very reasonable price bonus the owner is very nice gentleman ready to share advice on your next trip to korea concentrate on food not on the appearance ,1
a very nice suprice for a fraction of money you would spend in restaurants in direct city center we recived hudge portions of dishes so tastefull that we just could not stop eating even we were full after half of the dish a must see place if you are in zizkov ,1
this is a gem you really won t want to miss especially worth mentioning is the bulgogi bibimbap second option on the menu right past the nomen omen dish bibimbap the ambience is cozy sweet very familiar what a nice find in prague ,1
nice people very good and healthy food i m surprised by the quality the price is unbeatable in that sense second time i come and will do again,1
outstanding korean food love that they have a variaty of different bibimbap instead of just the normal btw the normal bimbimbap is served like the dolsot bibimbap in hot stone bowl i had the one with pork meat and it was great lovely spicy taste prices are absolutely fine and definitely worth the money seems like they have lunch offers aswell female waitress even spoke korean ,1
i ve been to a couple of korean places around prague but this one is my favourite the menu is quite simple but the bibimbap is delicious and they have a selection of kimbap as well to help my frequent kimbap cravings what i love is that their bibimbap comes with such good and plentiful veggies that it s more or less a healthy dinner in my possibly not especially objective opinion the owner is super sweet and talkative and is clearly very proud of his little establishment ,1
we stopped by for lunch after reading the previous reviews and weren t disappointed both of our dishes were fantastic we can recommend the bibimbap number 1 one of the best we ve had authentic and tasty and all for a reasonable price it s quite nice to dine in exactly as pictured and there s wifi the owner and all the staff were friendly and welcoming definitely recommend if you re in the area ,1
this place is a must try the food is wonderful the staff is smiling and great i had a sundubu jjigae and i enjoyed it greatly it was my first korean food experience in prague and i have no regret ,1
excellent taste especially to korean tourists who look for real korean foods the bibimbab that the restaurant serves is the best one that i have ever eaten outside korea ,1
one of the best korean restaurants ive ever been yet very cheap try the kimchi if you like traditional korean dishes the owner is a nice guy smiling all time ,1
nase nejoblibenejsi restaurace se skvelou obsluhou a vybornym jidlem the best korean food and service in prague ,1
great korean cuisine very friendly staff and reasonable prices i m coming back to eat through the whole menu ,1
we were very surprised to find a korean restaurant in prague and especially one this good the service is very friendly and the food is great the best thing we had was the kimpap or gimbap we have had this many times before and i think this was my favourite one we also had the ramyeon which was really good for a cold night and bibimbap in a stone bowl was nice but could do with some more vegetables it s very reasonable priced to eat here so order a bottle of soju and enjoy ,1
we visited this restaurant because of the recommendation of one of my friend the owner of the restaurant was very helpful as it was our first visit of the korean restaurant we also took the rice wine which was bit unusual but great if you want to try something new come here ,1
i went here with my friend it was difficult to find a food that is not spicy my kimƒçi pokum bap was basically rice with red curry paste and fried bits of carrot and yammi egg on the top it was really cold cleaning spicy food and i enjoyed it a lot yellow tea i took it without honey sugar and it was not my favourite kind of tea it tastes as burnt rice it wasn t my favourite taste but i drank it and felt good afterwards it was a lovely experience to taste the spicy food with refreshing rather sour salad the price was great for the food we got our budget was to stay under 200 czk for one meal and one drink per person and we did manage without problems the atmosphere was simple it s not a place where i would go for interior design but food was my goal this time and it exceeded expectations the serves was really friendly and explained all tastes and combinations i really appreciated it i will come back again ,1
delicious hearty meal with genuinely friendly and caring service the only downside is the waiting time about 45 minutes for two mains but the freshness of the food is certainly worth the wait ,1
my girlfriend and i were craving some korean food and this really hit the spot it s very difficult to find decent authentic korean food in europe so this was a really lucky find food is good service is friendly and prices are reasonable don t miss out ,1
its a new resturant that opend 4 days before we arrive the manger and his wife were so nice and the food was amazing prices were good its first time i ate korean food and i felt like im in a dream im speechless,1
we visited in an early january lunch time only the two of us and a student in another table all the food were very mediocre when we started to think the pork bibimbap was quite good the rice was piping hot but when we put the pork in the mouth they were fridge cold so just ate the rice without the pork when we mentioned it after paying the server said the pork was precooked and stored in the fridge they forgot to warm it up before putting them on the rice ,1
free byo but have a couple of beers available food was a really interesting range of flavours many familiar some not decent portions well presented felt slightly expensive for more of a cafe than a restaurant but was happy with value at the end of the day ,1
i m quite confused about how this places gets good reviews for a plate of vegetable dumplings fried squid that was thin and covered in panko and oily and a plain plate of beef short rib 15 bulgogi without rice or anything we paid 33 what the actual help the portions were tiny too we were given tap water in a re usable pink plastic water bottle you use to take water on your bicycle and then at the end of the meal 2 slices of orange on a plate by far the most bizarre and most expensive meal we have had which was not worth even 5 to make we felt this was some kind of joke still can t quite believe it both of us a size 10 we went for food afterwards unbelievable ,0
my friends an i have thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at seoul gaja formerly known as dain korea pancakes squid bibimpap so good great taste kind of spicy but not too much i ve only tried seafood but i m looking forward to going back and try other stuff the service is fast of polite definitely cheap considering the quality of the food highly recommended ,1
the setting is quite basic and if you want a fancy setting then it would be better to go somewhere else the focus is all on the food here which was amazing i loved the plain setting it added to the ambiance and authenticity of the food which was delicious you can see part way into the kitchen and there s an honesty about that too the portions were generous and the service was excellent i can see why it is such a favourite you can have a super meal here at a very reasonable price especially if you bring your own drinks ,1
the menu includes a large variety of different korean dishes portions are big and food is tasty we were given a free starter of salad kimchi and radish cash only staff were friendly note the name has changed to seoul gaja ,1
lovely delicious food and service think it s change it s name now to seol but same establishment korean spicy chicken especially tasty atmosphere could do with attention though as a bit too basic ,1
a group of us ate here last month the group consisted of vegetarians meat eaters and myself who at the time was followed a vegan diet everyone of us was pleased with the dishes we chose and the complimentary kimchi and salads i am looking forward to returning again ,1
some of the best food i ve had in months looks completely forgettable from the outside but as soon as you step inside you ll know it s something special incredibly attentive waiting staff cheap yet plentiful portions of incredible food booking essential on weekends ,1
always very welcoming wide selection of typical korean dishes extra sauce provided if you want it hotter we had noodles rice dishes and fish prawns all very tasty with complimentary salads and raw pickles very very tasty especially chicken and vegetarian dumplings well worth a visit to this friendly korean restaurant with delicious ginger tea ,1
we booked out the whole restaurant for a group of about 30 people and everybody had a wonderful time the food was great really flavourful and tasty and the service was excellent too i was so impressed with the speed at which they brought out 30 orders and made no mistakes at all because i think that many people can be quite tricky to manage all in all it was a wonderful meal ,1
incredible food me and my friend ordered the 26 set menu thinking it would be just enough for the two of us and it was so much food amazing value for money and brilliant quality which is rare in this day and age the staff were friendly and efficient and the service was very quick a quirky and delicious little spot for all occasions 10 10 ,1
i heard great things about this restaurant from a korean friend they weren t wrong myself and 15 friends had dinner here for my birthday the setting itself is average but the smells coming from the kitchen enhance the atmosphere tenfold each person ordered a few different dishes the tables were full to the brim i can honestly say that every single dish was incredible the menu is full of choice i d recommend trying a few different things and sharing the only thing that let this experience down was the service there was one waitress working and found it difficult to accommodate the 16 of us ordering took a really long time as she had trouble understanding what we wanted the menu is numbered so we thought it would be simple enough but she said she didn t know what each number was subsequently she then wrote down a few of our orders incorrectly but hey the food completely overshadowed that one small issue will be returning frequently ,1
went for lunch today and really enjoyed it food was authentic and very tasty will definitely return to try more from the menu ,1
the food and the service are overall good but i was not really impressed it was my first time in a korean restaurant so i might need to increase the sample i would try it again ,1
still the best bipimbap i ve had in bristol great little place on my first visit they even gave helpful instructions on how to eat this korean delight mix it all together and tuck right in ,1
have had dinner here quite a few times each time ordering korean dishes and a few sushi dishes all food super tasty and authentic,1
excellent food the noodles are amazing all good was great perfect with family and they were helpful with our young child super friendly staff and great value ,1
we went in a group of at least 20 and everyone enjoyed their food and the fact that it was byob lol very much as someone who is allergic to both nuts and sesame it was also a bit of treat to be able to safely eat asian food the staff were very receptive when i explained my problemos i highly recommend getting the udon kimchee soup it revitalised me to the max ,1
really good service of two lovely young waitresses but i just don t know if i liked the food it was either extremely spicy or sweet the restaurant itself was a bit grubby it could do with a lick of paint throughout and it would really brighten the place up ,1
the food is amazing very authentic and the size of dishes is more than enough prices are very reasonable but you can only pay by cash will definitely go back ,1
i booked this for a birthday celebration and chose the banquet options the food was flavoursome and delicious and because it s byo the evening was even better value too we were a large party in a small restaurant but the service was always efficient and friendly but great for couples small gatherings and families too i ve recommended some dishes but it was all delicious,1
i ve been eating here for a few years with no complaints but when we ate here recently they said they are no longer serving sushi it s still on the menu which is a bit misleading i usually have a beef bibibap which is delicious but decided to try something else and had some starters and seafood yaki soba i agree with other reviews the starters are a bit expensive and the yaki soba was bland and not very nice my friend wasn t that impressed with his meal choice either the service was a bit patchy which i can forgive if the food is good but sadly this wasn t the case this visit i would still highly recommend the bibibap menu and please can you can start serving sushi again thank you ,1
first time going to a korean restaurant we had very reasonable meals agree that the starters are a bit expensive but there is complimentary kim chee and also pickled radishes there are also japanese dishes on the menu so there were things that all in our group could eat there were a few things on the menu that weren t available on a friday night which was a bit unexpected dessert for one but we were very happy to have eaten here and my daughter knew many of the korean songs so she was happy too bibimbap excellent whether vegetarian beef chicken or raw beef byo also ,1
an amazing array of korean dishes came to the table in no particular order as they were cooked it made for an interesting meal the restaurant is plain in decor and it doesn t need to make an effort as the food speaks for itself it is byo which makes it reasonably priced but not cheap the food was spicy hot and flavoursome and we enjoyed all that we ordered ,0
been here several times because it is byo which is great recommend number 75 on the menu can t remember what it is called but it is spicy and comes absolutely boiling hot so takes a while to eat also reccomend the bibimbap if you don t like spice as much you can add as much hot sauce as you like then you mix up all of the dish and it is delicious would say avoid the starters as they are very expensive 5 7 and you don t get as much compared to the mains good place for a birthday meal staff are great ,1
in contrast to the more westernised korean pan asian spots in bristol this place is a good shout if you re looking for the real deal it s byob which is most definitely a plus in terms of value but implies a casual milieu would recommend for an impromptu dinner with friends we were all very satisfied with our food excellent kimchi although i found the menu to be quite extensive and so it took some time for me to decide i plan to visit again to try some of the more adventurous menu items ,1
visited dain korea as a family for an evening birthday meal was not disappointed it s tucked away and is definitely not what you expect from the exterior the waitress was lovely and attentive easily explained ingredients of particular dishes we visited as a group of four and over ordered the side dishes are very generous almost a full meal in themselves and we were given plenty of banchan korean side dishes to accompany our meal food was delicious 2 4 had seafood dishes that were perfect no nasty after effects either super spicy and warming dishes main meals plenty it has a byob policy on larger quantities of alcohol but does serve 2 types of asian beer along with soft drinks would 100 reccomend visiting we ll definitely be back ,1
went for a date night meal with my girlfriend and was not disappointed the food was delicious and the staff were friendly and very helpful if you like korean food then you must give this place a try ,1
our son has been asking us to eat in a korean restaurant for some time and this weekend we tried it this restaurant is just a small very unassuming basic establishment on bristols bohemian gloucester rd the decor is very street food style the staff very welcoming with a smile the menu is quite extensive and unless you have some guidance it is possible to select the wrong dish i has a sweet beef style dish accompanied with iceberg lettuce and a soya bean sauce my son had a dish with mixed veg and an egg on top and my wife had a chicken glass noodle one all really tasty and cooked well its byo and they offer free water we will return ,1
my partner who lived in korea has been bemoaning the lack of good korean food in bristol we stumbled on dain korea by mistake and went a bit wild when ordering food dumplings korean pancakes rib broth and bibimbap later we were stunned and happy everything was authentic and tasty and we enjoyed the restaurant s relaxed byob approach ,1
having heard good things we my girlfriend and i were excited to have dinner at dain korea last night unfortunately it didn t live up to the hype my yaki soba chicken was distinctly lacking in chicken and was generally bland and tasteless and my girlfriend s spicy seafood soup was oily and didn t have much to it this is one place we won t be going back to ,0
bristol is full of different cultures and cuisines that come with such a diverse population dain korea offers a mixture of korean and japanese cuisine i came here for the korean food and was not disappointed ,1
such a nice korean restaurant nothing posh but tasty healthy and affordable food you can bring your own drinks and the guy who attended us was really nice i ordered bibimbap with row beef and it was really good more than enough food 100 recommended ,1
must try ive lived in korea before and the dishes are all up to standard the service is good and it is great value i recommend the kimchi soup la galbi and the mandu will go whenever im in bristol ,1
as a head chef myself i have to say that was thee best food i have ever eaten what ever you are paying you re chef pay him some more the man was born to cook ,1
so many times we ve just pitched up with a like 20 people sometimes more and they just deal like yeah it s nothing yo here s some bang up kimchi and other yommy foods you bring your own booze and they supply the food i love the bi bim bap cos you just get to stick the chopsticks in and mix it up and shovel it into your mouth soooooo goood i literally love it thanks dain ,1
we really enjoyed our meal here on friday night delicious food good service and it s bring your own booze which makes it a cheap night out ,1
been going to this restaurant for a while the staff is super friendly and the food is amazing you even get the little kimchi and radish as a starter which is brilliant also for those that never tried it so they can have a bit of a taste before ordering the bbq is cooked in the kitchen instead of at the table but it tastes lovely so it s still worth it would also advise the tang su yuk for a starter if you re a fan of sweet and sour ,1
good value for money food with great service and impressed of trying korean food for first time i will definitely revisit,1
increds food ignore the questionable shop front branding the food is hashtag amazeballs order the korean bbq it s different levs totes like ,1
staff are really helpful large selection of dishes food was good but not excellent in my opinion i enjoyed side dishes and accompaniments better than main ones,0
went for a meal on tuesday with my wife and have to say we both left with big smiles on our faces initially the decor does not look that promising but that is not really the point here it is functional and clean however the food is what makes this place a real find we had a starter of prawn mandu which are like gyoza lovely flavour with a beautifully crisp edge for mains i had the beef bibimbap which was beautifully flavoured essentially a rice dish but once all the ingredients are mixed in the bowl as is the custom the texture and flavours are luxurious and finely balanced my wife had a noodle dish which was just as good they do sell some alcohol but you are welcome to bring your own for a small corkage definitely will be making a return visit,1
i went there a few days ago and i have to say that it was one of the best meals i ve had in recent years the staff were really attentive and helpful the interior looked really nice and the food was amazing i am really looking forward to the next time i can visit i would recommend this to anyone looking for delicious korean food ,1
love this place i come about once a month everyone i take just adores it too delicious food good service and amazing value for money ,1
went to dain korea for a small party the food was nice and the service very good they were very accommodating and happy for us to decorate etc we didn t feel rushed and was a really nice atmosphere bring your own alcohol too which is great reasonably priced and their hot pots are really nice i ve had better sushi but wasn t bad my only gripe was that it took them a very long time to clear our table once we d finished eating but only a minor thing would recommend ,1
highly recommended this place took me back to my time in south korea authentic korean soul food that i dearly missed seeing the chef attend all tables and asking how the food was really blew me away something i haven t seen in a long time great touch definitely felt the love in the cooking most of all its veggie friendly no pork in the broths thank you for the great experience and catering for vegetarians our new favourite restaurant ,1
went there twice not disappointed i would say it serves a more authentic taste compared to the others simple place but with great food price range from 10 to 15quid a person i d recommend the sundubu jjigae kimchi soup but the pancakes are very nice too ,1
the restaurant is very simple and basic the service is a bit slow but the food is great you can bring drinks from outside a recommendation always ask for information about what the dishes are spicy sometimes they are too ,1
having the best sampled the best of korean restaurants in new malden surrey i was excited to hear of a korean restaurant in bristol visiting with friends from london on a wednesday night i was a little disappointed to see it was a korean and japanese place and was even more disappointed in the menu there was key korean and japanese dishes but not enough of either however the korean pork dumplings were not shop bought and very tasty always a good thing the bib am bab was very average not something i d be rushing back to have ,1
had a staff night there on thursday 17 03 2016 we were a table of 6 and i can tell that we all felt the same way the food was really good and fresh however service was not that good we asked for 6 wine glasses byob by the way and we had to ask them to change three of them as they were really dirty one of them even had some salad on it then we ordered some starters to share which were all great and 6 main course as 5 of us had our meals served after 45 minutes wait after we finished the starters which were not cleared from the table one of us didn t get his meal we had to ask the waiter for the 6th meal which they forgot about i noticed during the dinner that other tables were not cleared until someone else was arriving overall a descent restaurant with good prices but a poor customer service experience ,0
went here with two friends on a tuesday night we waited ages to order and in the end just went up to the till we then waited 40 minutes just for our drinks and again we only got them because we went up and asked we were never asked if we wanted anything else and when it came time to pay again we had to go up and ask after waiting for ages there were other people in the same situation i even saw one customer walk out after waiting without being served it s a shame because the food is actually quite nice i just don t think they understand the concept of customer service no matter how good the food it s not worth the ordeal ,1
i first went here in september 2015 and i just can t stop going it s so reasonably priced delicious and authentic both the japanese and korean food never fails to impress great as a nice 1 2 1 evening meal with partner or with a group of friends the fact it s byob is just a bonus ,1
highly recommended if you want good food i lived in korea between 2002 2004 and since returning to the uk i had struggled to find a place that served proper korean grub until now dain korea s food is as good as anything i ve eaten in the motherland the decor is a little basic and it s not the place you d go to for a posh night out but if you re after some top nosh then give this place a whirl ,1
my son recommended this restaurant but said it was very basic and that the food might not be for us he was wrong this place provides korean and japanese food and is situated on busy gloucester road it is unimposing from the outside but is clean and smart inside cooking is done by two very busy chefs in full view of diners the waitress was korean japanese herself and was only too willing to guide us through the extensive menu most of which we couldn t understand i had a prawn tempura wrap to start with a bit of square of salmon and some wasabi which i was wary of from past experience delicious and for my main a large bowl of rice shredded veg mushrioms prawns etc with a bowl of miso soup to mix in with it all topped with an egg yum my husband had a chicken starter and a pork curry for his main which was too hot for him the waitress was very concerned and said the chef would tailor any food to the required degree of hotness on a scale of 1 5 we had green tea icecream to finish you can bring your own wine but there is japanese beer on offer which my husband said was very good and a variety of teas and soft drinks this is an unpretentious busy little place which provides super fresh tasty food at a reasonable price the staff were lovely and for us it was nice to go somewhere a little different and guess what we are returning with visiting family in less than a week by the way my malasian friend kniws this place well and recommends the chilli daddy takeaway they do those too ,1
waitress service is poor missing out drink and food orders they definitely need more training or be valued well as part of the team we had to physically approach them and chase up missing drink and food items as it was difficult to get their attention if they bothered to ask if we had sufficient drinks or if the meal was satisfactory they will soon have realised the missing orders trying to pay took a minimum of 15 mins despite physically going up to pay to try speed up the process note we were not the only ones in the same situation as others repeatedly asked for their bills staff were slow at cleaning up other people s table on a hot summer day which is not pleasant to look at poor management of table arrangement and greeting of new guests doesn t create the best atmosphere observation sitting new customers down but not giving them a menu until the guests asked for a menu and taking another table s order who sat down after them at which the guests did comment food was ok starters are better than the mains if i m honest there are better korean restaurants in bristol will not be returning or recommending to friends family ,1
this is our second time of eating at dain korea the food is lovely and the service was quick the simplicity of the cafe restaurant give the place authenticity we would definitely go again ,1
a great selection of vegetarian options the staff are really friendly well priced with byo and amazingly tasty food i will be visiting here again ,1
the place is so good i loved it since first time i went there very tasty and authentic korean food almost same as the food i tasted when i was in korea the staff is very friendly and would advise on the menu but the most amazing thing about them is that they do delivery although not everywhere but if you are in the centre or around you are good me and my friends order delivery all the time and it s so useful especially during exam period when everyone is too busy with revision but you have to order food for more than 20 which is ok if you are ordering with your friend ,1
the menu includes many japanese dishes sushi teriyaki etc but most are korean i told the charming and friendly waitress that i did not know korean cuisine and asked her to recommend she pointed me at bibimap it s served in a hot earthenware bowl with boiled rice in the bottom making it crispy layered with cooked vegetable choice of chicken beef pork prawn or tofu beef recommended and taken and an egg so the flavours go down into the rice served with your own bottle of red chilli paste so you can control how hot you want it i loved it and can t wait to go back we washed it down with a 375ml bottle of 18 rice wine that went well and had a clean slightly vodka like flavour with a couple of side dishes and salads we happily paid 20 each and left feeling full and satisfied the same menu is served for lunch mostly at reduced prices a definite bargain ,1
we had a meal at dain korea for mothers day we ve been there before and i have gone for a cheap lunch on a few occasions positives it serves authentic korean cuisine the price is very reasonable mains around 10 00 there is a great value cash only lunch menu the korean set meals are good value if you are hungry potential improvements the interior is a little tired previously it was a short lived burger joint and it can lack a little ambiance that said i quite like unpretentious cafes and restaurants on the day we visited we had two children they are from the lunch menu and my wife and i ate from the main korean set meal the kids liked their noodle dish udon chicken noodles our menu consisted of lots of side dishes as per korean kimchi pickled vegetables bulgogi bbq beef kimchi pork and tofu stew boiled rice we were full after that cost us around 58 00 with drinks total we took our own wine conclusions if you want to try korean food a little different from your normal asian food you should give it a go good place to go for lunch too perhaps not that a romantic setting for couples give it a go ,1
have eaten here many times now friendly staff very laidback slightly shabby interior most importantly amazing food always feel good after eating here little extras like miso kimchee etc really make it plus it s byob ,1
unpretentious cafe i went there for lunch and ordered from the lunch menu a bibimbap with beef it had a nicely fried egg and very fresh veg and some accompaniments miso soup kimchee and a few other things which a wash down with a watery citron tea the food was very good value the full menu was while not as cheap as the lunchtime specials also reasonably priced i gather it gets busy at night it was not very busy at lunch though and the staff had no trouble not i think a place for romantic nights out but a good place to enjoy with friends ,1
the restaurant doesn t look much from the outside and when you go in the decor is fairly basic but don t let that put you off the food is really authentic healthy delicious byob best dish we ve tried the raw beef bibimbap ,1
this was our first time here food was incredible staff were lovely and we really liked how chilled out it was here byob for 1 corkage per person you can t go wrong will definitely be going back ,1
i popped in here with friends for an evening meal the building and interior were shabby the staff were friendly but very slow and not very attentive the food was of quite bad quality for the price i had a chicken dish which was very salty the plus side is that it was byo i will not be returning in a hurry ,0
we went to dain korea twice and both times we loved it we liked the sushi and the squid we also really liked the presentation of the food it looks good honest we didn t like the atmosphere that much as it looks a bit weird but who cares if the food is simply amazing we really liked it and we will return ,1
i ordered the bambinbap sp which was slightly spicy tasty and filling it also came with a side salad pickled ginger and a small miso soup overall a pleasant find with attentive service ,1
on our last day in bristol we popped into this restaurant for lunch although it looked pretty empty the ambience was a bit on the dark side and it didn t appear very clean with an open kitchen that looked like a corridor once we sat down we ordered mandu which i guess is the korean version of gyoza the flavour wasn t too bad although i would have left it a bit more in the pan to get the pastry a bit crispier the seafood pancake which didn t appear to have much seafood inside with spring onion wasn t too bad either although the middle was uncooked and had a gluey consistency then came the masterpiece we orderered 2 katsu curry chicken and pork from the special lunch menu but we got was 2 cutlets in gloopy sauce that i believe is a different dish and it remainded me of branston pickle i had the pork and the colour of the meat was almost black and had a funny taste my fianc√© s chicken was a touch better but again it had a funny taste we complained and they asked if we wanted something else and because we were famished we asked if we could have 2 portions of mandu instead which were the best part of our meal but this time they arrived undercooked and one of them was cold in the middle i don t have a problem if they were frozen before but at least they could have been cooked properly it is not that they were too busy either there was us and another table so why the rush we complained again and the waitress then later on the owner pretended that there was a misunderstanding regarding the curry well that wasn t our problem as we had ordered from the daily special menu and there was only one curry option anyway the owner wanted us not to pay the bill but we insisted that we wanted too and at end we paid for the 2 dishes we ate this has to be one of the most unpleasant meals for sometime ,0
went in for lunch and really impressed chose two things off the lunch menu bulgogi beef and a rice bowl both were only 6 99 and were fantastic they were generous portions and they gave a miso soup and kimchi with the lunch both dishes were really tasty and hot amazing for the price we will definitely be back and look forward to trying more service was really good and the waitress was very friendly ,1
having wanted to visit dain for a while we were finally in the area when the restaurant is opened had a simple meal of fried rice chicken udon and dduk buk ki the soup for the udon for quite sweet for us but otherwise we enjoyed the food there is nothing pretentious about this restaurant no gimmicks just decent korean food which to us is a plus we could feel that the chef put his heart into the food he prepared thank you ,1
have been to dain korea three times now and have never been disappointed the service is always quick and friendly the menu is quite expansive and the food is extremely cheap given its quality byob keeps the bill right down and means that this is a good place to dine with friends or in reasonably large groups some might find the atmosphere a little strange it s a small place packed with seating and the decor manages to be both sparse and eclectic black and white prints of amsterdam canals anyone for me this is a big plus it s unpretentious and friendly and is a good sign that they are rightly concentrating on the quality of the food over style makes for a relaxed and welcoming meal the food is always fantastic can t get enough of the kim chee and the dolsot bibimbap is excellent at this price you might expect rice dishes and the like to be stodgy and nondescript but the spices and flavours are vibrant and crisp there s an array of dishes and a lot of reasonably priced starters and sides so you can dip in and out of several different foods menu is a bit light on vegetarian food which is why i can t give 5 stars but that s more down to korean cuisine i suspect than the restaurant itself there s also quite a lot of tofu and vegetable dishes to keep you busy i always leave feeling happy and satisfied as well as a little drunk long live dain korea ,1
been several times my favourite is the jjam bong which is consistently delicious like nothing else i have eaten in uk great prices and byo so you cant go wrong free kim chee and soy beans make the meal a great and sociable experience dain korea is a winner ,1
the food was delicious really quickly served with excellent staff 100 recommendable never tried korean food before but now i am looking forward to try a new dish ,1
found dain suddenly in gloucester road we went there often reasonable price and authentic cook highly recommend ,1
one of the best places to eat in bristol a personal favorite which never disappoints will be returning ,1
we found dain korea by accident but it is now one of our favourites have been 5 times the food is pretty amazing great quality fresh tasty and plenty of it plus the added extras like the miso soup are fab for us i think one of the biggest reasons we go back and have recommended dain korea to our friends and family is because it s very good quality the staff in particular are incredible friendly make us feel really welcome the sushi is pretty good too and smashes places like yo sushi out of the park the only thing i would say is that because it s made to order there can be a wait when it s busy but what would you rather microwaved precooked fast food or beautiful fresh dishes it s a no brainer it s also byo for 2 a head bargain love it can t wait to return ,1
just had a lovely meal here tasty food friendly staff and reasonable price the decor is a little plain but the food and service make up for it definitely recommend 7,1
fantastic food fantastic price fantastic staff we can t get enough of this place we visit quite often as it s so close to my work the food is always freshly prepared and tastes fantastic dolsot bi bim bap is my favourite but try to try other things too as the menu is just brilliant the d√©cor is not much but you come here for the food ,1
eaten here loads of times and it is a favourite for us a bit scruffy but is clean and friendly and the food is delicious there s a really substantial menu of korean and sushi and i m trying to choose some of the many dishes i ve never heard of but keep going for the amazing bibimbap also recommend the bulgogi ,1
as a korean i can vouch for the dishes authenticity really tasty food with fresh ingredients apart from the prices my favourite thing about the place was probably that they don t use msg which can be commonly used in cheap oriental restaurants friendly service too the place is cheap and cheerful don t expect luxurious decor if you are new to korean go for the classic bibimbap dish ,1
had a good lunch here great value they have both pork and chicken korean curry dishes on the menu i had the chicken which was great but i would have said that the sauce was nearer to sweet and sour than curry i enjoyed it though my wife had the pork and that came with a completely different sauce nearer to the sort of curry sauce you get from a chinese takeaway anyway she enjoyed it too although its a byo they do sell korean beer ,1
been to this place a few months ago price was very reasonable but the foods taste was quite average atmosphere was a bit boring too nice staff though ,1
we visited dain korea when it first opened and it was instantly one of my favourite restaurants it offered great authentic korean food and a great price i was however a little disappointed about my last trip there it seems like standards are starting to slip the portions are getting smaller and the quality is starting to go down a little mince beef in the bibimbap rather than steak i also feel that the prices have raised slightly that said this is still by far the best korean restaurant in town far far better than surakahn and i will be returning soon just maybe not quite as soon as i would have done based on my first impressions ,1
this friendly welcoming bring your own restaurant is one of gloucester road s gems the food is delicious the prices low and the service laid back and friendly the hot earthenware dishes that cook as you stir them with the tangy chilli sauce are delicious and the noodle soups really really tasty so grab some friends grab some bottles and head down there asap enjoy ,1
good selection of smaller dishes and the bibimbap is also very good as it is bring your own this helps to make this a great budget option for the area ,1
good food good service good price highly recommended for those who enjoy korean authentic dishes ,1
this restaurant offers an extensive menu with plenty of vegetarian options service quick and very friendly recommended,1
the food was quite nice but this is why i will never go again 7 30 me and 7 friends arrive 7 55ish our orders are taken 8 00 a korean family also of 8 arrive 8 55ish having received and eaten their food the family leave 9 10 my table s first starter appears ,0
the lunch deal was unbeatable price for such a korean meal very authentic and we got served by a lovely korean lady if you are here in bristol you must go and try this little restaurant ,1
the food service and atmosphere is brilliant authentic korean cuisine at great prices a byo so another place different tastes a great place to visit especially if you are feeling bored of the standard fine dining michelin menus ,1
i ve been searching an authentic korean restaurant in bristol for ages and this place has finally satisfied those cravings don t let its unpretentious decor fool you despite being only a few months old dain korea shows good variety in its menu and the dishes taste authentic none of those letdown flavours adapted to cater to coddled less adventurous palates we re talking about the real deal here the staff are polite and attentive and we were promptly served complimentary banchan of braised soy sauce eggs and spicy pickled shredded cabbage while we waited for our order i ordered tteokbokki and pajeon both of which were delicious my companion who was a korean cuisine virgin prior to this visit was happy with his bibimbap as well only been here twice definitely looking forward to dining here again soon ,1
i have been searching for a decent reasonably priced korea restaurant for years i spent a year living in south korea and generally i find that korean restaurants in the uk are overpriced and the food is unauthentic this is certainly not the case with dain korea typically under decorated which is pretty reminiscent of real korean restaurants the food is the main attraction i m so happy we went here and we will be coming back again and again the staff are great and the lovely waitress who told me she was from daegu was really friendly i hope to go back once they are selling alcohol because the only thing that would make this better was if they also sold makgeolli as far as the food goes it was all exceptional the bulgogi is as amazing as it should be and the bibimbap was delicious the tang su yuk was a real treat as since leaving korea i haven t been able to find this anywhere else i d recommend anyone who hasn t tried this to do so even if you ve never tried korean food before you need to give this a go you won t regret it 10 10 Í∞êÏÇ¨Ìï©ÎãàÎã§,1
very authentic korean food and great range in fact better than the korean food we ve had in central london reminded us of our time in seoul staff are freat too once you get chatting to them will be back the next time we are in bristol ,1
as a korean living in the uk i have been waiting for a decent korean restaurant in south west for more than 5 years i would recommend this restaurant as the one of the best korean restaurant in the uk in terms of food quality and price also staffs are very kind and you can bring your own beer or wine my wife and i have tried 7 dishes so far and we are going to try all dishes in their menu all of them taste exactly same as what you can have in korea ,1
the interior is very basic and they could have done with giving it a lick of paint before opening but i like the food a lot and the lunch menu in particular is incredible value i went with my wife and our bill for two meals and two drinks was under 12 i have already visited four times and will be back ,1
i have been waiting for the authentic korean restaurant here for such a long time and this restaurant finally opened a month ago and i m very pleased with their quality food everything is freshly cooked and their lunch deal start from 4 99 with miso soup and other appetisers we ve tried bibimbap yukgaejang kimchee jeon yang yeum chicken and sushi byo as additional bonus ,1
having lived in the far east this the most authentic korean food i have found in the uk prices very reasonable and lunch menu extremely good value good selection and good taste nice sushi too ,1
we love the bbq here and the seafood pancakes the staff is nice i absolutely recommend this place ,1
i visited there with my friends yesterday it was a little late their service was not so quick but the food was delicious i ordered ox tail soup which is very delicious ,1
my family and i were very pleasantly surprised to find this gem there was eight of us with each getting something different and everything was delicious a couple of us ordered grill items which you cook at the table yourself on built in grills each meal entree comes with numerous sides which is not clearly stated on the menu but trust me are brought out to you all the same our server was efficient and patient she answered all our questions cheerfully and trust me we had a lot i would highly recommend this restaurant ,1
brought our son here for his birthday he s a freshman in college and we asked him what he wanted for his birthday dinner and he said korean he just happens to have a korean professor who lives in the area and this is her favorite place we have our own favorite spot near home and this one was just as great the service was great and the food was delicious we loved it we now now where to go for korean food when we re in town ,1
from the outside cafe korea is just a restaurant in a strip mall but when you go inside it s a whole new world i was stationed in uijongbu and remembered delicious bbq places where you can grill at the table this is a rolls royce version of those bbqs the service is outstanding and the food is delicious and bountiful i got the bulgogi entree and my mom got dol sot bi bim bop we didn t know that we also got all of these yummy side dishes too the daughter of the owner came over to check on us it was an excellent experience i wondered if their food would taste like the bulgogi i had in the 80 s back in korea and it was i have rated a lot of restauraunts if i could have given this 6 stars i would it was 44 out the door including a generous tip ,1
my daughter and i tried out cafe korea for a special dinner and we were not disappointed the price for the dinners using the grill is up there but it was a relaxing interactive meal they served our choice of proteins thinly sliced and marinated with vegis and then we grilled them at the table also came with rice and a variety of korean side dishes the staff was very helpful and friendly ,1
good authentic korean food good service and price plenty of choices deliciously spicy not toxic great location looking forward to trying other korean dish ,1
i ve eaten at all the korean places in the indy metro area and this is the best very fresh and unique offerings this new location on allisonville has been total remodeled very modern every dish i ve had here has been over the top delicious keep up the great work we love you ,1
on arrival this is at the end of a strip mall the inside is pretty neat and clean the service is good i ordered the dolset bibimbop comes in a scorching hot bowl the most exceptional part was the beef very tender and tasty the best restaurant bulgogi i have ever had in a dish i was a little sad they did not give me cabbage kimchi for a side dish but other than some small traditional korean things i was hoping for the experience was great and i will definitely be back ,1
cafe korea s new location is easy to get to spacious and very pleasant inside they have bbq which i did not try but plan on it i lived in south korea for a year and absolutely love korean food especially bbq the food here is very expensive compared to korea but we re not in korea this is a novelty restaurant worth trying this food is very close to authentic and it is very good the side dishes were zingy those who worked there were fast efficient and very kind so great service overall again worth it ,1
we stopped by their new larger location last week for lunch great experience we ordered the soon dobu as well as the dolsot bi bim bop both came with a starter of a lettuce salad in addition we got 5 great little side dishes zucchini kimchi turnip kimchi sesame bean sprouts slightly sweet roasted potatoes salad and a great fried tofu the entree portions were very generous and both were just delicious food is very fresh and super flavorful very good value in a nice atmosphere with good service we will definitely be back ,1
this restaurant was recommended by a korean co worker in my wife s office when we visited most of the diners seemed to be of korean or oriental descent and appeared to be enjoying their food this is food i am unfamiliar with for the most part but i did enjoy the beef dish that i ordered we will probably give it another try ,1
this restaurant offered delicious korean cuisine accompanied by efficient friendly service i had the dol sot bi bim bop a dish of shredded vegetables and beef on rice with a hot sauce also the environment was clean warm and welcoming i would highly recommend this place ,1
this was our first time trying korean food luckily we went with friends who have been here before and knew good things to order we ordered several appetizers and entrees to share everything was good and there were very few leftovers the kimchi was excellent also try the plum and raspberry wine give this place a try for something different ,1
i came here with three family members we tried different dishes for appetizers we had the fried dumplings which were great the edamame which was a little dry and korean pancakes which were very good they served all tables a trio of kimche mung beans and greens we ordered separate dishes one was kimche soup which was well liked one was dumpling soup which was just okay another was spicy pork dupbop which is a dish of vegetables some pork and sweet potato noodles delicious but not sweet as you might think over rice and one which was delicious and other dish which i can t recall and was well liked decor is nice service was great ,1
i got here often it has great food and a sweet atmosphere it is well worth going and enjoying what they have to offer ,1
i think the first time i ate here was in 2012 or 2013 and the food was amazing and visited once every couple of weeks it s still a good option since there are only a couple of korean places in indianapolis i visited again recently and it seems like the quality has gone down a bit so that was disappointing to see ,0
i had the squid and spicy chicken and both were very tasty everything else was fresh and nicely prepared along with the food the service was fantastic and the whole restaurant gave off a positive vibe i definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some good korean food for lunch or dinner ,1
we come here from time to time and service is always good but can get a little bogged down when busy it is not a big place which adds to its charm but it can also get full very quick the menu has the basics i prefer more korean bbq foods but everything here is fresh and well prepared give it a shot ,0
don t know how ididn t know about this place right in the neighborhood great food that even my kids enjoyed ,1
i love this place i went there with my friends a few days ago and i just loved their food and service i ordered dolsot and one of my friends ordered galbi and they both were really delicious the seafood pancake was so good too i just wanted to eat more and more i ll be back to try something new ,1
first not sure why the address for this place is show as ny instead of in now to the review of the restaurant the staff here are always friendly and hard working they can get a little overwhelmed when busy so you may need to show some patience overall they do a great job the place is simple but clean and well maintained the food is very good and pretty authentic not a breath of items on the menu but they have all the staples so if you are craving good korean food then this is a solid choice ,1
cafe korea is an excellent source of various korean foods there are a lot of classics such as soon tofu dolsot and kimbap that they do wonderfully the little appetizers they provide along with the side dishes are awesome i definitely recommend this place to anyone seeking to try authentic korean food ,1
first off the restaurant was clean and well presented the staff had smiles on their faces as they greeted and took care of me on my stay when i ordered it took a little while but it was well worth it the food both looked amazing and tasted great if you happen to be in the area and are hungry definitely check out cafe korea asian food lovers will agree that this place is awesome ,1
i went to cafe korea with my sisters and i truly loved the experience there my sisters and i ordered dol sot bibimbop galbi and jokbal and they were great the salads the dressing side dishes and the kimchi were great to start off when we got our entr√©es we just couldn t stop saying this is so good the whole time it was the best korean food we ve ever had and we were more than satisfied with the experience the authentic taste of the food and of course the service after we were done eating we also got some desserts and loved them i ll definitely be coming back and can t stop thinking about the food i had on that night ,1
this was my first experience eating korean food a friend and i went to cafe korea for the first time but it won t be our last our server was very friendly and helpful he checked several times during our meal to make sure there was nothing we needed i ordered 1 bulgogi from the lunch menu the beef was very tender and the flavor was wonderful i never dreamed that korean food would be so good i ll definitely be eating at cafe korea again soon ,1
tonight was my 4th time in cafe korea seated and ordered our drinks ten minutes after party of 12 came in a lday staff asked me and my husband to moved to another table such rude we went out and will never go there again ,0
good and fresh reasonably priced i will return and enjoy again gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood,1
i m from south korea and can recognize the authentic flavor of korean food this place is small but the quality of the food is great clean and friendly service this is my go to place when i crave korean food fyi this place does not have the korean bbq grill ,1
i love asian soups and cafe korea doesn t disappoint i have had the soon tofu and the spicy beef broth i would recommend both the sides of spicy cucumber garlic spinach bean sprouts and kimche are a great addition service can be a little slow be careful if you order over the phone the staff does not speak english very and you might get a 25 dollar dish instead of the 8 dish you wanted ,1
first time there got a table at lunchtime but it was the only one left authentic korean restaurant but would have benefitted from a better description of the dishes for those like me who had not sampled this food before staff very friendly and food reasonably priced mostly delicious ,1
the king prawn starter was delicious the katsu chicken not so much the vegetable dumplings were not good the veggie in our group took a bite and suspected that it contained meat only after 3x going backwards and forwards were we able to determine that they contained quorn this was very poorly handled and none of the servers seemed to know what the dumplings contained my main was half cold 1 4 warm and 1 4 hot i was told that the hot bowl would warm my food but my friend had the same and her rice was too hot to eat so this cannot be the case i chose to leave my food we also ordered spicy chicken wings which tasted nice but the waiters walked past our table multiple times and we were only given napkins after about 15 minutes they seemed to avoid the table seemingly not wanting to deal with the situation and probably not wanting us to ask for it to be removed from the bill the bill came to 72 for the 4 of us we paid 20 each but would have been justified in not leaving a tip and requesting for the veg starter and main meal be removed it s a shame that they didn t offer a better level of customer service i can t in good faith reccommend them to others ,0
the food we all got was great fresh ingredients made fresh when we ordered the service was excellent as well one of the better korean experiences we ve had in london ,1
friendly and authentic korean reataurant reasonably priced perfectly located for a meal before getting on the gatwick express or otherwise travelling through victoria station will be coming back ,1
very good food every time when i go around victoria i go and eat there book your table before you visit the restaurant as it get busy ,1
we went before seeing hamilton as the set menu looked great the staff were friendly and they amended our set menu to include veggie options liked the bibimbap served in hot stone bowls incredible dumblings and green tea good value good spot ,1
took a lunchtime meal for 8 here service was efficient and friendly as i d expect from koreans having visited korea on business i was always sceptical that food and ambiance could be emulated just outside london s busy transport hun at victoria i m very pleased to say that the korean owners have done a fantastic job the food was fantastic and a sufficient variety to give choice without compromising on quality freshness and time from order to table the venue is plain simple no nonsense intimate social dining definitely worth a visit and really good value in my opinion,1
really nice staff that sorted our table as soon as they were able to even though the place was packed plus the food was so delicious and lovely would definitely come back ,1
a group of friends and i visited here when we were seeing a show at the victoria and wanted a quick bite we re very glad we did as its a lovely place with a friendly feel to the service and great food they catered well for my many dietary needs and gluten free is marked on the menu go hungry as the portions were large i recommend the citrus tea we arrived at around 6 and got a table but even on a monday evening in january it was soon packed ,1
we were looking for a place around victoria that wasn t a bland chain and fortunately found this every dish was delicious the chicken wings are amongst the best i ve ever had and the bibimbap was fantastic if you are going to eat here make sure you go before the show rush or book in advance you have to book at least the day before as there were queues out the door as we finished ,1
lime orange was a superb find we had possibly one of the best korean meals i have tasted outside of south korea lime ornage does not take reservations and it is clear why the restaurant is packed from opening until closing with queues out into the street throughout the evening tables are jam packed into this tiny restaurant with hardly any space between them to squeeze into but nobody minds being a little close to the next table of diners in an ultra busy restaurant where the service never falters and the food is exquisite lime orange is situated directly opposite the apollo victoria where wicked has been playing for the past several years it is a block from victoria railway station two blocks from hm passport office and three blocks from buckingham palace so there is no end of potential passing trade lime orange is a family owned and run business and so service and food quality are given the highest priorities no matter how busy the staff were they remained attentive and friendly we will definitely return in the future ,1
waited for 20 mins for a table which was fine as we didn t book and it s quite a small restaurant delicious starters calamari some of the best we ve had tasty mains beef staff are busy but polite and friendly reasonably priced would recommend top marks,1
truly excellent experience booked for lunch in this cosy and friendly restaurant prior to seeing hamilton welcoming atmosphere good straightforward korean menu very good food truly excellent service with timely warning about meal delay recommend highly ,1
what a gem this restaurant is found it looking for something close to wicked noticed don t take bookings from 6pm so booked for 5 30pm which proved ingenious seeing queues out on the street great vibe staff very helpful and attentive food just superb gluten free options can t fault highly recommend,1
visited pre theatre and weren t disappointed we both went for the set meal number 2 which was gorgeous plenty of food good value and friendly staff one slight criticism it felt like we were being rushed as the main meal was served before we d finished our starter well worth a visit though ,1
chose this restaurant as it was within walking distance to our hotel and based on tripadvisor recommendations this is a small floorplan with very limited seating and we had to wait on the sidewalk fortunately less than ten minutes before being seated as there is not a waiting area reservations are strongly recommended my spouse had the beef bulgogi and i had the bullgogi hot pot rice and sides were all extra and not included food was good and the hotpot was excellent for the cold damp evening ,1
great food helpful service big portions reasonable prices popped in for lunch before checking into our hotel absolutely delicious ,1
booked a table for friday night for 4 people definitely book as restaurant was totally full all evening and people waiting outside enjoyable food and very generous portions very nice service didn t feel rushed worth noting they didn t take cards the evening we visited so needed to go out for cash will definitely return,1
i made a reservation for 2 people by calling the day earlier i turned up the next day on time but the whole restaurant was packed and not a single table was empty i informed them of my reservation and the 2 staff didn t seem to be aware of the reservation so i was made to wait for 5 6 mins while they cleared up a table for me we ordered the following to about 45 veg mandu not tasty just average but the apple cide vinegar dip was nice spicy calamari the best dish of everything we had the sauce is sweet spicy pa jeon seafood pancake was tasty as well kimchi fried rice shouldn t have ordered this as it was bland and the kimchi wasn t as spicy or tasty served with a lovely miso soup however chicken spicy noodles had a spicy taste and the chicken tasted good very generous portions of the rice and noodles we were sated at the end the mains were disappointing but the starters were good would prolly order their popular bibimbap next time the staff were friendly and the service was quick considering the crowded place however i felt that 2 people are not enough to run the service and reception definitely need another pair of hands on a busy afternoon ,0
great food great service and reasonable prices in london right next to victoria station this place is gold food was delicious and the staff were on hand to help you with the menu and make recommendations if required bibimbap is excellent and very authentic ,1
we went on a busy saturday evening about 18 30 the place was almost full but we were seated quickly and took time to look at the amazing food other people were eating we ordered a starter and main course each and were more than satisfied with the portion sizes the spicy calamari and pa jeon pancake starters were very good and no sooner had we finished than the main courses arrived my wife loved the chicken bimimbap and for me the beef bulgogi with lettuce and rice was truly delicious we had a kimchee cucumber and pear salad with the mains and that was outstanding fresh and delicious it s a shame the korean beer was tasteless but everything else was great and the young staff were really helpful and friendly recommended ,1
the fact this restaurant is always packed for dinner service speaks volume good quality korean food for a reasonable price in a great location very friendly service and although the restaurant frequently has a queue it seems to move quickly ,1
nice stuff good foods the portions are larhe do not try a ramen and a bibimbap for one it was too much but you can ask for takeaway everything was very delicious you can pay by card kedves szem√©lyzet finom √©telek az adagok nagyok ne akarj rament √©s bibimbapot enni egyszerre egy embernek t√∫l sok de elcsomagolj√°k minden nagyon finom volt √©s lehet k√°rty√°val fizetni ,1
we called to book only to be told dont worry plenty of tables arrived 15 mins later none available luckily for us a table didn t turn up so we got it never eaten korean before didn t really know what to order everyone around us had mountains of food that looked amazing went for a few starters and beef bullogi for main so tasty unfortunately nothing we ordered looked like what the other diners were eating but nevertheless what we got was great we asked the waitress for a few dishes pointing out some other tables but due to the language barrier she didn t really understand what we meant chopsticks and a spoon for the soup i guess no other cutlery we used the chopsticks for about 5 mins then gave up and went for the spoon feeling a little silly as everyone else using them with ease tables a little sticky reasonably priced food would definitely go again very tasty food i just wish we could have tried more next time ,1
on a saturday evening without reservation we tried our luck we looked inside from the window it looked packed with a party of three already waiting we were immediately welcome by a waiter who told us 5 minutes and shorter than that a table became free and we had our place the dishes came surprisingly fast and were simply delicious and authentic we have extensive travel experience to korea we loved the katsu the bibimbab the bulgogis they even import a korean beer despite the hectic of a saturday night the staff was all calm efficient and very personal and friendly the prices are reasonable overall a great family run establishment that we can warmly recommend ,1
very good modest korean restaurant i ordered a korean soup and the dish was so large that it would be enough for the whole lunch or dinner,1
great food and service i m very happy to have found this lovely korean restaurant it s close to both the apollo palace theatres but i strongly suggest booking ahead if you want to go pre theatre not on the day as they don t take same day bookings we were just lucky they found a table for us plave was very full even though 6pm i m looking forward to coming back trying some other things on the menu ,1
went there with some friends before going to the theatre we had booked which was just as well as it got very busy and by the time we left at 6 30 people were queuing outside we were not sure what to order so in the end went for some starters and one main course which was plenty between the 4 of us the tempura prawns were amazing and the calamari in the sticky sweet and sour sauce was amazing the staff were really nice very cheerful and helpful highly recommended,1
absolutely fabulous food amazing value for money evidenced by the queue waiting outside worthwhile booking in advance make sure you have cash as they don t take cards would recommend beef bulgogi ,1
this is a busy small place that is a few minutes walk from victoria station the service is attentive and swift i loved the advice to newcomers like me so that i didn t fall foul of the super hot spicy sauce the food was served quickly and was really tasty and there was plenty of it two beers two starters and two main courses for 50 what s not to love,1
we were a really large group nearly 20 people about half of whom were korean they were really impressed it was excellent food and completely unpretentious really good value it s a popular place and gets very busy highly recommended ,1
i ended up going here twice on my most recent visit to london once of my own volition and again on the recommendation of a friend i wasn t complaining the first time i had the tofu salad and jeon both ok for vegans although a couple more members of staff could do with knowing what is and isn t vegan on their menu these choices were decent if a little greasy the second time when i went back i had the tofu bibimbap and that was pretty impressive the restaurant is very close to victoria station and not all that expensive it was packed both nights and i would go again ,1
a colleague recommended this place as i was meeting a friend straight from work and it was close by given that we went on a monday evening and were starving at 6 30 we figured it would be pretty quiet there but the place was heaving always a good sign we had one of the set menus and i have to say it was all delicious the staff were all friendly and realised that we hadn t had korean food before so explained how we were supposed to assemble one of the dishes we d have worked it out but was nice to be helped my only slight negative point was that the tea was very weak i had the korean tea which had some flavour but my friend had the green tea and said that it tasted of nothing but hot water i will definitely be back,1
what to say other than this place exceeds expectations i m very difficult to please when it comes to eating out and really struggled to choose from the menu as everything sounded good the staff were brilliant giving us time and answering many questions i was recommended the kimchi soup which comes with rice others had the noodles or bibimbap when they arrived portions were huge but with lots of flavour the bibimbaps were incredible but i think the kimchi soup won hands down hot spicy and full of ingredients i can t wait to come back to have it again can t stress enough how great this place is ,1
we arrived early but still had to wait about 20 mins for a table since it s quite a small restaurant the food was slightly too salty but the bibimbap was tasty as a whole ,0
never eaten korean before this is a popular place and i can see why food is great and the service was good too great selection on the menu will definitely be back booking is essential was full seconds after it opened at 12 00 ,1
was looking for somewhere to eat before going to see hamilton and stumbled across lime orange on tripadvisor we booked by phone the day before and were glad we did we arrived just after 5 30pm and by 6pm they had a queue outside we shared a number of starters including chilli chicken wings and the giant prawns we then tried the bibimbap and beef bulogi with lettuce and rice both fantastic friendly staff quick service amazing food highly recommended ,1
we were running very late for grabbing a pre theatre meal saw this restaurant directly opposite apollo victoria theatre was busy so assumed it must be good food we weren t disappointed we d never eaten korean before so asked the young waiter what we should order but also explained to him our time restriction we only had approx 40 mins to be in out he recommended a few dishes for us and assured they d be with us within 15 mins very impressive service and food ,1
we needed to find food quite quickly in the victoria area a look on ta and we decided on this place no regrets ambience busy tight packed bustling eatery first thing we noticed lots of koreans always a good sign when people recognise their own cuisine service despite pressure friendly and attentive very good food outstanding we had seafood bibimbap for me and chicken katsu with udon noodles for her but we shared each other s both very good the bibimbap possible the more interesting and in its massive stone bowl stayed piping hot for ever drink a had hite beer fine with the food value good we felt given location 31 68 inc pre included service charge the tip would have been bigger if it hadn t been included verdict i want to go back ,1
first time having korean food and ill definatley go back food was amazing and just the right portion size the waiting staff were fantastic made me and my friend feel welcome and couldnt do enough the guy who i think was manager was excellent well manerd polite and courtious overall excellent i will make sure i tell all my friends family and collegues to visit in my opinion a hidden gem reqlly enjoyed,1
i ve actually been a couple of times since my last visit it is really good chicken bibimbap excellent busy as usual pleasant service quick very reasonably priced well deserving its loyal clientele ,1
the food is excellent highly recommend the spicy fried chicken and seafood pancake as starter every dish is amazing and worth its price definitely will visit again ,1
great little korean restaurant with helpful staff just outside victoria station isn t the biggest and you can t make same day reservation so be prepared for a wait but the food is worth it ,1
everything pictured below cost around 33 including drinks the picing is incredibly good the only downside was that we were a party of two who wanted to order the bbq but could only do so if we ordered 3 persons worth of food my friend and i wanted to try a variety of foods so opted for a shared selection the ttoboki was incredibly tasty but as avid spicy food hotpot eaters it was not spicy enough when i return i plan to ask for it to be spicier the staff were incredibly nice specially the young man who served us we order just before the place became busy and eventhough the place was packed he was still incredibly polite and full of smiles as we sat down he offered to put our suitcases and bags outback we didn t catch his name but we arrived at the place on the 03 06 and would really like to praise him for his servicing ,1
we booked a table for 4 before going to see bts at wembley stadium and had a great time the staff were very friendly attentive both over the phone and in person the food was incredible full of flavour free ingredients and presented very well they also played great and recent k pop music which was a real treat for us the place was very busy so book in advance if going on a saturday like we did would highly recommend going here ,1
the food simply is truly amazing and authentic korean after spending more than 6 weeks in south korea back in 2002 and loving it i have been trying to find their great flavours everywhere never could until i found lime orange in london a true trip to the south korean kitchen ,1
after reading the reviews and having walked past the customers queuing up outside for quite some time we went for dinner we came early and managed to get seated with no wait you can only make a reservation if you plan on dining two or more days out the inside is very small service was very attentive for starters we had soy chicken and the cucumber kimchee both were excellent for mains we had the beef bibimbap and the beef bulgogi both were mediocre no real flavor very disappointing if we do go back it won t be anytime soon ,0
great little place after checking a number of web sites we visited this little gem food delicious fresh service very good and it was packed with people from way before 7pm suggest you visit expecting a short wait but well worth it ,1
perfectly located for the apollo theatre wicked this is a great place for a pre show meal they open at 5 and when we arrived at about 5 past there were already 2 tables seated by half past the restaurant was full and people were waiting we were asked if we had a reservation which we didn t and i would certainly recommend booking if planning to arrive any later than we did the food was well explained on the menu and the friendly staff were on hand to help make recommendations service was extremely quick in fact we were in and out in just over an hour and the food is all brought out as soon as it is ready without a clear gap between courses this might bother some people but i didn t feel like we were being rushed the food itself was beautifully presented and of good quality having not tried korean food before i found the flavours a little disappointing slightly bland compared to some other asian cuisines but i think that s more personal taste overall i would definitely recommend the place for a value for money pre show meal if you like asian food ,1
looking for a restaurant near victoria we came across this one a bit of a wait but well worth the wait for nice korean food will be back ,1
it is a tiny place and there was a bit of a wait when we arrived but staff was very professional and handled the situation well when the food arrived it was so delicious it was definitely worth a wait good choice of vegetarian dishes i had kimchee jeon and kimchee bibimbap i have a serous kimchee obsession lately and it was yum my meet eating companion loved his spicy calamari and seafood udon we also had some korean plum wine for the first time and it was distinctly different to japanese variety we are familiar with but equally delightful altogether great meal and excellent value highly recommended ,1
came here for dinner prior to going to see wicked at the apollo the food was brilliant it tasted amazing and was well presented the staff were friendly and polite too i would definitely recommend this restaurant and would eat here again ,1
we called in for a quick dinner for 5 people before seeing a 7 30pm wicked show staff were super fast food was amazing and the portions were huge great value meals ,1
great find close to the station and some bars looks smaller from the outside but seats a decent number of people casual restaurant perfect for a small group of friends fabulous food and cheap at around 25 per head with just one alcoholic drink not a place i d take young children in buggies as space is tight though they had barbecue heaters but they didn t turn them on for us because it was so busy instead they cooked it in the kitchen and brought it out but that worked for us would definitely go again if in the area ,1
whilst my stay in hong kong i ve had my fair share of korean food the bibimbap i tried was definitely authentic like they say it is will be trying out the other dishes as the bulgogi looked good too recommenced to book as it is a relatively small restaurant ,1
we were looking for something different as we were down in london for the theatre and the lime orange reviews convinced us to book we arrived at 5 as it was opening and the staff were lounging about in the dining area so not really a great first impression as a vegetarian the choice was limited so i had the tofu udon and the ladies had chicken katsu udon the noodles were barely warm and generally the meal was bland and uninteresting the people on the table across looked to have made a better choice with a colourful rice dish perhaps our fault but if experimenting with somewhere for the first time in future i will be asking for recommendations and help from the staff serving ,1
we dropped in for a quick bite before seeing hamilton in march 2019 we were able to sit at a 4 person bbq table although there were only 2 of us and ordered the pre requisite 3 bbq dishes as a result it was quiet when we arrived just before 6pm but filled up really quickly excellent friendly service with helpful tips really delicious food a fun experience bbq ing on the griddle in the centre of the table and very reasonabe in price would recommend book in advance ,1
i went there with 2 friends of mine and we went to try korean food for the first time together it was really tasty and we ended up leaving with perfectly full and satisfied stomachs also the staff were really educated and even guided us through the mixing of bibimbap which we were really pleased about i m thinking about going there soon in the future ,1
the only reason i didn t give lime orange five stars is because our soup was not hot other than that the food was excellent ,0
i had a bibimbap and it was delicious well presented and i got a really good sized portion 10 the staff were friendly and we were able to sit at the table for a while even though they were full i would definitely recommend booking ahead the only slight downfall is that it s a bit dark inside and the decor could do with a few finishing touches ,1
small restaurant with close tables menu ok but food disappointing starter was ok it the main course lukewarm and somewhat lacking staff not that friendly ice cream pretty good though difficult to give a positive recommendation ,0
fantastic restaurant great interior very relaxed and really nice food staff are friendly and always happy to help great value for money ,1
excellent korean restaurant polite and efficient service the food is amazing absolutely recommend it ,1
walked past this restaurant every day without a 2nd glance for 8 years today gave it a try before going to a show all i can say is i wished i d paid more notice years ago ,1
first time here bit of a queue outside but they took my number while we popped down to weatherspoons for a cheeky glass of wine the food was really interesting and tasted fabulous really enjoyed and would comeback again staff were really friendly and service was good ,1
lime orange is an excellent pre theatre restaurant choice very reasonably priced and beautiful tasting high quality food never having eaten korean food before the staff we very helpful and informative advising on the best dishes to try we had delicious pa jeon to start followed by beef bibimbap and pork belly i cannot recommend this delightful family run restaurant highly enough i understand why lime orange don t take bookings between 18 00 19 30 so my tip is to get there early 17 30 latest if you want to get a table and enjoy this delicious food without being too rushed a queue developed at times but was quite fast moving ,0
great place to go before seeing hamilton food was excellent in good portions and reasonable for london would definitely go again you need to book though as it s not a big place ,1
we happened across this restaurant after the hamilton matinee show at the victoria palace theatre we hadn t booked and it was really busy but we were seated within 15 minutes we chose the set menu with vegetable dumplings as starter bibimbap with chicken and miso soup a glass of house wine and a green or korean tea it was 20 a head excellent food and flavours and very friendly staff well worth a visit but book a table if you can ,1
wanted a non chain restaurant and happened to walk past looked in looked okay and decided to try it 1st time korean for me and had the seafood bibimap generous with the ingredients very tasty and chilli to taste take care with the squirty chilli pot next table s bbq looked good will go again ,1
congested place and to be honest the food was also not good since i am a vegetarian i tried one of the vegetarian options those were limited too but it wasn t tasty at all the staff was friendly and service was good ,1
we ate there yesterday and were not impressed a small uncomfortable restaurant where we were crammed in like cattle the 2 starters and the main s all arrived at the same time one of the chicken wing starters actually oozed blood when you bit into it bloody hazardous to health on complaining they took 3 50 of the price of the wings would not recomend at all ,0
my team and i are regular visitors here at lunch time as we work in the area we all love this place the staff are very friendly the food is good and great value the restaurant is quite small and is always busy so booking is recommended for parties of 4 at peak times despite being always busy they take the orders and serve the food fairly quickly our favourite dish is the bibimbap a korean rice dish served in a bowl that it is so hot that anything that touches it sizzles for minutes they have different options and i have personally tried this with tofu kimchee and seafood but they also have meaty options like chicken and beef if you order a bibimbap you get a miso soup included in the price 10 too it s difficult to find a better restaurant in the victoria station area ,1
visited lime orange last night and would highly recommend it to anybody service was excellent and food was beautiful ,1
in the tourist trap zone adjacent to victoria station remarkable to find this genuinely good reasonably priced authentic korean restaurant packed with koreans to underline that seafood korean pancake very good an excellent chicken bimimbap nice squid a good seafood bibimbap as well water 40 in total very nice service i seriously rated it ,1
we stopped here for lunch awaiting a bus from victoria food was very good service was quick despite being fairly busy prices reasonable ,1
we happened to run into this little restaurant that had three spaces on a bar overlooking the street great food wonderful service would go again if staying longer ,1
came here for a post theatre meal the starters of chicken katsu and spicy calamari were both great ways to kick things off with flavourful and large portions but the mains were a bit of a let down in comparison i had the beef bibimbap and my friend had the seafood bibimbap whilst both were pleasant and interesting for a pair of korean food novices neither dish was particularly memorable or packed a real punch on the flip side the service was attentive and informative throughout i d definitely come back again if only to try something different as again all in all our meal was decent ,1
i ve been to this restaurant about five times over the last year or so and i can confidently say the the following three things have been consistent every time the food was nice enough the price was more than i d expect the service was rushed and bordering unpleasant i can explain a little more on points 1 2 the food is ok authentic can t say nice enough yes but overpriced within a few minutes walk of this place you can have the same quality korean food at a much reasonable price on point 3 the space is very limited and that s fine but to be asked to wait until the rest of your party arrives before you are given a table because they don t want to lose a seat is not something i want to do to me that tells me i am valued less than the restaurant selling a table seat i accept that this could be perfectly fine for many but is not for me overall average is the best i can give this place and i m aiming not to visit again ,0
went there last night prior to a show arrived just at the right time as 10 mins later there was a throng of people waiting to get in superb ,1
very good portions and a good selections of starters the kimchi was just ok but the bibimbap i had was really yummy the dumplings were tasty too ,1
this is such a nice place to enjoy good food in the heart of victoria the restaurant has a very nice menu with very generous portions and a very good price quality balance the staff members really give me that feeling that they are genuinely enjoining working there i m very glad to have find this place and i will certainly recommend it upon any other nearby chain restaurants as i definitely think that central london lacks in this type of restaurants which truly deserve to be recognised and promoted a very satisfying experience ,1
i came her with some friends for lunch and the place was really crowded however the owner was able to find a table for us the food was really tasty and price honest for the quality and the location we shared some starters and i loved my main course seafood noodles i will eat here again to try other options of their menu ,1
i went there with my daughter and her partner for a family get together before christmas i was very impressed with the service and the quality of the food we had prawns and squid to start followed by the table bbq of chicken pork and beef with lettuce to wrap plenty of kimchi and hite beer it was a real treat would definitely return ,1
and oh so good food was very delicious and full of flavor great for a pre theatre meal go early as it can become loud ,1
my korean friend brought me here for a healthy wholesome meal between the kimchi felrmented vegetables and the dumplings the lovely soups with beef fish pork which neveer get cold as they are served in special font pots and great spices sweet as well as spicy and the famous korean bbq we were really spoiled for choice this is a small restuarant so dont expect luxury but the service is quick and efficient as well as polite ,1
came here on a friday evening was already full so had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table they don t take bookings between certain times but was the wait worth it it s quite a small restaurant with quite closely packed tables but we felt this added to the atmosphere the service was friendly and efficient and the menu has a great choice of both meat and vegetarian options the food we tried was all delicious and reasonably priced they also do takeaway it s good to know before you go that this place is cash only will definitely return ,1
delicious food and excellent service especially considering it was a crazy busy saturday night we would definitely recommend it ,1
came as a recommendation from a friend was absolutely not disappointed the service was fast the food was delicious and felt freshly prepared the quantity was good and felt value for money very knowledgable and attentive staff would absolutely make the trip to go again i had the beef bulgogi kimchi and korean tea with rice and lettuce even though it was a rainy day the line was out the door and it was busy i look forward to finding my next excuse to make the trip to return there ,1
went in for lunch and it was the best and lowest cost meal of our 4 day trip they have a daily special which is only 5 90 to eat in it was a soup with dumplings and very nice we also had the most delicious chicken wings katsu chicken with udon noodles a portion of rice kimchi and a big bottle of water and it was just under 35 including a service charge service was quick strongly recommend,1
we ve eaten bibimbaps and bulgogis all over korea so we were delighted to find that lime orange was absolutely bang on in being authentically delicious with me loving my pork bibimbap and my wife loving her beef bulgogi mine had lovely tasty fluffy rice with 7 or 8 different types of steamed vegetable pork that had been marinated in a delicious sesame y marinade and a little bowl of miso soup on the side while my wife s dinner consisted of a beautiful fragrant soup with delicious marinated beef in it with a bowl of that lovely rice on the side i was also delighted to see they serve makgeolli that lovely korean light rice wine the place was absolutely heaving with a queue of people out the door many or whom were koreans though we only had to wait 10 mins or so to be seated the service was quick and friendly and we left 40 mins later with smiles on our faces it is cash only at lime orange but there s an atm right across the road we will most definitely be back ,1
this small clean friendly place is perfect for a pre hamilton or whatever show you are seeing at the palace repas korean food can be light even vegetarian spicy or not depending on your preference and the kimchee won t upset the people sitting next to you in the theatre i had udon noodles supposedly spicy they weren t piquant but they were fresh and umami my friend had bibimbap with tofu both dishes were generous and filling we shared kimchee pancakes like potato pancakes but crunchier service was unobtrusive and efficient arrive early for pre theatre because it gets crowded the closer you get to show time ,1
i love this place bustling and friendly with super spicy tasy warming authentic korean chow bulgogi bibimbap kimchee and lots more beside always makes me leave happy and replete try the korean beer too recommended whole heartedly ,1
ate here last friday and it was out of this world soo tasty and generous portions came as it was close to the theatre and we had look at reviews beforehand it did not disappoint would definitely go back if in the area,1
you need to get there early to avoid having to queue but the food is excellent and the service is quick and friendly an ideal place to go for a pre theatre meal ,1
went for dinner with my husband and ordered cucumber kimchee beef bimbibap spicy chicken bulgogi kimchee jigae ramen we love the cucumber kimchee and beef bimbibap but the chicken and ramen was too spicy for us however some people might like the spicyness so this is relative the atmosphere is typical asian cafe place but it did feel a bit cramp but i think that is because the restaurant was trying to pack as many seats as possible to maximum sales which is understandable the service was good and the staff was friendly also this place only take cash so bear that in mind in summary this is definitely an option for a pre theatre meal and i would go back again if i am around the neighbourhood and if i crave for asian food ,1
great food good service and no line before show in october but it was completely full when i left at 7 pm the bibimbap is great and plenty of food would not have had room for appetizer though they looked stellar on other tables,0
stopped by after a matinee it s across the street from the apollo victoria and we were told there d be an hour wait we put our name down in the queue and 20 minutes later we got a call saying a table was ready we were only a few minutes away arrived quickly and were seated in the back of the room the vegetable mandu and the chicken bibimbap were good and coupled with a great show the food helped make it a good day ,1
we had a great dinner after arriving to london on a late train from the airport very close to victoria station great korean food tasty and abundant really nice service although the kitchen was about to close surely coming back ,1
really good bibimbap my friend had bulgogi also great small restaurant near a few theaters so it was very crowded when we arrived and had a line out the door soon afterward but worth the crowds and the wait in my opinion black sesame ice cream for dessert was unusual and delicious ,1
i came here because of the reviews and wasn t let down the food was great and was authentically korean the bibimbap was exactly as i had in seoul and i was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of the kimchi as well as the size of the dishes it isn t michelin star dining but i m glad it s not the service was really good and it is excellent value for london i ll be back here ,1
we ordered 2 noodles and some starters and they were tasty the staff were very friendly too as we stayed there a good 2 hours after we finished our meals and they never chased us away ,1
we had the beef bulgogi pork bibimbap and chicken katsu udon and they were all delicious and generously sized mains are under 10 which feels like good value for the quality and location right by victoria station and the theatres showing hamilton and wicked service very friendly too ,1
the restaurant is conveniently located less than 5 minutes walking from victoria train coach underground station so it s a busy area but the restaurant itself is away from most of the footfall while we were there however at around 7pm midweek the restaurant was consistently busy with a constant stream of diners it s pretty small and quite cramped and it was slightly uncomfortable having the waiting diners practically hanging over our table so ideally they should carve out a space for waiting but then they d lose a table and welcome income i imagine that said the food was great not quite up there with kimchi in holborn but far cheaper good portion sizes a really good selection on the menu was pleased to see a tofu bibimbap for veggies the kimchi wasn t quite spicy enough for our liking and the mandu dumplings were only lukewarm but these are mild complaints and all was worth it for the delicious bibimbaps which we spent an hour over scraping the burnt rice from the bottom of the stone bowl don t judge it s the best part the service was also very friendly all the servers were smiley and helpful if a little rushed overall i would recommend a visit to lime orange with friends for something quite quick or even alone at the window bench but probably not for a romantic meal or for somewhere to relax with drinks for a while ,1
we d been to the nearby victoria palace theatre we saw this place on trip advisor and had booked a table for after the show just as well as it was really popular the food was really tasty and service was really quick it s a small place and they clearly want to turn the tables quickly so not a place for leisurely meal nb cash only a great find ,1
this is a little gem near to the apollo victoria every dish was well presented and made like korean food should be it s small and cramped but for a meal its great service is friendly caution is advised since while we were there someone two tables down by the door had their cell phone stolen by a beggar who covered it with a piece of paper before making a sharp exit ,1
we were lucky enough to get hamilton tickets at the victoria theatre lime orange is literally 3 mins walk away food was great we shared two starters prawns and calamari then each had a main and the grownups tried the korea beer great service food and value we were in and out within an hour which suited us ,1
came here for a casual meal with a friend who s quite a foodie based on reviews and the apparent halal options available there is a sign in the window saying the chicken is halal and the member of the waiting staff that i asked said the same we hadn t booked and managed to get a table but it turns out we definitely should have if we were planning on coming a bit later we got there a little before 18 30 i think the restaurant got packed pretty quickly but not in chaotic manner and the service we received was very friendly and helpful throughout as i said in the title the yangyeum chicken which we shared for starters was very tasty and the batter was crispy for mains i went for the spicy chicken bulgogi with lettuce and rice and my friend went for the beef bibimbap which comes with rice i enjoyed my dish even if i struggled a little at first with how to eat it the waiter did very politely give me advice when they served it and my friend described their course as okay i d say i m less fussy than them p but if they say it s okay it s good for me and if they say it s amazing it s really good for me tables were generally clean though one or two spots seemed a little sticky and the toilets well i can only comment on the men s seemed to be kept in good condition food was served fairly promptly and despite how busy it was getting with people waiting to be seated we were never made to feel rushed or anything like that it s not that expensive but i think if it were a little cheaper i d be likely to come back here for a quick bite if i were in the area P,1
met an american friend visiting near victoria for dinner although they do not take reservations between 6 and 8 pm i called during the day and while they made no promises they had a table waiting for us which was great the mandu bimbibap and bulgogi were all excellent the hite beer cold and fresh all this for 45 for two it s not a fancy place but definitely authentic attentive service as well ,1
an unexpected delight very close to victoria station which is otherwise surrounded by chain franchise eateries cosy homely atmosphere very friendly service and the food was yummy my nieces and i ordered a couple of starters and a couple of main dishes incl the beef bibimbap which was recommended to us by someone waiting for her takeaway there was more than enough to share and we thoroughly enjoyed it it was my first time at a korean restaurant and i would definitely go again but please check the state of your bathrooms regularly ,0
i cannot recommend this restaurant enough firstly the food was to die for so we ordered the tofu udon the salmon teriyaki korean bbq beef and a bibimbap and every single one of us adored the food each dish was exceptional the tofu was the best tofu i have ever eaten it was just delicious it s a really cosy restaurant and because everyone is sitting quite close together you become quite friendly with the people around you if you want to the price is very reasonable as well considering it s in central london everyone has to visit this place we love it ,1
came here for a post theatre meal great food and good service even though it was packed and we had to squeeze onto a small table ,1
we had a pre hamilton lunch fantastic korean food great starters a must try is the cucumber pear kimchi service was courteous food came fairly quick quite a useful tip it s also 5mins from victoria station we ll be back ,1
i ve been to lime orange several times now and always get the chicken bibimbap and have never been disappointed the dish is hearty hot and full of flavour i could eat it over and over again the atmosphere in the restaurant is cosy and always full of people the service is good some improvements could be made when it comes to the waiters and how they deliver the food on the table especially as the dishes are so hot apart from that no complaints ,1
given the good reviews we were looking forward to this for a pre hamilton meal but we were disappointed on a very hot night we tried to go for a light option of sharing several starters but everything came deep fried and not particularly tasty won t go again,0
we chose this place because it was close to the apollo victoria theatre we were having dinner before going to see wicked my kids also wanted korean food i thought the food was ok frankly i think we get better korean food in toronto it was just different i was surprised that the side dishes weren t included even kim chee we had to pay separately again this just might be the way it is in london back home it is all include in the meal my wife thought her salmon was done very well ,1
visited this restaurant again as from my friend request we were enjoyed the first time this time we ordered similar dishes cucumber kimchi and set menu when we asked for some raw garlic and chilli sauce like last time the waiter said they don t have any raw garlic and chilli sauce really korean restaurant don t have raw garlic and chilli sauce it s traditional way to eat the bulgogi beef with raw garlic wrap with lettuce sounds like this time we walked in to the wrong restaurant ,0
stopped here before going theatre lovely food nice ppl nice taste of korea wish it was a little bigger would definitely go again,1
this small family run restaurant located near victoria station features largely korean or korean japanese fusion food that is well prepared tasty and affordable we had fried tofu statter and soya chcken starter i have had the fried tofu starter before and it was excellent tonight it was just ok but the soy chicken was excellent succulent fleash indide crispy on the outside and rich with umami flavours for the main course we each had the soecialty stone bowl meal called bibimbap mine was beef my friends was chicken seven vegitables are combined with the meat of your choice and rice and this is cooked in a hot stone bowl miso soup is served alongside hint pour the miso into the bowl to sizzle off the rice from the bottom of the bowl excellent tasty dish dinner for two including two starteres one side dish two main dishes and two beers came to under 50 ,1
stopped in here before seeing wicked the food was great and reasonably priced for the area around 7 12 pounds for a main staff were also very friendly and the service was fast would definitely recommend ,1
visited this restaurant before wicked came around 17 30 and 2 tables were taken it was getting busier around 18 15 very nice and delicious food nicely served in hot pot quick service around 35gbp for 2 starters and main meal to share with drinks recommended ,1
a small restaurant the service was quick and attentive we ate the cucumber kimchi which was excellent it contained thin slices of apple very refreshing for main course we ate the pork bipimpap and beef hot pot bulgogi also very good the price was very reasonable all and all an excellent experience i highly recommend ,1
just stopped by for a quick launch the service was very good the food came out fast and the food was excellent,1
went in for lunch and had an amazing time recommending getting menu number 3 if you are really hungry however getting a bibimbap per person will suffice,0
we discovered this place by mistake while we were waiting the train to the airport and since then it s a must in london if we have visitors we always recommend them to go this place the bibimbap is amazing and you should try at least one starter i would recommend to anyone this place if you re in the area ,1
a real gem of a place near the apollo victoria and victoria place theatres we got there at 5pm and by 6pm there was a queue food was excellent and i enjoyed the korean beer well recommended,1
a smallish korean restaurant that serves healthy meals with fresh ingredients the daily lunch specials are value for money if you want to give yourself a treat go for the different choices of bibimbap which comes sizzling in a hot stone bowl i like it that you can add the chilly sauce according to your taste top off your meal with a bottle of korean beer ,1
located bang opposite the apollo victoria ideal for a pre theatre dinner it was quiet when we arrived but quickly filled up our food was delicious interesting korean food which our waiter explained the best way to eat it we ordered a cucumber side dish which we didn t really enjoy however when the bill came we were not charged for this the waiter said he tasted it himself when he saw we had left most of it and he said it had not been prepared correctly so we were not charged great customer service recommended,1
we loved this meal and we liked the atmosphere a lot it was so busy and the staff were super quick we did have to ask to order for drinks and to pay but that wasn t a problem the food was good and the service was quick ,1
husband amd i wanted to try something new and decided on lime orange based on reviews really glad we did the food was very good it came quickly and was reasonably priced the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is very tight placement of tables so there is no privacy because the neighboring table is literally a foot away from yours and it was also pretty loud a great place to meet with friends but probably not the best choice for a romantic or intimate meal ,1
first time visit the restaurant after the show walk in early hours friendly greetings from the staff dishes were good portion tasty too seats are comfortable even in a small place even the price is really reasonable price ,1
we were so lucky to get a table here almost as soon as we walked in they were packed we had a show to see across the street at apollo victoria and were unfortunately a little short on time service was quick and friendly and the food came out fresh hot and absolutely delicious i haven t had korean food very often but lime orange is the best i ve had the spicy calamari we tried as a starter had a couple of pieces that were a little chewy but most were just about perfect i really liked their kimchi too i had chicken katsu udon and the chicken was crisp moist and the sauce was very good the noodles and vegetables perfectly cooked in my opinion my husband had the pork belly bulgogi with fresh lettuce leaves and he loved it the portion sizes seemed very generous to us and we both had to leave some on our plates leaving full and satisfied with our dinner it is a small place maybe a bit cramped if you re a bit of a larger build and they were completely full our entire visit i imagine they often are i m not familiar with meal prices in london but we felt that they were very reasonable i highly recommend lime orange and both my husband and i would happily return on another visit to london ,1
this is the second time i ve visited like before i let a family member order on my behalf as i m not au fait with korean dishes the food and service were excellent we really enjoyed our meal i said in my last review that i d return again and two years later i did no doubt i ll be back again one day ,1
if you want to try authentic korean food lime orange is the place to come the food is great the service is friendly and it is excellent value too try the calamari starter its gorgeous the spicy chicken noodles are delicious also careful though they really are spicy ,1
ordered a take away to collect and have to say the prawns and squid starter were excellent great enough to make you want to return to then restaurant the kim gui was just ok for me the chilli chicken and the chicken katsu udon didn t travel well the chilli chicken lacked some umph and the katsu just needed some more sauce or jus or something to help it along i think this would be much better in the restaurant the starters were truly tasty and i think the katsu will be better so although only a 3 5 i would go to the restaurant to try it out,1
on a visit to london we wanted to try something different lime orange was fantastic i had never heard of bimbimbap but it turned out to be delicious i shared with my grandson while himself had marinated steak great wine friendly and excellent service and good prices we arrived around 5 30pm the place very quickly filled up we look forward to our next visit ,1
visited with friends yesterday for dinner it was amazing delicious food lovely ambience and very helpful staff food taste is very good with nice presentation highly recommendable if you looking for korean food in london it s best in london five stars for everything ,1
i ll be honest we weren t supposed to be going to lime orange our first choice was closed but my colleague loves korean food and suggested lime orange and what a great second choice from the outside lime orange doesn t look much but at 615 on a monday evening it was almost full and tables filled as soon as they became free people obviously knew something we didn t service was prompt and friendly and the food was excellent this was my first korean meal so my colleague ordered two different bulgogi and some side dishes and i was instantly hooked fresh tasty well prepared and super tasty and very reasonable at 25 for more than enough food washed down with a korean hite beer each such an unexpected gem amidst the tourist rip offs in the area ,1
great little pre theatre spot amazing bibimbap and great service reasonably priced and the portions were huge would highly recommend ,1
very charming restaurant with real korean food even with teenagers a good choice the team is very flexible and managed to adjust the menus for our teenagers in one case they only charged 50 as our son made a mistake by choosing a soup great place,1
had dinner here before going to see wicked at apollo victoria theatre which was directly opposite the food was amazing full of flavour staff were very attentive and helpful it was very busy always a good sign would definitely eat here again ,1
me and my work mate love to pick up our lunches from lime orange every wednesday as they have special beef soup yukgaejang the beef soup is filling and really hearthy 4 50 takeaway for a portion and it is quite cheap and healthy as well my korean workmate loves their soup that tells alot about it i will definitely return they accept only cash for order below 7 and it can get quite packed during lunch time we used to order by phone and picked it up 10 mins later easier that way no queue ,1
lime orange has so many small tables fully occupied by residents and tourist the quantity of the food was enough so it was difficult to finish all also the tasty was great especially the quality of rice is very nice which is very important factor for their menu when you order bulgogi don t miss lettuce as side which is included always in korea ,1
the food was very nice it is value for money there were 10 of us and they did not mix up the order the food came in a timely manner the staff were also nice good korean meal,1
as the restaurant is within line of sight from the hamilton london theatre we went there to have a pre theatre meal food was so good we immediately came out of the matinee show and went back there for dinner the bimbibap is too good for words and the staff are very respectful and receptive to any patrons who suffer from food allergies definitely going back ,1
lovely atmosphere in this tiny restaurant the waiters could not be more courteous the food was delicious and great value for central london definitely worth a visit ,1
no complaints dropped in here while passing had to wait slightly for a table but were dealt with courteously food was first class waiter was very friendly and helpful ,1
this restaurant was near perfect for a casual bus inn luncheon standards such as kimchi bulgolgi and grilled meats at the table were served in good portions and were satisfying the restaurant was a bit noisy not not distracting the noise added a layer of confidentiality to the business discussion the restaurant has room for improvement the added chili was a limp bottled sauce there were no small dishes typical of more upscale places and the seafood in the bulgogi was small in size and a tad light in volume within the dish though the cuisine was geared for a british audience there were several koreans among the clientele prices were reasonable and service was good ,1
we stopped here for a bite to eat after the theatre it s close to victoria palace theatre so an easy walk wonderful food and service was exceptional they helped us choose several tasty entrees the bibimbap was great and noodles were yummy we will visit again,1
we loved our food at this restaurant tried kimchi for the first time and can see why it wows quick service in a deservedly busy restaurant we loved it ,1
this place is amazing you have to come and try the food it s quite a small space and if you haven t made a reservation then you are likely have to wait but its worth it it s the go to place for people that work locally good quality food at a decent price what more can you ask for,1
looking for a place to eat before the theatre we found lime orange on tripadvisor oh my we were seated as it opened at 5 as were several other tables the service was efficient but not rushed they are clearly used to the pre theatre crowd but oh my goodness the food it was delicious a korean food fan in our group ordered a variety of dishes for us and she was seriously impressed i just kept eating the food was fresh and plentiful and superb so concentrated were we on our dinner that we d not noticed the restaurant was packed and folk were waiting forget the theatre go for great food ,1
we were looking for a dinner before the hamilton show nearby we found a korean restaurant which is my favourite food we arrived at 530pm and there is not very busy the decoration is cozy but the table is a bit close to next table the food served very quick the waiter came to explain how we should enjoy the food he is very friendly and we spend some time to talk to him about korean culture as well the food taste so good that make me feel like i am in korean we finished our dinner within a hour and people was waiting for the seat therefore we left and heading to our show ,1
there are many fancy and expensive korean restaurants in london this is truly one of the best korean restaurants in london no wonder why the restaurant is regarded as 1 in tripadvisor highly recommended to try their tofu kimchee for the starter and hot stone bibimbap ,1
meeting a friend for lunch we thought we would try lime orange when we arrived it was really busy but there was a table for 4 available so we sat ourselves down and waited to be served after five minutes we were told that as there was only 2 of us we had to move and join the table behind us we did ask if we could stay on our table and other people join us but they wanted to keep the table for 4 free just in case a party of 4 walked in so we joined the other table although the current occupants were a little taken aback but there really was not much room for 4 and couldn t talk freely then table for 2 became available so we moved to the free table we were then told we couldn t have this table as it had been reserved so no one waiting a table for 4 and a table for 2 unused but we could only join a table already occupied by 2 people at the point we felt very unwelcome and decided to leave my view on the food can t be included but we definitively did not feel the love looking at other posts it seems we aren t the only ones dissatisfied with their seating technique if you want korean food then give it a try but if there are just 2 or less in your party then find somewhere a bit more welcoming ,0
absolutely love the food there had dinner for the second time and had not been disappointed the place is small so come early if you want a table ,1
great food visited on a wet busy saturday lunchtime when it was full but with a nice buzzy atmosphere we all had bibinbap and can thoroughly recommend them just watch your hands on the very hot dish service left a little to be desired but really good prices ,1
i met an old work colleague for a catchup over a meal at lime orange selected for its proximity to victoria and an interest in trying korean food i found the service to be brisk and efficient food great i had the seafood bibimbap lots of seafood delicious and my friend chose the pork belly with rice and lettice which he enjoyed too the restaurant has a row of tables galley style quite close together but we did not find this uncomfortable and were able to converse well beers were bottled korean and japanese offered and served cold we had an enjoyable couple of hours at this restaurant and although the menu may be somewhat limited compared to a previous visit i had to a korean restuarant the food smacks of korean flavours ,1
this korean restaurant had awesome reviews but their food wasn t anything special i mean it was tasty but it missed the final touch the service was quick and friendly even though they forgot one of our starters it was a bit overpriced compared to the quality of the food ,1
simply a great restaurant friendly and fast service well made and prepared food comfortable seating we only planned to go for lunch but enjoyed it so much we went back for dinner after that afternoon s performance ,1
we found this little jam by chance and what a nice surprise they do not take reservations during pick hours but the service is quick so we just waited 10 min our bibimbap were terrific and finally a decent size portion london is famous for downsizing all the foreign food remarkable kimchi i suppose homemade i would skip the cakes and the ice creams very average and bit overpriced our waitress was super nice ,1
amazing host and amazing fresh food must go back again quick service good quality and reasonable prices,1
great quick korean food right by victoria bibimba was delicious proper crispy rice bottom kimchi was good vegan and veggie options would defo go again ,1
we went to lime orange before seeing hamilton the distance between the theatre and restaurant is minimal if using google maps you are sent to the back of the building so maybe ask a nearby shop for directions if you are not sure the restaurant decor is basic but comfortable there is a takeaway menu available food was great affordable and came out promptly our server was friendly and efficient the bibimbap was amazing and reminded me of my travels in korea the kimchi is homemade and pairs well with the dishes the main dishes are a good portion size and will keep you full the barley tea is a really lovely way to finish the meal and tastes like coffee the only element of the meal i was disappointed in was the black sesame ice cream the concept is a good idea however the ice cream had ice crystals overall this is a good restaurant for those who love no frills yummy korean food ,1
delicious korean food very affordable under 10 for a main just a stones throw from victoria station ,1
popped in for a quick lunch before watching hamilton at the nearby theatre basically a korean one dish meal place their servings are large in fact one bowl could have been shared by the two of us since we aren t normally big lunch eaters service is no frills but efficient food is tasty and basic they only take cash so make sure you have enough,1
stumbled on this restaurant while on the way to see wicked awesome food great friendly service and great value for money we were luckily as we got a table straight away as soon as we sat down a queue stated to form with people willing to wait for a table that s how good it is ,1
my friend lived in ulsan for a year and was missing the food so we thought we d try out this place and it did not disappoint we had a fairly long wait for the table as it was busy not surprising being opposite a theatre but the staff were attentive and we had a nice chat with other customers waiting we ordered a bottle of soju between us jug of water japchae kimchee jeon cucumber kimchee and the spicy chicken bulgogi with rice and lettuce all dishes were super tasty and all worked well together along with all the dipping sauces on the table needless to say my friend lived the food and was impressed by how good it was compared to other places she s tried the only improvement would be to have other flavours of soju we ll definitely be back and most likely booking a table as well ,1
went to lime orange pre hamilton we both had bibimaps chicken and seafood and really enjoyed the food service was good the place was very friendly as it was pre theatre we only had the one course though it came with misu soup but others around us were enjoying other dishes so i would definitely reccomend it,1
first experience of korean food and it was delicious random choice from the extensive menu and we couldn t have made a better selection lovely polite staff and food appeared swiftly which was good as we were off to a show ,1
our first experience of korean food as with previous comments we weren t disappointed there was a reasonable range of options for us as vegetarians everything we chose was tasty enjoyable it s certainly a cuisine i d be keen to try again perhaps in a slightly less rushed less busy setting service was friendly efficient fast good value for money well located for victoria bus station,1
we booked this restaurant for 5 people four weeks ago we reconfirmed our reservation two days before as we were travelling 60 miles into london to meet friends for supper we arrived on time to be informed yes they had our reservation but they had no tables available we would have to wait standing for maybe twenty minutes and then he could squeeze five of us onto a table for four said he was sorry and they just overbooked tables this was said matter of factly it would appear to be their normal practice no free drink offered if we chose to wait we left and found a good restaurant nearby the front of house staff couldn t have cared less with such an indifferent cavalier attitude to customers you have to wonder what happens in their kitchen avoid at all costs ,0
we visited this restaurant before a show based on its good ratings and closeness to the apollo victoria we have eaten at a few korean restaurants over the years and this is by far the worst food was edible but average uninspiring and underwhelming felt as though minimum effort made for tourist trade service was friendly and helpful if not a little chaotic ,1
i should mention this is my first experience of korean food so i have nothing to compare it against we were keen for the kids to broaden their horizons and none of us were disappointed the food was very good and the service friendly and fast we also enjoyed the korean beer the decor is simple but attractive reasonably priced for central london great location right opposite apollo theatre they keep half the restaurant for walk in business we will certainly return ,1
ok so i m not the biggest fan of korean food but if you are this might be for you 2 mins walk from victoria station practically opposite and super fast service if you want to catch a train my tip is get there early before 7pm to be sure of a table ,1
first time in a korean restaurant excellent food very healthy service was quick highly recommended will definitively visit again when i m back in london ,1
i m staying in london for three months and have tried 4 5 korean korean japanese restaurants this is the only place we returned three times for dinner including tonight my wife and i are koreans we both agree this is by far the best korean food in terms of quality price and portion we found the place gets busy after 6pm so we started visiting right after 5pm just as soon as they re open for dinner two min walk from victoria station ,1
before the theatre we went here i have been here a couple of times first time when i went with my family and it was nice so i took a my friend and it was not nice as i experienced but i thought i will give another try it is near by the victoria station and we need something to eat before heading off to her majesty theatre we had kimchi pancake spicy chicken dolsot bibimbab chicken katu with udon noodle hot pot bulgogi the flavour was there but all of were over sweetened the korean foods are well balanced umami taste i think if they do work more of balancing the flavour then they will be buzzing with lot of people ,1
great korean food and wonderful service the menu is extensive so you are bound to find many things to choose from the wait staff was polite and attentive the restaurant was lively but not too noisy i had no problem find gluten free dishes four of us all enjoyed our experience at lime orange ,1
visited for an early evening dinner and found the food to be average overall my starter beef bulgogi was delicious and had a lot of flavour the kimchi pancakes were ok but tasted very little of kimchi the bibimbap was average fresh ingredients but very little taste it needed a lot more seasoning would i return no ,0
new discovery and finally able to try a proper bibimbap and it did not disappoint not a glamorous restaurant which is fine because the food is delicious and staff really helpful and organised can t wait to return ,1
my husband and i had eaten here in october on our first vacation in london we had pork belly and beef bulgogi the food was very tasty and the staff amazing the guy who served us the food helped us whith the barbecue and even explained to us how to use the chopstix kam sa ham ni da ,1
we were looking for somewhere for pre theatre lunch and called into lime orange excellent find great food excellent service reasonably priced i thoroughly recommend it and here s a tip for you order one bowl of bibimbap for two people and get some side dishes to go with it the bib has seven vegetables plus rice plus meat of tofu of your choice and is very filling ,1
we pre booked our table for a pre theatre supper with friends we had missed out the previous week when we popped in on the off chance although the restaurant was empty when we arrived at 5 30 it filled rapidly and was full by 6 30pm when we left we had not had korean before so it is difficult to say how authentic the cuisine was but it was served promptly hot and it was very very tasty we even had some tuition about how to combine the various parts of a meal into a traditional mouthful from a waitress well worth the visit,1
had the chicken katsu udon for mains and i completely reccommend the restaurant is very close to where wicked is shown and it was a very satisfactory dinner ,1
recommended to me by two colleagues one visiting from japan who goes regularly with korean friends great food we had a good mixture between us friendly quick service thoroughly recommend ,1
i m a big fan of korean food and this place has large portions extremely tasty food and all delivered super speedily with great customer service and surprisingly decent prices i went at opening time and was surprised to see how it was packed out so fast but now it is very understandable definitely would recommend ,1
great food great service korean beer sadly isn t too special but the food was what i was there for primarily ,1
food was great high quality as i expect of good korean only reason for 4 star rather than 5 is presentation korean tradition is to serve small complimentary dishes with meals and those were absent extra charge which is not korean tradition ,1
a small korean restaurant close to victoria station we had a time schedule to hold and asked for food that could be served quite quickly we ate bibimbap and were happy with both taste service and the time a place to recommend ,1
this restaurant doesn t seem to understand the seriousness of food allergies i have a very serious potentially life threatening nut allergy so when we arrived i specifically told the waiter that i had a nut allergy when we ordered our mains and asked him to go and check that the food didn t have nuts in after we d eaten our main meal which was delicious best bibimbap in london i asked a waitress for the dessert menu she said there was just green tea icecream for dessert so we ordered some when it came i tried some and i thought it had nuts in which the staff confirmed although they hadn t felt it necessary to mention when i ordered i thought this was really poor particularly as i d explicitly let them know about my allergy fortunately i only ate a tiny quantity of the ice cream so i didn t have a serious anaphylactic allergic reaction just stomach cramps and some difficulty breathing but someone with a more serious allergy than mine could easily have died from that so lime orange needs to do a lot better to support its customers with allergies i really wouldn t recommend eating here if you have serious food allergies ,0
thank goodness we booked place full to the gunnels ordered cucumber and pear kimchi belly pork bologi and beef stew and calamari kimchi was delish pork dish very bland needed something the beef stew was tender rich and really enjoyed it the calamari was battered with sweet chilli sauce batter so thick and chewy couldn t taste the main star i would go again and try some other items as love korean food ,1
turned up at 12 when the place is still empty ie just opening by half past it was full including a pleasing proportion of people who looked as though they might have some korean heritage deep fried prawns were superb and vast for only 8 50 and the bibimbap chicken for me beef for her was so good that we ate till our stomachs groaned normally i d only be in victoria to go somewhere else this place might just drag me back ,1
went here after we tried to check in early at the goring a bustling place a hot spot for locals and the food did not disappoint the calamari was awesome and the short rib soup as well very good prices for this area in london ,1
love to try out local ethnic cuisine good korean speaking of locals there were quite a few locals there if you go after 6 plan on a wait service not bad for a korean restaurant though i realize i m making generalizations slightly different concept you pay extra for the ban chan side dishes and even white rice minimal cost though very limited ban chan too but a nice change if you ve been eating a lot of british food ,0
i took my team for an early evening meal and arrived at 6pm for the restaurant to be full so was pleased that i had booked the staff helped everyone choose suitable dishes and the bbq in the table was a good bit of entertainment the overall bill was very reasonable for central london and by the time we were leaving there was a queue waiting to come in given 4 stars as the wc is tiny and needs a bit of tidying up ,1
visited today before seeing wicked at 2 30pm i read the reviews beforehand and kinda knew it was going to be busy we arrived around 1pm and it was packed but to be fair we only had to sit and wait for around 10 minutes we was not disappointed the guys were busy yet welcoming and friendly we went for the 18 50 set menu the vegetable dumplings to start with were little parcels or tastiness our main was chicken bulgogi served with rice and side of lettuce leafs the guy explained we had to use the lettuce leaf like a wrap and add the chicken etc this was a great experience the tastes were gorgeous we had a couple of extras fried chicken wings and katsu chicken both equally as tasty we would not hesitate to recommend and revisit lime orange thoroughly enjoyed it here ,1
used to be a fantastic place for korean food but except for the bibimbop has really gone down the japchae glass noodle salad as well as some of the other staples no longer stand out but still a good place for the various bibimbops ,1
this resto is small we had no reservation which is not a problem could seat immediately we had the bibimbap and bulgogi both were very nice the chopsticks are not the typical korean s but more chinese so easier for non experts to handle staff is friendly food comes swift come in early because there is a queue building up waiting patiently for food ,1
we stopped here for a dinner and had a plain bapbimbot and a hot bapbimbot both were very good i added and order of kimchi which was just tight actually put most in my dinner service was good and prices were right ,1
very good korean food at a fair price often busy in the evenings a good atmosphere and smiling service recommend the bibimbap and bulgogi both delicious and fresh ,1
checked the opening hours before going and on the website it said 10 30pm arrived at 9 55 on a tuesday and they only offered to serve me for take away i had been wanting to come to this place for a while but surely won t be coming back due to the appalling service if the closing hour is really 10 00pm they need to update their website either that or the waiters were in a rush and wanted to go home early ,0
we didn t had a reservation but this was no problem fast waiters good staters but the bibimbap was really really good the price unbeaten for this part of london unfortunatly we didn t had enough space left for a desert but i m sure they would be good aswell ,1
we were a couple that stopped by after reading some good reviews on tripadvisor and were given a table in the otherwise full restaurant straight away around 19 00 on a weekday we both had the bibimbap after asking for recommendations from the waiter which he carefully explained along with some other items on the menu that we had never heard of once the food arrived we were instructed what it was and how you are supposed to eat it overall the food was both tasty and inexpensive and the service was very good we ll definitely make a visit during our next stay in london ,1
small family run restsurant with great korean food friendly service fair price a taste of korea locatrd near victoria station definitely would go back ,1
saw lime orange on ti with great reviews once again i must agree with my fellow ti reviewers having lived in korea of and on for 12 years this is a good korean restaurant they would do well in korea they do not serve all the side dishes like you would find in the kunsan region but that aside it is good korean food we had the bi bin with beef and one with seafood the place is smallish by england standards maybe seating 50 to 60 people we walked in and there were two tables open for two people each from 1900 to 2000 thursday we saw they had to turn away a dozen people very popular ,1
had dinner with some friends on a saturday evening didn t have to wait for a table at 19 00 we ordered a few dishes and the food was perfectly fine i just didn t feel any of the food was really great given the other reviews i ordered the kimchi jjigae but found it to be a little too watery more like a soup than a stew staff were attentive and overall it was a fair experience i would also say the place is quite small and the seating on the wall was a little uncomfortable two starters a side dish and three mains with drinks for three people came to around 60,0
it s within walking distance from victoria coach station so we tried it see menu the staff was very friendly and food tasted great recommend pork bulgogi downside you have to buy rice separately water is free but no refills service was quick menu made it clear prices include tax and tip overall good dining experience ,1
my wife and i had tickets to see wicked as part of our first wedding anniversary and wanted somewhere local to the theatre to enjoy a pre show dinner i took a chance on google to suggest venues and lime orange came up as one of the top recommendations so off we went it was exactly the right choice the service was quick and very efficient despite it being very busy almost full the food was absolutely superb i chose the spicy chilli prawns for a starter my wife the tofu salad the prawns were huge and incredibly well done the sauce perfect my wife s salad was exactly the same simple but excellent for mains i had the katsu chicken curry my wife the tofu bibimbap again both were simply perfect however beyond the food there was one thing that makes us give this restaurant the 5 it deserves we arrived with enough time to eat before curtain up however each set of diners who arrived after us were asked if they were going to the theatre as time closed on curtain up each new customer was advised of how long each sitting might take and that they may not make curtain up this restaurant was willing to lose covers to allow them to get to the show on time that s a very unselfish and utterly professional decision that favours the customer my wife and i will go back for the food alone and will definitely recommend it to anyone wanting sensibly priced beautifully cooked food excellent service and an eye for customer service second to none go visit ,1
me and my friend came for dinner on a weekday we arrived at 7pm and all the tables were full luckily we had a 15 minute wait the food was delicious and the staff were very attentive i would definitely recommend anyone to go here for a meal the price of the food is relatively cheap as well i m definitely going to make a return visit ,1
wow such a great meal there was a bit of a line for a thursday i waited for about 20 minutes but the food totally made up for it i had the chicken katsu udon which is a delicious fried chicken with a sweet sauce and some very tasty noodles with vegetables and the soy chicken which was great as well all waiters are very nice although very busy as the place is packed i highly recommend this place just be patient if there s a line try to come around 8 30 or 9 as the place is less busy and enjoy the food ,1
we visited for dinner and felt welcome and staff were so friendly we were served food very quickly within 10 minutes or so after ordering dishes we ordered bibimbap beef bbq rice kimchee but beef was thick and dried seems not marinated enough and so it was different from what i expected when we got a bill we found that they added service fee and i was surprised as casual restaurant like this normally do not add it was disappointing that food quality staff service restaurant concept seem not matching even though staff service was wonderful ,1
don t expect swanky tables and crystal glasses but do expect excellent korean food with a realty good menu choice we only stopped for a quick lunch the place was really busy but the service was good and the food arrived quickly i would love to visit again for dinner so i can try some other dishes would definitely recommend and it is good value for money ,1
a few veggie and vegan options but great value and a really cool atmosphere quite a small place but still really good,1
i ve never felt so unwelcome at any restaurant in my life in 5 minutes it became apparent the money grabbing philosophy in which they work so i didn t even get to sit down first of when i arrived a party of 4 arrived behind me the waiter didn t even look at me and got them a table first i attempted to speak out but neither waiter or customers were bothered but the worse part came next when i finally got some attention i asked for a table for 1 the waiter said at the moment they only had the counter which is just next to the door as this was the windiest and rainiest day of the last month i said i d prefer not to i wanted a small table this was flat out refused when i asked why i couldn t get a table the waiter said if a party of 2 comes then they always have priority mind you no one was waiting behind me at this point and i still got told i could only get my table an hour later when for them it was unlikely to be able to fill it up with 2 people such short sighted vision to customer service can only be from team orders and not a one time experience this made me leave straight away with the promise of never returning i m in restaurants all the time because of work and this is the first time anything remotely similar happened to me bad service might not translate directly to bad food in the short run but it will eventually catch up and they will lose their customers unacceptable ,0
we went here for lunch while in london we are fans of asian cuisine it was close to our hotel appeared well recommended we had terrific lunch calamari for appetizer seafood stew for main course with sticky rice total cost 30 quick service nice folks there,1
there are delicious dishes with good prices my daughter i had the bibimbob beef stew that were good its next to the victoria station behind the wicked theater ,1
we all got excited about some good korean barbecue and the menu looks great but our experience wasn t that great first the place is very crowded which by itself is not bad may indicate good food but after waiting a while the get seated we found out that the korean bear was not cold and there were couple of other options that we didn t look or the appetizers were really small and the kimchi was not very pickled but rather mushy and not to much flavor also the barbecue was not crisp and not very well marinated and to top everything we almost got embarrassed at the end when we were told that their card reader wasn t working and that we should go across the street to get some cash ,0
we almost walked straight past lime orange and honestly from the outside it doesn t do much to entice you in however we had heard good things about the place and decided to give it a go and we are so glad we did it is a small restaurant but cosy if a little bit on the warm side the menu offers a good amount of choice but is not at all daunting we started off sharing some soy chicken which were good but a fairly big portion for just one person and the japchae delicious and vegetable mandu brilliant the pork bulgogi was incredibly good possibly the best i have had it was all presented well you mix up the meat and rice with the sauce and stuff it into the lettuce leaves which makes for a filling tasty meal the service was slightly on the slow side but the food was all so good and the waiter was helpful so we didn t really mind a bit of a wait this will definitely become one of our regular haunts and we look forward to coming back again ,1
this restaurant is small in terms of the space internally but the food was very nicely seasoned and the price was friendly in the pocket we love the kim chi chigee the preserved cabbage soup as it came with rice the chapchae was ok and the bugolgi both beef and the chicken i personally enjoyed the beef better the only thing is that it looks like there were only one or two waitress waiter there to serve so when it is busy over lunchtime you do have to have a little patient ,1
love lime orange there are good choice of korean food which taste very very good and reminds me my trip to soul plus food dishes are at reasonable prices and portions are in good size recommend to try bibimbap book a table for a dinner while i didn t get a place without booking or need to wait ,1
delicious had beef bibimbap and kimchi soup it was flavorful the place is really closed to victoria train station ,1
lime orange always come here with my colleagues after our long day at work excellent service from staff food is very tasty yummy price is cheaper than other korean restaurant in london their bbq bibimbap plum tea is a must try,1
i discovered this place last year as part of my family s increasing love for korean cooking i have been here some five times over the last several months each time i ready myself for a disappointment saying to myself that it can t always be this good but it is this time my wife and i each had a bulgagi pork and spicy chicken both were exceptional spicy flavourful and a joy in every mouthful will definitely return soon ,1
had a pre theatre dinner here with my wife mother and the food was outstanding first taste of korean food and i ve left wanting more i ll definitely be a return customer to start we had spicy calamari spicy prawns and vegetable dumplings mains were chicken bibimbap chicken katsu udon and beef bulgogi with green tea black sesame ice cream to finish all dishes packed full of flavour and customers with large smiles upon their faces a great meal for a respectable price a must if you re visiting victoria or the theatre ,1
i arranged to meet some friends while i was visiting london they had to come in on the train so i was simply was trawling tripadvisor searching for a nice restaurant near victoria where we could meet up and lime orange popped up the reviews were great and everyone was happy to give it a go and how glad we were that we did the food is delicious and plentiful the staff are friendly and can give you really good advice about the menu i can t recommend the bibimbap enough and the bill was also a pleasant surprise because we d ordered a lot go there you won t be disappointed ,1
really good food at reasonable prices efficient and friendly service and decent sized portions would definitely go there again,1
stumbled upon this place near victoria station friendly staff delicious food cute restaurant bibimbap was perfectly crispy vegetarian friendly,1
i do not have a bad word to say about this it reminds me of being in asia and the experience and food is quite like it i don t have a bad word to say about this place and i would eat here everyday it would be good if they did a few cheap options i suppose but i still go here often ,1
they serve really good food for reasonable prices but this place is really small the staff are really nice though even if they are busy they will not hesitate to offer you their service ,1
the food was very good and environment cosy and casual full of koreans and japanese so that that says it all cost 30 per head with 2 starter 2 main dishes and bottle of wine,1
good korean food with reasonable pricing can be quite crowded during eating times so be there slightly early fast serving be sure to try it before watch wicked opposite at victoria,1
what can i say great delicious food great service comfortable relaxed atmosphere reasonably priced only downside i can see is that this restaurant only takes cash,1
lovely food small resto but very efficient and the food is gorgeous simple but amazing taste vegan option although most are meat based ,1
the food was delicious and quick service was very good it was crowded so a bit warm in the restaurant so we were in and out quick but everyone enjoyed their meal very tasty ,1
went to this based on tripadvisor reviews and it did not disappoint had the chicken bulgogi and chicken bimibap service was friendly and helpful with recommendations convenient to victoria station tube station ,1
we arrived few minutes after 22 they didn t allowed us in because kitchen closed at 22 we begged to enter because e were arriving from a six hour flight delay and we said anything to eat even cold dishes would be fine no way too late to be kind ,0
great to find this place amidst all of the identikit chains in this area its easy to miss and almost looks as if its closed from outside once you get in however its coolly decorated with really good reasonably priced food and friendly service excellent bibimbap definitely recommended ,1
great little korean restaurant offering absolutely authentic dishes at very affordable rates good service ,1
even from outside the place look very small not so much attracting the food is really tasty the best korean food i ever had bibimbap bulgogi kimchi were delicious staff very friendly i definitely suggest it if you want to taste real korean food ,1
i stopped in here with a friend for a post work catch up by total chance and it was the best surprise ever food was incredibly fresh and delicious and staff super friendly all reasonably priced too for so central will definitely be back ,1
from the outside it is unassuming and looks rather small inside i had one of the best korean foods i have had in a long time and it didn t cost an arm and a leg alot of people here are making complaints or whining about the price portion giving them unfair comparisons to some place they tried on the other side of the world for london it stands out as great value for money and generous portions with quality to match my particular favourite was dukbokgi and we had a bbq ed our meat at the table and the service helped out with this as well by making sure the meat was cooked properly i do recommend you book in advance it s small and cosy but also popular ,1
beautifully prepared food that is excellent value waiting staff are also extremely friendly keep up the good work ,1
met a friend here for lunch it was packed by 12 30 but we were lucky and got a spot food is reasonably priced we both adore korean food but both agreed it was average much better bbq in hawaii would return though and try more dishes ,1
food was good nice taste portion was a little small i wanted more to eat took a while before we got our bill its pretty much opposite wicked price was ok i had bibimbap which was was yummy small restaurant,1
met up with old friends and decided to visit here based on tripadvisor reviews it was very busy and we were sat right next to the front door despite having booked a table in advance personally it was bad positioning as it was bitterly cold and every time someone came and went the cold air rushed in and it was not pleasant service was good food was good but i just feel it is a very tiny restaurant and there are too many tables crammed in and it makes getting comfortable and enjoying your meal not a great experience i don t like the next table practically sitting in my lap when eating but of course this is a personal thing and other folk may not mind this for me it was a little bit like sardines in a tin but as i say food good as was service don t think i would go back for a 2nd visit unless restaurant was quieter ,0
went for a pre theatre bite to eat would recommend great service good food and pleasant environment had the korean bbq two adults and 2 kids 10 13 all enjoyed,1
a friend and i were looking for somewhere to eat near victoria and after reading all the reviews about how good the food was here decided to give it a go to be honest i found the flavours quite bland and despite ordering the spiciest meal on the menu then adding chilli sauce still didn t find it spicy the staff were quite slow there was a considerable break between finishing our meal and having the table cleared no one ever asked if we wanted another drink or dessert just didn t seem very attentive the food was ok and reasonably priced just didn t live up to the expectations i had after the reviews on here saying that the cucumber kimchee was nice so if you do give it a try i would recommend that ,1
a last minute find and what a find after reading the tripadvisor reviews saying it was very busy as soon as it opens i thought it must be good me and my sister arrived about 5 45 and it was already busy but we got a table straightaway this was my first korean meal and the food was amazing and very filling for starter we had bolgogi salad lovely tender strips of beef japchae a wonderful plate of glass noodles pa jeon mini egg pancakes filled with spring onions with vinegar dip for main beef bibimbap basically a big hot pot of rice meat and veg very very yummy and chicken bolgogi which came with rice and lettuce and a bowl of miso 50 with tea the food was wonderful and the service friendly fast and attentive definitely try this place,1
great food excellent and friendly service cannot find anything wrong with this place would highly recommend it ,1
i ve lived in korea and have a korean husband and am totally in love with this restaurant the food is authentic delicious and generously portioned the bibimbap tofu kimchi and yangnyeom chicken are must tries having eaten a lot of korean food not only do i love the authenticity of the menu but i also find it a great way to introduce korean food to people who haven t tried it before the menu is simple but concise with delicious options to cater for the less adventurous with regards to spice and ingredients whilst they build up their confidence i have converted many friends and family members to korean food at lime orange in addition to the food the service at this family run restaurant is second to none friendly warm and welcoming making it a great place to hang out ,1
ordered an uber take away chicken bibimbap and kimchi delicious but no forks o o just imagine you re hungry you just got a warm meal but you cannot touch it bit disappointing ,0
a fabulous meal in very friendly restaurant the choice on all courses was vast and cooked to perfection,1
we searched for a korean restaurant in london and this one appeared planned to go out for the 14th not specifically for valentine s but booked just in case and it was constantly busy it s opposite the apollo and easy to find from victoria sunny was very attentive and looked after everyone we chose set meal which was too much might have been better to order off menu as we had too much but enjoyed sunny was very accommodating and didn t stick to set menu and when we mentioned food was over salted he didn t quibble but came to say sorry and admitted it may have been too much and reduced bill which was very nice of him really enjoyed our experience and great start to an evening in london and we re ready for a night of laughs at a comedy club ,1
despite being way busier than last time i visited it didn t disappoint beautiful food all round even though dining alone i had to wait veg mandu kimchee and beef bibimbap all gorgeous highly recommended except please don t go when i want to get in ,1
really delicious korean food especially the pajeon it s a must order dish definitely 1 of the nicest pajeon that i ve tasted many diners around us were having jjamppong so i ordered it as well really nice and spicy soup base it warms the stomach and body during cold weather but i would prefer to have thinner noodles compared to the udon noodle they used nevertheless it s still a great bowl of noodle the sweet rice drink tasted great as well i ll definitely return for more if i travel to london again ,1
small busy and live korean restaurant i ve been 3 times and the food is always good the prices are very reasonable too give the place a try and you won t be disappointed,1
i have to say korean food has become one of my favourite cuisines the depth of flavour is to die for if you haven t tried korean food before you definitely should like very soon ,1
we went for lunch here before a trip to the theatre it is quite a small place but we were able to be seated right away the menu has the usual korean favourites and the sizzling bibimbap dishes in particular looked very good we had the bulgolgi beef and yukgae jang with dukbokgi as a starter which wasn t too spicy and it was all high quality our waiter was friendly and would helpfully explain to customers the usual way of eating particular dishes ,1
when we discovered this local family run korean place 2 years ago it immediately became a big hit with our office multiple trips per week to begin with and then settling at a consistent weekly or fortnightly visit ever since i would bring friends family here when visiting the city for the weekend and advocate people go out of their way even to seek it out their yangyeum chicken starter was to die for their bibimbaps tasy and their pork bulgogi especially good unfortunately my regular lunch pal and i have noticed a steady decline in portion size and food quality over the last 6 months or so alongside a slow rise in prices we have often remarked before while dining here how pleased we are that this brilliant little friendly restaurant had not succumbed to the trend only too often seen at local establishments that gain popularity that temptation to try to further increase profit margins by switching to cheaper cuts of meat changing suppliers and suffering a noticeable dip in quality and getting stingy with portions unfortunately this has now happened first our beloved yangyeum chicken previously so good that we had visited and ordered only two portions of this delicious starter each as our meals was switched from a generous pile of easy to eat boneless chicken thigh i d guess to chicken wings instead without any change to the menu i should add next the generous portion was downsized to just 5 wings tested on multiple occasions for consistency and finally the price was actually increased now many people very much enjoy chicken wings so what s wrong with that you might ask well for the tourists who might wander in once on their visit to see buckingham palace absolutely nothing but for those living or working locally we know better we know what came before and i ll tell you this for nothing bitesize pieces of dark meat are far easier to eat cleanly with chopsticks while on an office lunch break or having a business meeting than fiddly little battered wings smothered in a very sticky spicy sweet sauce we ve also observed a decrease in the bibimbap sizes smaller portions of accompaniments increased greasiness and lower quality of meats e g the belly pork and further subtle price increases across the menu i think we feel particularly strongly just because of how much love we had for this place initially and what a stark contrast there is the first time we went after they d made the thigh to wing switch the waiting staff actually apologized to us for the change when we ordered knowing full well we d be disappointed now they simply look at us apologetically when we arrive in the doorway sadly while we ve really been trying to keep coming our regular visits may now have come to an end the decline has crossed a threshold like many of the best things in life it seems it couldn t last forever tl dr if you re in town for the weekend fancy some korean and are in the area you could do far worse than lime orange if however you ve been before and loved it say a year ago or so don t come back you ll be sorely disappointed D,0
visited with friends and was blown away from the quality of the food and the explosion of flavours i wasn t expecting much when my friend took me there but was so glad he did the bibimbap i had included 7 vegetables and beef vegan options available my friend had the spicy pork ribs which were great too prices are on the cheap side considering its in victoria which is a huge plus would definitely recommend ,1
this is a lovely place for the most wonderful service the food is good clean and flavoursome which is remarkablein this day and age the food is really preety and tasty the staffsare very friendly ,1
we ate at lime orange to celebrate the end of a project we all thoroughly enjoyed the food i had dukbokgi followed by pork bibimbap my colleagues had calamari and beef bulgogi salad followed by beef bulgogi and pork bibimbap service was friendly and rapid and there was a real energy in the restaurant if we hadn t booked we wouldn t have got a table food was fresh and well spiced and portions were very generous it s a little while since i ve been here but i ll definitely be back ,1
first time here and i will definitely go back if i am in the area the food was really nice really tasty and not expensive at all considering it is london good quality and quick service it is a very small place that you may miss walking around but it is definitely worth it plenty of dishes for vegetarians too ,1
i went there with my friends and we had bug in our food the manager refused to compensate us only provided free food but we couldn t eat it anymore totally unacceptable ,1
had a really nice meal but the stand out was the service really attentive and friendly my meal didn t taste that different to a chinese except for the lettuce but it was good,1
i have limited experience with korean food so i was looking for somewhere i could experiment without breaking the bank lime orange was a great place to have a weekday lunch and try a couple of dishes it s a small popular restaurant with friendly staff who wil give you a steer if you need it a great place to eat if you live or work nearby but not a destination restaurant ,1
tried this restaurant as keen to sample korean food and was not disappointed yes the venue is small but the service was attentive and friendly and the food was delicious really enjoyed the food we ordered and the service was attentive and friendly would recommend booking a table ,1
a small un assuming caf√© alongside victoria station but at 1215 completely full and buzzing we tried their two course set meal includes a glass of wine during cup of green tea and enjoyed the experience it was served very quickly really tasty and hot and slightly spicy just what we needed on a cold morning worth a visit ,1
just a minute walk from victoria station it was very convenience we did have lunch at there reached there at 1 15 pm but you should have to wait as i thought that it was very tiny food quality was good but price was bit more as well ,1
i just ordered through deliveroo a kimchee bibimbap extra crispy seaweed and a beer i was having a night in live very close to the restaurant and it arrived cold the rice was so luke warm it was pretty much cold for a restaurant that boasts of large portions the quantity of food was very small for the amount i paid the food was not remotely satisfying enough nor delicious and for the portion it was expensive the beer was not even cold enough sorry lime orange this is not good enough even delivery to a close destination must be to a high standard,0
little tiny restaurant with max 15 tables was waited around 40 mins however the food was quite nice all the ingredients are from korean supermarket love the beer here nice place to hang out with friend ,1
a little korean restaurant 3 mins walk from victoria station opposite wicked the theatre show tucked away next to russell hotel looks nothing special but the food was sooooo good soft drink starter main was 15 including tip they do a set menu for 18 50 including a glass of wine my friend had the katsu curry with udon noodles i had the tofu soup would go back tomorrow haven t ever had korean before but it was busy bustling you can book but only over the phone not on the day we walked in we had to pay cash as the machine wasn t working but all good a little secret gem of you are near victoria station,1
i d never had korean food before so i tried the katsu curry which i ve had at japanese restaurants really enjoyed so i had a basis for comparison it was very different but equally tasty coming with noodles instead of rice and a much tarter and thinner sauce the green tea ice cream was also very nice service a little slow although if you intend to make a whole evening of it then that s not really a problem small restaurant i d advise booking as it s clearly popular at the weekends i d go again ,0
we tried the bibimbap one beef and one pork and we enjoyed it very much i liked the aloe vera drink the ice cream was excellent as well good price quality ratio ,1
this was my first ever korean food experience so i cant really compare but i think the food was pretty good i especially liked the calamari in the sweet chilli sauce but all other dishes were nice too nice and cosy atmosphere and quick service if you have a chance to call in advance i would recommend to make a reservation as the place is really tinny and busy ,1
came across this little wonder while waiting for wicked didn t really expect much but wow awesome great food and atmosphere one family of 4 with full bellies resonabley priced for london great going guys,1
lovely cosy and lively atmosphere on a chilly winters saturday delicious food good portion sizes and affordable prices ticks all round had to wait quite a while for the food but understandable as they we busy and it was piping hot and well wroth the wait when it arrived i ll be back ,1
for the first time trying korean this restaurant gives you a good flavour the menu isn t vast but it s great for a quick flavoursome lunch or dinner i d recommend the traditional dish as the main simple and good food ,1
tiny restaurant with an extensive menu food was delicious though i would recommending reserving and the restaurant doesn t take cards cash only ,1
as a korean eating virgin this was a new one on me and chosen primarily as a lunch venue because of its proximity to victoria station the reason for lunch was a quarterly meeting with an ex client who has become a friend and we enjoyed the experience the service was excellent after we explained our inexperience but found it difficult to eat our pork belly in lettuce parcels with rice so reverted to normal eating practices the restaurant was busy and the clientele interesting although the tables were very close together making it feel like a cafe more than a restaurant that meant i marked it down from a four start to a three star experience this is an excellent place to eat decent food when travelling to and from victoria station especially because of the other execrable restaurants in the area but probably not worth travelling too far for ,1
great korean food super nice service i will definitely return to lime orange on my next trip to london,1
having never eaten korean food before we were novices but we were blown away by the food here the beef bibimbap and pork barbecue were both exceptional with loads of great flavour and freshness this is a small simple restaurant but is very friendly and serves a lovely pale korean lager we will look forward to returning ,1
we arrived at 7 30pm for a meal and were told that there would be a short wait as we had not made a booking we were seated after 10minutes and ordered pork and beef mains with the extra lettuce and rice the food was very good and a really good price for london would recommend to friends ,1
had a quick dinner there before watching a play and must say that their service is fast food was good and pricing was very reasonable by london standards ,1
called to make a booking but they dont take them on the day decided to arrive for dinner just before 6pm and snagged the last table service was great and friendly and the prawn and calamari starters where excellent ordered beef and pork mains with all the trimmings lettuce rice and spicy sauces so much amazing food couldnt help but finish it all even if we were about to pop ,1
we have ordered take away on saturday night with my favourite korean dishes i love udon noodles with catsu chicken and yam yam chicken yam yam chicken are chicken pieces cooked or fried in sweet chilli sauce and what i got was not yam yam chicken it was just chieckn wings in some sweet sticky sauce the same with udon noodles they were really oily and just avarage i got to kim chee they do the best korean food i was hoping that maybe i find resturant closer to me but unfortunately was left disappointed i will not order or go to this restaurant again ,0
we booked for lunch on a saturday because of the good trip advisor reviews and because it was near where we were going to be at lunch time not being familiar with korean food we opted for a set meal the staff were welcoming and thoughtful offering a fork instead of chop sticks judging by the dominance of non english conversations and eastern eyes we thought this must definitely be authentic food ,1
great little find opposite the apollo theatre victoria serving good korean food popular dishes such as kimchee and bibimbap are on the menu you also have the option of grilling your your own meat a meal for three of us including drinks cost us 80 great value for money highly recommended ,1
was in the area for work and didn t fancy boring sandwiches or sushi that most of the places around offer with the help of the internet found this place and made my 15 minute way there which totally worth it when i came the place was quite empty i was welcomed by very friendly waiter and sat next to the window in a few minutes all spaces were taken and the place was buzzing but the only waiter was speedy nice and paying everyone equal attention i am a huge fan of korean food growing up in the country with lots of korean expats so i browsed through the menu and appreciated the selection i haven t had bibimbap in ages so opted for it with extra kimchi when it has arrived all bright and colourful on the sizzling hot plate along with some miso on the side and hot sauce i thought it was too beautiful to eat at the end the dish ended up being glorious with all ingredients fresh and flavourful definitely recommend the also have a lunch special that is different every day which i think is a great value will repeat my visit next time i am around the area ,1
the korean bbq is very good and the bibimbap is also very good the restuarant owner is very kind all the staff there are korean so you will have a feeling that this is what real korean restuarant should be ,1
5 of us ate here on a saturday night it was very busy but they managed to honour our reservation and squeeze us in most of us were new to korean food and they gave us suggestions which we really enjoyed very good value and friendly service i work hear here sometimes so will be recommending to colleagues we come back here some time ,1
stumbled upon this place by accident it s directly behind the apollo victoria theatre we had no idea as never tried korean food before but we were looked after by thao who guided us through the menu and made recommendations food and service fantastic i would recommend the calamari with sweet chilli sauce we shared a starter main and seaweed with a round of drinks and two soups it came to 29,1
a small restaurant across from a theatre near victoria station beeng a tourist we were out and avout and decided to eat just after it opened at 5 we got the second to last table and people were constantly comming in well i know why the food was fantastic at a reasonable price piping hot and not slow the waiter and waitress were run off their feet and pleasant at all times great food great service great price,1
fab place great food and definitely worth a visit be sure to book a table every single chair was occupied when i was there ,1
this little restaurant doesn t look like anything special from the outside but inside it s full and serving delicious korean food a perfect place for a quick meal but also a perfect place for a meal with friends over a bbq table we had such a fantastic meal here last night the bbq pork is unbelievably good eat with lettuce and sauce the last place i can compare this to was a great korean in new york this place is authentic and very busy as it s so popular go you won t be let down ,1
i always get sudden cravings for asian food when overseas and luckily lime orange was not far from where i was staying i had found this little gem through google suggestions by checking what asian restaurants were nearby and decided to give this place a try based on the impressive 4 star reviews the first time i visited lime orange i got dinner take out the restaurant was packed on a weekday night and once i walked in the food smelled authentic and right i got the beef bibimbap mixed rice bowl and it was delicious i had gone back several times afterwards and also tried dining at the restaurant other dishes i enjoyed were the japchae glass noodle stir fry dukbokgi rice cake in spicy sauce pa jeon seafood pancake and tofu soup just a gentle reminder that for those dining in try and avoid wearing knits because the restaurant does have bbq and grill options and the smell can stick to your clothes service is friendly and prices are reasonable they do take rsvps except between 6 15pm and 7 30pm it is located just walking distance from victoria station and opposite the apollo victoria theatre ,1
i really like this place and come here quite often for my lunch friday lunch special spicy chicken is really good and it only costs 3 99 cheaper than pret sandwich monday special is good too and bimbimbaps are nice too ,1
doesn t look much from the outside but the food is a wonderful example of japanese cuisine the people are friendly and helpful the service is quick but unhurried and the food id delicious and reasonably well priced however be warned it is advisable to book a a table i did because even though i was there at 5 30pm by six it was full and when i left at 6 45 they were queuing outside its right opposite victoria station so convenient for the train and the local theatre where wicked is currently playing i strongly recommend this restaurant and i feel sure you won t be disappointed,1
lovely little gem in london which cannot be recommended highly enough the bibimbap which we d never had before was absolutely incredible served extremely hot temperature not spice and such a nice change it was reasonably priced the servers were lovely and they managed to squeeze us in without booking at a busy time although i would recommend booking as it is a relatively small place ,1
 75 for two people was a bit pricey for a light lunch food good but not stunning pancakes a bit soggy and oily sake was the cheapest and a bit like fire water but i still drank it pick carefully and you will have a great meal ,0
having never had korean food we ordered from the set menu which was very reasonably priced and included a glass of wine and korean tea the food was delicious and not too spicy the dumplings in particular were lovely the waiter was extremely helpful in advising us what to order the best way to eat the food and he worked really hard in a busy restaurant a large number of the customers were korean which i think speaks for itself definitely worth a visit ,1
after reading trip adviser reviews thought to try this at lunch and would recommend delicious food and friendly and quick service and authentic given the number of locals who ate there too ,1
you know this is a good korean restaurant when a lot of the customers are koreans great for couples or family although a small restaurant the selection of food is not massive to me this is a good sign that they do well with what they offer and let me tell you the food is absolutely fantastic highly recommended ,1
having never tried korean food i was a bit worried it might be too spicy but the food was delicious had the mild chicken to start and beef for main there was plenty food the service maybe a bit too quick as we hadn t quite finished our starters when mains arrived overall good value for money and would go again if in the area ,1
this little restaurant serves absolutely delicious food give this place a go if you have never tried korean food before i had vegetable dumplings beef bulgogi a korean beer and my partner had spicy prawns spicy chicken bulgogi and japenese beer absolutely everything we had came out piping hot and very flavoursome we went for pre theatre dinner and were not disappointed thank you lime orange ,1
for a midweek meal out with two friends it was perfect all three of us asked the question of when we had last eaten anything so delicious no satisfactory answers were provided the price was very reasonable for the quality of the food the atmosphere was relaxed and the food came out very in an extremely timely manner the staff were faultless top notch very happy ,1
we ordered set menu one one chicken bulgogi and one pork which proved to be very flavoursome would definitely recommend for a nice meal out,1
i work in victoria and its quite hard to find a good place to eat i was impressed with the speedy service price portion size but most importantly the taste and flavour of the food was spot on they have a great daily lunch menu where you can eat in for 4 99 or take away for 3 99 it s a small restaurant so do book ahead if you are going in large numbers only downfall was that i wanted my bibimbap fix but they ran out of rice i ended up ordering yukgaejang soup and they offered noodles as an alternative and it was lovely never tried that before and now its something i would have again happy that i tried this restaurant and will be going back again ,1
excellent food waiter very knowledgable and advised on what to have service fast and food piping hot lovely to experience his type of cuisine over the road from the theatre to see wicked really worth a try ,1
i ordered salmon teriyaki 13 50 and all that i had was 1 piece of realy thin salmon ridicously greasy with at leats 150g of beansprouts my friend has noodles with no sauce and with 3 pieces of greasy chicken for 11 50 absolutely horrible do not order take away,0
close to apollo victoria made good sense for pre theatre dinner the staff were friendly and efficient helped with the order as we never eat korean before the food was good not too spicy very tasty and flavoursome place was busy tables were close but didn t seem as crowded at some of the other posts suggest certainly recommended,1
the portions were hearty for the price we paid the waiter was lovely and was always smiling we ordered starter and mains and it was the typical korean dishes would come here again ,1
good service good food simple menu i ordered what is best described as a sizzling bowl of rice pork and vegetables squeeze in a load of chilli sauce and mix it all together tasted great my only criticism is that whilst the atmosphere was vibrant it s one of those places when you re sat almost touching the person on the next table very noisy busy and hot ,0
if you fancy something a bit different for lunch this place is great would advise to book as it was very busy great service great food settings very basic but don t let it put you off ,1
my only negative comment restaurant was a bit tired looking but service was incredibly friendly and prompt atmosphere was good and the food was amazing brought to the table very quickly on sizzling hot plates for a very reasonable price will definitely return if we re in this part of london again ,1
it was my very first time in a korean restaurant with real korean food served since i love korea and know some of their dishes i tried the kimchee spicy calamari and a bibimbap dishes everything was very good i was soooo full at the end there was even space for some soju which was great very nice place near victoria station to enjoy this type of food kind and nice waiter and waitress that made it more enjoyable i will surely return ,1
my first korean meal and i very much enjoyed it our party had a selection of reasonably priced tofu beef and chicken dishes piping hot though unusually the side portion of spinach is served at fridge temperature some unusual drink options for the adventurous the place was full on weekday lunchtime good idea to book friendly service ,1
i was grabbing a quick meal before catching a train so ordered two starters i was disappointed in the bolgogi beef salad as the beef was served cold and the salad itself was overdressed the glass noodle salad with the same bolgogi beef but served hot was so much more pleasant other koreans do serve their salads with heated beef and it helps the flavour really come out nicely not particularly a warm experience no real welcome or send off but i would pop back in if i was craving asian near wicked or the victoria station and in a hurry ,0
an interesting place even if i am not particularly keen of plain simple corean food yet the starters are very good specially the dumplings and fish pancake ,0
i was so hungry at the time when i went but luckily the salmon i ordered was big and delicious the waiter was friendly and the food was served fast would definitely return but bad news is that the queue is always quite long ,1
good food good price but we had the impression they want us to leave soon as there was a queue otherwise i enjoyed ,1
so pleased with my dinner waiter was so nice about explain the dishes for me and solved my garlic issue i choose a chicken noddle without garlic that turn out amazing ,1
small place seated about 30 i guess just next to victoria station it s a small korean food place narrow room with tables down one side so atmosphere is limited but don t let that put you off as the food really is top notch and very reasonably priced the chicken starter we had was served pipping hot and very tasty the main was served with obvious fresh vegetables and again tasty fresh and hot the prices were good starters from 4 8 quid and mains from around 9 quid upward sides a couple of quid service was quick friendly and efficient a meal for two with starters mains and a beer was basically 50 quid not bad for central london in summary food quality superb taste very service quick and efficient value not bad fair prices hope this helps ,1
fantastic helpful friendly staff food perfect wine nice and sensibly priced wish we found before will be back,1
lovely little restaurant with delicious food reasonable pricing and pleasant staff easy walking distance from victoria station thursday evening it was buzzing white wine needs to be chilled more the main courses arrived shortly after the starters so a little erratic it s a noisy restaurant when full ,1
close to victoria station this little outlet serves fresh and authentic korean fare not a very extensive menu but adequate sampling of all the old favorites their bulgogi and bimbimbap are both excellent and the portions more than adequte fairly quick service with a smile and helpful staff would go again,1
i used trip advisor to find a restaurant suitable for a theatre dinner lime orange seemed a good choice and we were delighted with this tiny place i would never have entered the restaurant had it been by looks alone as the exterior is not very inviting but once inside the door the room was clean quite smart and we were shown to our table by a very polite and friendly waiter we got a table at 5 30 with ease and soon after the tiny restaurant quickly filled up we were given advice about food choices the bbq chicken was delicious and sizzlingly hot and the pork bibimbap was equally good although we ordered rice with the chicken we didn t need it as we shared both dishes and there was plenty for two ladies the service was very quick and friendly as they are very used to people going to the apollo victoria theatre which is immediately across the road ignore google maps advice as that will direct you to the back entrance ,1
the exterior of this korean fusion restaurant is rather uninspiring do not be put off by this we had read reviews online so knew it had a good reputation we were not disappointed from the moment we met our charming host and were led to our table and through the variety of dishes we felt relaxed and welcome the food was delicious we shared a dish of kimchi followed by hot stone pot biminbap and a spicy chicken bulgogi with fresh lettuce on the side we arrived early pre show and did not reserve a table from 18 30 it would be necessary to book as the restaurant filled up rapidly it was a thoroughly enjoyable meal ,1
on the 11th of july 2016 we had tickets to see the wicked theatre show after picking up our tickets at the box office we were looking for a quick but good quality meal before seats opened for the show and a place close to the apollo victoria theatre based on tripadvisor reviews we chose to visit lime orange with a family of four two adults and two daughters one hour before seats open for wicked we ordered fried calamari for starters then bibimbap soup and noodles with fried chicken everything was tasty and stupendous in flavour texture and temperature it was our first experience with korean food but based on this first encounter i m sure more will follow our daughters who at first protested as we were visiting asian again really loved the tasty food service was fast and helpful and accommodating highly recommended ,1
definitely worthy going there it is always busy in fact i went there with 3 girlfriend and we really enjoyed the food the portion are medium small ,1
my first experience of korean food but had my friend and helpful waiter to guide me food was excellent and full of flavour portions generous slightly disconcerted about starters and mains etc arriving all at the same time we went for lunch and place was very busy you can book but only by phone prices are very reasonable and a stones throw from victoria station a great find and will return ,1
the menu consists of the standard fare bulgogi and bibimbap but the preparation and flavors here are spectacular the beef appetizer in particular was scrumptious prices reasonable and service very cheerful seating is typically rustic korean with lots of wood ,1
not only is the food fantastic and delicious but the customer service was above and beyond when my 9 year old couldn t finish her noodles they not only made up a doggy bag but held onto it for us when we went to wicked as we weren t allowed to take it into the theatre so she had the fanciest packed lunch on monday at school double delights we will definitely visit again i loved my bimbimbap dish and the calamari starters were perfecct ,1
i m shocked that i have lived in this area for over 10 years and have only now discovered this wonderful local restaurant it s conveniently located right next to victoria station but unless you are visiting the apollo theatre right opposite or are a commuter taking the bus outside the restaurant it s easy to miss vauxhall bridge road certainly isn t the most scenic road so probably not too many people just going for a stroll in the arae however i can only recommend taking a detour for this little gem all the dishes i have ordered so far have been excellent i particularly liked their japchae every day they have a different special lunch dish and for 3 99 take away or 4 99 eat in it s incredible value for money for london in general but particularly for this area portions are generous it s casual dining at it s best the furnishing may be simple but the ambience feels relaxed and somehow always has a calming effect on me even when the restaurant is packed this may also be thanks to the wonderful staff always very friendly quick and helpful ,1
the restaurant is conveniently located near to victoria station just behind the wicked theatre nice restaurant ambience and great service staff the food was also really good e g the bibimbap the lighting in the restaurant was a bit dim when you look from afar so i was mistaken that it s closed until i take a closer look glad i didn t turn away in the end ,1
food was amazing specially the sweet and sour calamari for starters and the bibimbap selection we also chose to get 3 selections of their grill and bbq my friends and i stayed for for around 3 hours with some tea and desserts afterwards and the staff took care of us the whole time and was very friendly ,1
had a mixed seafood bibimbap and if you havent tried one they should definitely be experienced served with several vegetables and rice in a hot heavy dish mix it all together for a great tasty meal,0
eaten here a few times you can t book before 7 and it does get really busy at this time it s near victoria station so maybe pre theatre and commuters account for this but worth the short wait for a table if necessary food is great value fresh and tasty the staff are very friendly too ,1
i visited here on a tuesday night with two friends and were lucky to get a table as i know it can be busy the wine was good and not too and the food we had was delicious we ordered a mixture of starters and then all had a main and we were stuffed full as the portions are a good size and we couldn t stop eating would definitely come back here the staff were so lovely and didn t rush us once even though we waited a long time for our 3rd party member to join us food came out quickly too a great wee place thanks ,1
it might not be the kind of place to take your bird on a first date but a fantastic place to go for a work lunch food is good some of the best korean food i have eaten in london decent price it can be busy so it may be worth booking ahead if there are a few of you ,1
i was taken here by a friend we shared two starters both were excellent i having never had korean food i was unsure but this put me at ease for mains we had be sizzling bowls of veg with an intact egg yoke mine also had chicken this was filling and interesting but not quite at the same level of yumminess but fully palatable and filling maybe owing to my own eating style by the end the food had blackened to the metal bowl and was less tasty to be fair this was just the dregs so shouldn t put people off the food for desert we had green tea ice cream the taste of this was excellent what was more questionable and i think a marmite option was the texture it had green tea in it so was bitty i am still undecided if i liked it my friend definitely didn t however two colleagues at work both said they love the bits so i guess try and see its only a couple of quid i would come back korean food was tasty filly and fresh ,1
we visited as a group of 4 adults and 4 children and found the service and food to be excellent we didn t book as we turned up when it opened but by around 6 on a thursday night it was very busy not sure if the staff were on different shift patterns but the waiter was extremely busy on his own for the 1st hour which was ok for us as we was the first ones in so no issues with service jap chae glass noodles was a bit small for 6 70 for a starter but it was very flavoursome bimbibap was excellent and very tasty bbq meat was also very good and tasty lighting was a bit dark which meant sometimes it was a little hard to tell if the meat was cooked ,1
i stumbled in the restuarant just by coincidence it was a good suprise great food authentic and the portion are good too it s a bit busy but worth it i recommend it ,1
found this little gem by chance doesn t look like much from the outside but the quality of the food is excellent and prices more than reasonable and their bibimbap is amazing ,1
i was introduced to lime orange korean and japanese restaurant a few months ago and it has now become one of my favourite lunch places the restaurant s ambience is simple but the food is very good home like cooking the staff are very friendly and ready to assist you with your choice of food food is also served quickly which is quite efficient if you only have a one hour lunch break never tried dinner at this place but should also be good above everything the prices are very reasonable recommendable but is usually very busy especially for lunch ,1
good selection of korean and japanese food restaurant gets busy early but worth the wait for a table ,1
tried for the first time today for lunch very friendly service and good tasty tofu bibimbap loved the rice crust at the bottom from the red hit bowl price reasonable and speedy service too will return ,1
my partner have visited lime orange on a number of occasions over the last few years and have always had a great meal the food is fantastic the staff are very friendly and it is good value for money as well i like how the staff are also happy to show you how to eat certain dishes if you are unfamiliar with the cuisine much appreciated the first time i went there ,1
looking for a byte before wicked found this place the service was polite quick and efficient the food special and tasty started with vegi dumplings which were excellent following came a bibimbap that exploded with flavors an ice cream made from black sesame was interesting and completed the meal the whole experience was good and right on time considering the fact that i ve splurged on wicked the cost here was just right ,1
i was the only non korean in here the night i ate which is usually a good sign i had the japchae and it was very good the prices were in keeping with the area ,1
it s far better in korean town the fried rice is terrible without flavor the field chicken is ok but fried too deep therefore hard to bite ,0
good food reasonably priced for london 35 head very small restaurant so best to avoid disappointment by booking service a little slow at times but polite and efficient once food order placed ,0
i ve not eaten any korean food before but read the reviews here so thought i d give it a go as i was off to see wicked which is just across the road i had the beef bibimbap which really tasty watch out it comes in a red hot bowl the house wine wasn t amazing but it was fine enough fab food served in an un pretentious little place it was pretty busy but i was on my own so not too much of a problem if there is a group of you it might be best to book in advance ,1
i went to have dinner here with my family and friends thoroughly enjoyed it was full service was fast and food was warm and tasty ,1
visited before the wicked theatre with the kids and i must say the food was mind blowing i had expected similarity to chinese food but i was very wrong the bibimbap i had was fantastic 8 vegetables with egg yolk and chilli sauce and the fun part was that you had to mix everything in to get the full flavour the staff were very friendly too explaining all the best selling dishes and recommending a few to the kids who had no idea what they wanted overall a very pleasant experience would recommend to friends and family passing by victoria ,1
went here for a work friends leaving do friendly staff help you understand menu if you get stuck i had spicy egg chicken noodles and boy they are hot not for the faint hearted accompaniment of seaweed and cucumber and pear it was lovely aloe vera juice and black sesame ice cream fast service fast food well worth a visit,1
a friend and mine stopped into this place as we were walking around the area just sight seeing looking for a decent priced restaurant that had some spicy options didn t know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised also note that they don t take american express so make sure you have cash or a different credit card ,1
small korean restaurant in victoria service is hectic but efficient and always friendly the food is good and prices are reasonable even unbeatable when it comes to the daily special ,1
welcoming helpful staff nice atmosphere starters of chicken katsu and veggie mari were good as was yummy spinach side both had bibimbap for main which was delicious only quibble would be being served main courses half way through starters was told would stay hot after stirring it was warm only as beef had gone cold would have preferred hot and not like i had to rush my starter as main was already there not great choice of puds but you ll be full by then anyway ,0
this is my favourite korean restaurant so far the dishes are tasty rather than just greasy and spicy and the portion sizes are ok you don t leave hungry the bulgogy is absolutely amazing although it doesn t come cheap at the end of the day as you pay seperately for all the bits but worth it they do lovely drinks as well ,1
we were late because the underground was delayed but the staff couldn t have been nicer and more helpful we had the bipimbap which arrived very quickly and was delicious we thoroughly enjoyed our meal thanks x,1
food was really good and waitstaff really helpful we were shown right way to eat the food as i was not familiar with it bibimbap super delicious ,1
i came to know this restaurant after a series of research in narrowing down the best korean restaurants that fits our criteria including price range location atmosphere etc i was a little sceptical at the beginning as there weren t a lot of reviews on tripadvisor for this place despite the high ratings to be fair lime orange isn t one of the most well known korean restaurants in town but we like how it is one of the few that s close to my friend s hotel at south kensington as most korean restaurants are gathered around tottenham court road holborn area the restaurant itself is very easy to find as it is located on the main road right opposite apollo theatre known as the theatre for wicked the musical price range is also very reasonable and the quality of food is no less than that of the better known korean restaurants such as kimchee the portion of food is also very decent for appetizers we had jap chae a small dish of korean glass noodles it was the best jap chae i had in london vegetable mandu 5 korean dumplings they were very crispy and a small bowl of kimchi it was quite spicy but it would be better if there was more depth in flavour rather than spice alone for main course we had a beef bibimbap a kimchi soup pot which actually gives you a complimentary bowl of rice but it isn t specified on the menu i quite like the pork that comes with it and fried seafood udon i like the flavours and the wide variety of seafood between the four of us we had a really enjoyable meal as it was a nice casual place to dine and chat the only downside for us is that the staff could have been a little bit more attentive by serving water regularly or perhaps just look around more often otherwise everything was perfect in general though the staff there are all very friendly on a final note the bill came down to 40 which was 10 quid pp you definitely get more than you pay ,1
lovely casual korean restaurant always packed and people queuing to get in friendly staff good value for money bimbimbap rice great and large portions also serves green tea ice cream it s very close to victoria station def give this place a try for casual tasty eating ,1
lovely little restaurant serving delicious korean food the bibimbap was fantastic and came with soup too the vegetable dumplings were great too friendly and quick service very convenient for victoria station i m looking forward to returning very soon ,1
we had lunch in the restaurant which is right opposite the entrance to the apollo victoria theatre the surrounds seem a bit basic but the food was tasty and the service excellent dishes are japanese thai korean and the portions are generous i was pleasantly surprised at the cost lunch for 5 people including a bottle of wine and service came to 16 a head which is amazing for central london just the place for a pre theatre lunch ,1
very nice had a salad with cold beef as a starter and a miso soup pot with seafood vegetables and tofu with a bowl of rice as main course tasty very friendly staff decent price recommended ,1
nice meal in a great location the food was presented well and was tasty i had seafood pancakes for my starter it was far too big a portion and would have filled me on its own i did not finish it the starter was tasty but a bit stodgy i did not like the chili sauce they gave us to accompany the meal my main course was a pork dish served with rice and lettuce this was tasty again presentation was good a two course meal for two with one of us having sake and one of us having two bottled beers came in at around 40 for central london that s terrific value the restaurant is quite basic on the inside and the toilets were pretty shocking they looked like they hadn t been cleaned for quite a while and there was a bit of a smell that s my main reason for not giving a 5 star review it s not a posh restaurant but it was tasty filling and service was good recommended if you re on a budget ,1
lime orange is a basic looking restaurant more in a cafe style with a unexciting low level view of vauxhall bridge road but despite that it was just what we had been looking for the service was faultless the food bibimbap etc delicious though the red chili paste was dispensed from what looked like a ketchup tomato bottle and came to about 15 head for lunch would definately recommend ,1
this was our first korean experience it was fantastic our waiter was helpful advised us what to try both my husband i agreed the calamari was the best we ve ever had the black sesame ice cream was out of this world we can t wait to come back ,1
i have come here for lunch many times but haven t got past the three favourites monday daily special chicken katsu and udon noodles wednesday spicy beef soup which is a chili oil flecked consomm√© soup with bean sprouts scallions bits of beef and slices of a mild winter vegetable i drown the accompanying bowl of rice in it both go great with a side order of kim chee the healthy cabbage and chili the total damage then is about 8 20 they do bibimbap very well that works out at around 10 the tofu option was my favourite they also do chicken beef pork or seafood only seafood untested others fine too service is quick and courteous place gets full though best advice is to arrive early like 12 to 12 15 solo diners have a stool and bar looking out of the window option place is near victoria station due to crossrail civil engineering project this area has become a bit of a food desert lime orange is recommended ,1
bibimbap is delicious and the best i ve had portion is huge staff are friendly and food is very good on a previous visit i also had the veggie pancake which is nice too highly recommend,1
went with a large group of friends after the theatre without booking in advance staff were very accommodating and the service was very efficient food was extremely good with a varied korean and japanese menu excellent value will definitely go back ,1
we went here for a pre theatre meal i was impressed by the way they explained what everything was and made really sensible recommendations the service was smooth and attentive and this was a great opportunity to try something new there was a range of different dishes and they were keen to help us choose something that was balanced for our tastes on a future visit i might push myself a little to try something a bit more experimental but i trusted the staffs suggestion to start with something i was more used to i will very definitely return here and i recommend the green tea ice cream ,1
i love oriental food and i have always had great korean food in london this one is absolutely one of the best for food quality and great value ,1
been here twice this month the food was amazing both times the gentleman was extremely helpful and friendly i would highly recommend this restaurant great value for money,1
coming from the provinces we were struck by the sight of young people having an early evening meal in working clothes presumably prior to going home the food is good and the staff helpful in navigating the unusual menu a restaurant deserving of its pleasing reviews ,1
i ve never eaten korean before i m always up for trying different foods i m glad we came here it was recommended by family knowing nothing of korean foods i just let my cousin order traditional dishes i think my chopstick skills didn t show me up either which is a self achievement i was very impressed with the flavours i will certainly eat korean cuisine again if i get the opportunity and wash it down with some korean beer sodu we had a variety of dishes side dishes spicy cabbage 2 different beef dishes and pancakes loved it all ,1
decided to try this place due to previous very good reviews on here and it s proximity to the theatre over the road we were not disappointed although the restaurant is pretty small narrow and pretty busy when we arrived it still felt like we had enough room and could talk without needing to raise our voices over others the service was attentive very polite and even though they were dealing with a busy pre theatre crowd we did not feel rushed at all the menu is quite extensive almost too much so with sushi chinese and other types of cuisine finding its way in but having not tried the more traditional korean dishes before i went for a bibimbap which was excellent even if i would usually prefer a slightly larger portion of chicken in it my wife had the salmon and we shared a starter which were both delicious and even when you include the drinks we still only paid 35 i would definitely come here again regardless of going to the theatre or not ,1
visited after going to the passport office nearby we arrived at 12 00 and 48 later we left at 12 35 the menu had all the korean favourites we began with rice cakes and fish cakes in a sauce and squid which were nice but nothing special we followed these with a pork and beef bibimbap the highlight was the cucumber kimchee with pear the cabbage kimchee was rather lacklustre all in all probably good for the office workers nearby but not particularly relaxing we drank a hite beer and a rice drink,0
the best korean restaurant i ever visited the staff is very attentive and friendly the food is so delicious the menu offers a variety of choices korean bbq or udon noodles or sushi every bite was so delicious note that you need to pay cash here no credit card accepted ,0
really good food and service we went for one of the set meals very nice photo enclosed they did seem to try and rush us at one point but we hadn t booked they didn t become over bearing ,0
i called up yesterday wednesday morning and booked a table for 6pm as was seeing billy elliot in the theatre opposite i booked this with an open mind and was blown away it s a very small intimate restaurant that appears to be family run i had the japchae to start which was beautiful even if i was the only person in the restaurant to eat with a fork my partner had the deep fried prawns which were massive they looked beautiful but our main meals came out before we d finished our starters so i didn t get to try the prawns for main i had the beef bibimbap i am so glad i went with the crowd this dish was delicious rice with egg tasty beef spinach onions absolutely delicious and fun because you get to mix the ingredients and add sauce to your tasting my partner had pork belly with lettuce taco style he said his meat was a bit gristly but the flavours were really good as were the dipping sauces it is very fast service here which was great as within an hour we had a starter main beer and sake in total we spent 53 which is a little pricey but definitely worth it for a treat the sake wine is delicious as is the asahi beer the restaurant picked up in business by about 6 30 7 and had a really nice atmosphere to it if i go to victoria palace theatre again i ll be sure to stop here to try something new ,0
we came here for a pre theatre dinner the restaurant is right opposite wicked the musical service was friendly and we had a good welcome food arrived within about 5 minutes of ordering which was just what we wanted the bibimbaps we ordered arrived sizzling and delicious generous portions and very tasty very reasonably priced too would definitely recommend this place if you re in the area ,1
good tasty korean food and cheerful friendly welcoming service at reasonable prices we d definitely visit again ,1
i was able to book a table the day before my visit which was a good thing because the restaurant was busy the staff was friendly and my friend and i didn t wait too long to get our food this was my third time eating in a korean restaurant first two in paris and i can tell that the food was as delicious and flavoured as in the other ones ate in my only bad point would be the korean tea i was expecting something more impressive with more flavours as for my friend after having had a not so good experience with bibimbap in another korean restasuranrt the one she ordered at lime orange seafood bibimbap completely changed her mind about korean food in a positive way overally everything was worth the 10 service charge ,1
really enjoyed our first korean meal i had a starter only which was huge the other two had a big hot bowl one seafood based the other meat the portions would easily have done for two the chili sauce was served separately so that you could add your own a vg idea very friendly prompt service and reasonably priced we were there early evening pre theatre and there were plenty of free tables we loved the green tea ice cream delicious look forward to another visit ,1
find yourself hungry in the victoria station neighbourhood and it s easy to get very depressed very quickly on offer is the worst that british megachains have to offer nando s etc and little else in that context we were very happy to find lime orange the fact that the restaurant was packed was encouraging so we decided to dive in i really wanted to like the place but left disappointed the problem was that everything we had was desperately bland and lacking in taste we started with the fried sweet and sour fried chicked the sweet taste of the sauce decidedly overpowering any chicken that may have been there then came the seafood pajeon korean pancake it was very anticlimatic and clearly undercooked when this was pointed out they took it back and brought another one after a while which was not much better we ve had much tastier in other places asadal for example then came the bibimbaps we had pork and beef which seemed to be what everyone comes for this too was so bland we almost cried my girlfriend had to shower hers in chili sauce for her tastebuds to feel something anything it was all just sad to lime s credit the portions are generous and we did not leave hungry nor did our evening break the bank did we leave satisfied that s another story ,0
me and my familie went london for holiday and found this place by accident but it was the best meal we had in london london food not bad but when you have deep fryed food and bread for 5 days in a row it has a toll on your body lime orange served real homey food full of flavour also big portions the spices and ingredients used was great we will visit again if we are in london again thank you ,1
cheap cheerful tasty enough said really fast paced restaurant with fairly good standard of everything appeared fresh and arrived at table within 10 minutes perfect place for a lunchtime meal if you don t fancy eating in your office or on a park bench expect to spend about 10 for a meal with drink happy days ,1
we came for lunch and all of us chose the set menu of 22 per person noodles were good and the main beef dish and the chicken were fantastic really filling tasty food will come back again ,1
i went just before going to a show which was round the corner and it was worth trying to get the booking last minute the meal was well presented and very tasty the restaurant itself is very small but bijoux and the ladies washroom is downstairs by the kitchen but not a problem very clean we ordered a bottle of rose wine which at 18 50 was a bit pricey but hey its london enjoy ,1
i ate at lime orange with a friend on a thursday lunch time the reviews on here and my friend made me expect more than it was we got a table eventually and they really rushed us through they kept trying to get us to pay the bill but we were still talking there wasn t anyone waiting for a table so i wasn t sure why they hurried us the food was nice it was yummy and reasonable for 9 for a lunch i don t think i d go back as there are nicer places in that area for the same cost or less ,1
words cannot describe this resturant service food and service was excellent i would like to go back again and just fyi they only take cash,1
had a quick meal before a theatre show food was excellent value and delish just a note they only take cash so be prepared ,1
decided to visit after reading good reviews on trip advisor glad we did the food was delicious got the set dinner number 3 which was delicious and loads of food staff nice too would defo recommend ,1
went here with some work colleagues as we wanted something to eat after work found this by accident and it was just brilliant great little find ,1
eat here last saturday prior to theatre wow place was packed with korean customers tucking in menu completely off my radar but very helpful staff proposed a couple of items great fun stirring in the egg to cook it exceptional flavours filling dishes cash only by the way book your table at busy times total recommendation we ll be back ,1
outstanding food unpretentious place to enjoy authentic korean food prices reasonable but bulgolgi dinner didn t include side dishes however the the side dishes ordered separately were generous ,1
i d walked past this place so many times before a colleague recommended it went on a monday evening and luckily didn t need a reservation but we got the last free table there had the seafood pajeon which was delicious and shared the beef bbq and bibimbap so tasty really good quality for money as well friend had actually been to korea and said it was comparable bring cash if you go as they don t take card ,1
what a surprise a cracking little restaurant in heart of london walked in full o koreans it was looking good waitress superb advised us what to get and when it arrived in a matter of minutes showed how to eat our barbecue chicken with lettuce and rice gorgeous fresh and tasty food 2 minutes from victoria station and 10 seconds from the appollo theatre treat yourself if you want something different,1
great little asian restautant with different types of meals on the menu flavours is full and good sized portions did not try the bbq but have heard it is good ,1
a great place for a swift korean or japanese themed meal a nice selection of classic korean fare all served hot and quickly using fresh ingredients and with friendly service didn t try the japanese menu which is much smaller as korean seemed to be the main event recommended ,1
this is s great spot if your in a hurry for super quick and tasty food nothing glamorous to look at but the food and price makes up for it if you like asian food it s worth a visit ,1
we needed somewhere pre theatre and found this place through tripadvisor it was a great find offering great tasting food at a good price i d recommend the bimimbap which is an interesting diy stir fry all comes in a red hot pot add chilli to taste and keep stirring whilst it continues cooking very tasty and filling and under a tenner ,1
i ve never eaten korean food before sdo this was a first for me the waiter was great at explaining the menu and what might suit me the food is delivered very quickly and is value for money however only cash payments are taken which requires a bit of planning i found the food ok i think it was a little bland for my taste we went on a monday evening and were able to get a table straight away but it did get quite busy towards 8pm so would advise to book if,1
good food and quick service the only thing to note is that they don t take card payments there is a cash point nearby but it s worth knowing i d go back to try another dish from the menu it s a 5 minute walk from victoria station ,0
my friend and i both wanted something slightly different so we visited lime orange for lunch during the week they offered a good value set lunch 3 courses and a glass of wine for 17 but we were already eyeing up some of the different starters my friend had been before and highly recommended it we had the fried kimchee tofu spicy fried chicken to start and beef bimbimbap and pork belly bimbimbap along with some cold kimchee and miso to accompany the mains my friend asked for lettuce instead of rice and they were more than obliging we finsish with a scoop each of the black sesame and green tea ice cream black sesame was a real treat ask for no topping it was fairly busy for during the week lunch service and the staff were lovely would come back again for sure ,1
went for lunch here with some colleagues i couldn t decide whether to get the 4 99 lunch special or not and ultimately decided to get something else the beef bibimbap hot pot it was filling and tasty one of my colleagues got the beef bulgogi special and said it was ok high marks for the spicy chicken bulgogi though i liked that the place wasn t too crowded even at 1pm and we could get a table right away the food was good and the prices reasonable the only areas for improvement are to start taking credit cards cash only and make it easier to get the wait staff s attention ,1
i have eaten at lime orange a few times now over the last couple of years as i am on business i normally dine alone it is a small restaurant and most of the customers are korean the first thing that you notice is the attentive service you are greeted and seated immediately you walk in by very polite friendly staff when you are ready to order a waiter or waitress appears straight away and if you look up because you need something else you are quickly attended to the menu includes korean favourites and curiously a sushi selection the food is tasty and arrives very quickly wine is about the cheapest you will find in this part of london one thing to note is that at present it is cash only ,1
i went here just by my self lunch time om friday and was full 15min waiting and i feel so glad i wait i order most popular dish bibimbap so so so tasty 9 20 for bibimbap and 1 5coke food was served in about 10min i was surprised due to so busy they do daily special too around 4 50 wow no easy parking around if you in rush take away it s a option ,1
i really like this place it s not a chain and it shows with the service being so friendly the food is excellent and quick as well i miss the raw beef bibimbap which seems to have been removed from the menu last time i went i had the full korean bbq which we cooked on the grill built into the table it was great i highly recommend the cucumber kimchee and calamari starters accompaniments ,1
their lunch menu at 4 99 or 3 99 as take away is good but could do with better portions otherwise their food is tasty and staff are very friendly ,1
good korean food located near victoria station the tofu soup and beef babimbab was what i need after being on the road for more than a week the price is reasonable ,1
this small korean japanese cuisine restaurant ist just behind the victoria station and behind the wicked the theater we enjoyed the dinner from the starters to the main everything was delicious and we liked it don t miss the bibimbap the traditional corean rice dish it was really nice as starter we got the spicy calamari well done the pa jeon pancakes delicious and we finished it with different bibimbap try it out it s worth it ,1
we came here to have a quick dinner before the show the location is very good it just oppsit the the show we oreder the rice dish i forgot how to call it it was amazing there are a lot of veggi and a bit spicy the food is very fast and ee dont have to worry about kate to the show ,1
my nephews and i visited the place because it was so conveniently located from the musical wicked and must say we all left very happy the service was very quick food bursting with flavours and staff very polite the dish that stood out to me the most was the chicken bimbap which is a rice dish with 7 beautifully marinated vegetables and some spicy sauce to top it off definitely recommended to people looking for somewhere to eat before the theatres or to eat in general ,1
a bulgogi salad to start was nice but both the main courses beef babingka for mw wife and tofu bibingka for me were tasteless as was the flavourless soup that accompanied the mains we had two cups of korean tea at 1 80 each and were surprised to find that there were no free refills also in all korean restaurants there are complimentary nibbles kimchi whitebait like fish etc here the kimchi was a pricey 2 00 if it were not for the nice korean people serving us this rating would have rated terrible we would not go back or recommend it ,1
it is still one of my favorite places in london near victoria station where to go and have a lunch or dinner i think everyone can find something to tickle their taste buds service is great food delicious and simple easy going ambiance please note that this place can get packed while not only me found this place as great eating venue prices are moderate ,1
excellent food always i have been here a few times now and have always been a happy customer the service is fast and the staff is friendly and helpful even if you aren t a fan of hot stone bowls i highly recommend the bibim baps they could however beef up the dessert menu ,1
the food is really good and tasty its a bit too expensive for regular lunch some meals dont come with any sides i e lettuce or rice so need to pay for that extra on top ,1
my first time trying korean food have been wanting to for a while and was certainly not disappointed ordered the kimchee bibimbap which was excellent very tasty and served in a cast iron bowl which was sizzling away for ages good value and seems to be well frequented by koreans always a good sign with asian food will return as soon as i can ,1
never told us it was cash only because card machine was broken until very end food was okay i recommend the bibimbap,1
very friendly staff more than happy to help and explain the menu service was quick and professional food excellent and very nicely presented price was good all in all would recommend ,1
right across the road from apollo theatre so ideal for pre show unassuming place which was practically empty when we arrived at 18 00 which made me a bit nervous but was full within 10 mins my first time eating korean food and it was lovely particularly the the kim che pancake starter which was absolutely delicious the guy serving was excellent as we knew nothing about the menu good food good value good service good location be aware that the mains are quite filling and having starters and mains and then going straight to sit for a few hours in the theatre left us feeling like a good walk home afterwards ,1
first time eating korean food and i must say it was absolutely delicious the atmosphere was nice and warm the staff was very patient and welcoming very recommended ,1
my friend and i went to lime orange on a friday evening for a pre theatre meal i was very excited about dining here due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews on google however we left feeling disappointed and did not feel like we had our korean food fix we started with the kimchi jeon pancake which was sickly sweet the pancake was loaded with spring onions and very little kimchi with the negligible amount of kimchi in the pancake they might as well rename the dish spring onion pancake with traces of kimchi my friend and i joked about the chef mistaking sugar for salt my main was a seafood soup dish with rice it was ok but nothing memorable hardly any seafood apart from the tiniest pieces of squid we ordered green tea ice cream for dessert the ice cream was drizzled with lots of strawberry sauce this was not described in the menu they should have served it on the side the sauce was super sweet fortunately the waiter was happy to replace the ice cream this time without the sauce the ice cream itself although very enticingly described in the menu was not good at all it wasn t smooth and had bits of ice in it it tasted cheap overall very very disappointed we went to lime orange with high expectations but the food for us was unfortunately a bit meh ,0
we enjoyed a pre theatre supper here last night before seeing wicked great food very quick service but you definitely need to book as it is quite small and popular with the theatre trade cinnamon punch was expensive for what it was small glass at 2 50 but generally speaking food was hot tasty and freshly cooked to order the stone bowl dishes are a must will definitely return if in the area ,1
for asian food this is the place to go amazing bibimap and pickled veg vegan friendly also great meat and seafood not the biggest place but always packed with people like me who work 2 mins down the road and cheap,1
visited as work colleague recommended for night out small restaurant so booking is essential service was friendly and attentive perhaps a touch too fast made me think the food was warmed up as it was delivered so quickly menu exciting and varied both japanese and korean options and waiter advised on how to choose and select options unfortunately i must have chosen a duff off the menu as my katsu chicken udon was far noodles with some deep friend chicken on it the special sauce accompanying it was i swear hp brown sauce still udon noodles were tasty perhaps i just choose the wrong food but rest of table said things were nice but not great unfortunately i think it s a case of a restaurant getting away with serving poor food to a tourist market it s right near wicked and billy elliot touch too expensive for what we got would visit one more time to give it a go and try some different food takes cards but reluctantly ,0
we visited this restaurant prior to a theatre visit having never eaten at a korean restaurant before i wasn t too sure what to select the waiter was most helpful in guiding me through the menu our food was so delicious with delicate flavours and spices the hints of lemongrass could be tasted behind the spice i was very impressed the desert iced creams were also curiously different in flavours but taste divine if i m back in london soon i ll certainly return ,1
first time for korean food and was not sure what to expect staff were very helpful and recommended a great spread food was delicious and staff very welcoming ,1
having researched a suitable restaurant for a pre theatre meal we settled on lime orange after reading the reviews it turned out to be an excellent choice and we thoroughly enjoyed our first korean meal the menu had plenty of choices the staff were pleasant helpful and the food was delicious highly recommended ,1
i used to work close to this place and have visited many times we went back there on friday night with a group of 6 and it was still excellent food and service it s nothing fancy just very good korean caf√© food i e the usual selection of udon noodle dishes bulgolgi kimchee etc the star is the hot stone bowl bibimap dishes where you can choose beef chicken pork seafood or tofu with a combination of vegetables rice and spicy sauce the prices are very reasonable as well 100 for 6 of us with a selection of starters and 6 bibimaps including drinks victoria is a depressing place when it comes to food but this caf√© is a real find ,1
great korean food in westminster i ordered a hot stone pot beef bibimbap it is really tasty and you can add the chili sauce as much as you like friendly staff made me have a good dinner experience i d love to be a regular ,1
nice restaurant waiter helpful in ordering we ordered hot stone bowl with beef vegetables and egg yolk this was lovely noodles with chicken in a sauce i was disappointed noodles were nice but chicken was in breadcrumbs with sauce dribbled on top not what i was expecting overall it was nice although not real korean food ,0
excellent service the waiter was well informed of the menu and the service was fast and the food was great good prices for a pre theatre meal ,1
my colleague introduced me to lime orange last week where we ordered the special of the day yukgae jang to take away we were greeted pleasantly by the staff and took our orders very quickly the service was fast as we did not have to wait long unfortunately the food was cold by the time we brought it back to the office we re not very far from the restaurant either but it tasted great given the portion size and that it s only 4 for the special i d definitely go back and try another special of the day again if you happen to be working around the area it s very close to the station and you probably have to wait about as long as queuing up to pay for a sandwich at pret i would definitely recommend it and i will be visiting again very soon ,1
my boyfriend and i were looking for a place to eat before going to see wicked during the last weekend of february and we came across lime oranage just across the road form the theatre we went in not knowing what to expect but we were met by friendly staff and a huge menu that left us deciding for quite a while we both took the bibimbap which came up quickly and was piping hot it was absolutely delicious and we both thoroughly enjoyed out meals we each had a beer as well after our main we shares some of the green tea ice cream another totally new flavour and not an unpleasant one either i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick pre theatre meal as you will not be disappointed ,1
we ate here due to the excellent reviews the food is similar to that served by our local japanese restaurant so we had something to compare it to the miso soup was thin and watery the noodles were lukewarm and tasteless we ordered seafood and vegetables but the only vegetables were a few peppers and onions the staff paid very little attention to us although when asked whether we d enjoyed our meal and told it was not very hot said they would have heated and took the service charge off our bill a disappointing experience ,0
we went here before seeing wicked and it was great it was bustling which was a great sign and deserved to be the staff are very good the atmosphere nice and the food lovely we ordered the bulgogi a bbq item served with rice and lettuce and it was great nice to try something authentically korean as well rather than the standard items if i knew people going to wicked i would say eat here good quick food and a lovely pre theatre feel ,1
enjoyed a superb meal at lime orange following great reviews on trip advisor our 1st experience of korean food and can thoroughly recommend ,1
we had no idea what to expect when we went to lime orange with friends the other night from the outside it looks rather unremarkable but we were greeted very warmly by the staff inside the decor was simple and the atmosphere welcoming the menu is quite extensive and we didn t really know where to begin thankfully someone in our party who had been there before ordered for us and we were treated to some truly delicious dishes the japchae sweet potato noodles and beef bulgogi were particular favourites with us but everything we tasted was truly delicious and quite importantly not over salted portions were super generous and we could have probably ordered less than we did but we re grateful we got to try so much next time i think we ll go for two rounds of japchae the beef bibimbap which is a comforting big stone pot of rice with meat veg and a raw egg yolk which cooks in the heat of the pot and the beef bulgogi it s not super cheap but it s good value for the size of the portions and the overall quality we can t wait to go back ,1
i love this place very small in terms of seating so make sure you book a table at busy times but it is worth it the service from the staff is great and the food is delicious fresh and quick to come out of the kitchen also as a vegetarian i felt there was a decent amount of options for me which is always a huge plus ,1
i have eaten here twice in the last month the first time was in a group of 6 before seeing billy elliot the waiter was very patient with us explaining the menu happily explaining what everyone else was eating as we were looking around he recommended the kimchee jeon as a starter which was delicious the tempura was plentiful i m a vegetarian and had the hot stone pot tofu bibimbap this is a bowl of rice vegetables and tofu there is a raw egg yolk on the top that cooks as you mix it all in with chilli sauce you do this yourself so choose how spicy you want it it was delicious the second time i took my god daughter as we were seeing wicked it s literally over teh road i had the same again it was so delicious first time around and she had the fish bobimbap there was plenty of different types of fish and she loved it once again brilliant service and delicious food some advice definitely call up and book in advance it s so busy and popular we booked both times lots of disappointed people or people who had to wait it s quite small so there s not lots of room to wait in also they prefer cash they do take cards so i highly recommend it great food service and atmosphere plus it s so close to both shows ,1
this is a great korean restaurant in the heart of london it may not look like much from the outside but inside the food is spot on everything that my party had was very fresh and clean tasting exactly what you expect from korean food perhaps the only let down was that we ordered bbq and thought we could cook it ourselves on the grill but it came pre cooked thankfully it was delicious ,1
this is a small korean restaurant it was welcoming and friendly and made you feel at home this was my first experience of korean food and it was good i particularly enjoyed the plum tea this is a good place for a good meal at a fair price ,1
arrived for pre theatre lunch greeted by the hostess promptly who gave a wonderful and friendly service first korean restaurant experience and help in choosing from the gorgeous selection in the menu was given with a smile the food was fresh and beautifully presented sake was a definite acquired taste but when taken as a shot disappeared quick lol i cannot fault my time at this restaurant and recommend it highly it opened at 12 and we were the first in the door followed to a virtual full house within 30 minutes so booking could be adviseable ,1
this is the first time i ve visited the restaurant and wasn t disappointed it s a fairly small restaurant and as we went there early on a tuesday we didn t have an issue getting a table the restaurant is a stones throw from the entrance of victoria station so nearby for the apollo theatre the waiters were helpful and showed my friend how best to eat her dish and also added advice as to how to make mine taste the best the advice was gratefully received i went for the tofu bibbimap which was very tasty and it was nice not to have plain tofu the dishes were also reasonably priced along with the beer too ,1
my daughter and i visted lime orange pre theatre after i saw the good reviews on tripadvisor im glad to say we were not disappointed the restaurant is small but despite there being a lot of diners it didnt feel crowded the waiter who served us was friendly and welcoming offering tips on the food the food was amazing i had seafood bibimbap which was delicious packed with flavour and came with chilli sauce to add to taste my daughter had katsu udon noodles which we both agreed was the best katsu we had tasted and there was plenty of it the prices were really reasonable too approx 8 10 for a main meal and soft drinks a bargain at 1 50 our new years resolution is now to learn how to use chop sticks as we were too embarrassed to ask for a fork thank you for a lovely dining experience which was one of the highlights of our trip ,1
i was really pleasantly surprised by lime orange it s quite small and on a busy road you d easily miss it but a friend took me and assured me it was delicious the staff were friendly and gave lots of useful information about the dishes the menu was varied quality was great i opted for chicken bibimbap which was fun and tasty the prices are really good especially considering the central location i ll certainly be going back ,1
this restaurant is tucked behind wicked the show in victoria i had the king prawns for starters that were cooked in a tempura batter they were huge and delicious for main i had the chicken biibimbap which was absolutely lovely very flavoursome very reasonable prices the staff were attentive but not too much thankfully i cannot recommend this little restaurant highly enough if you want good tasty korean food this is the place for you probably best to book first as it gets very busy ,1
i have to say this is one of the best korean restaurants i have been to just a few minutes from victoria station and theaters around i had the beef bibimpap and kimchee on the side it was fresh authentic and delicious after travelling through europe for a week and living on junk this was the best to home cook meal i have had the staff are nice the place is very neat and prices great highly recommended,1
we ve been to lime orange 3 times and we always leave very satisfied the bibimbap is delicious and very filling but the highlight of this restaurant is probably the korean barbecue you can chose to grill your meat yourself which is a very fun experience all the bulgogi meats are tender and full of flavour the kimchee pancake as a starter is superb as is the black sesame ice cream for dessert on top of delicious and fresh food the staff is great and friendly we only have great things to say about this place there is definitely no need to go to more expensive or busy korean restaurants in soho ,1
friends at work had suggested somewhere else to support as part of the amex shop small campaign but then i found this place and we managed to book a table we arrived and the place had a queue which is always a good sign we were seated at our table and given menus to begin analysing there may be a lot of there but it all sounds great and judging by the food we all received it s all done to a decent standard we tried a range of dishes including the raw beef bibimbap chicken katsu udon salmon teriyaki and yukgae jang and teverything we had was bursting with flavour and well prepared this is good korean food with plenty of options to include everyone now also very curious about their sushi too the prices are reasonable and the staff are very friendly it s quite a small restaurant and they do recommend on their website to book in advance having seen how busy it gets i would definitely agree we all agreed we would definitely be back ,1
this place is not expensive but very high quality there seem to be a lot of koreans who eat there and many people who are repeat trade dropping in for a very quick meal the classic korean dish bibimbap was fantastic and seems to be especially popular but it s a very large portion for one the wine was great too we ll definitely be going back it s very easy to get to very near to victoria station ,1
ideally located for victoria s theatres the food is plentiful for the price and really authentic and tasty the waiter was really helpful to our tastes would definitely advise popping in for dinner or if you work in the area they do daily specials for only 3 99 which is a super price for the area ,1
popped in for an early dinner before a gig and to sample our first taste of korean food we were not disappointed there was plenty to chose from on the menu and the staff were happy to advise choices to our taste we shared some chicken dumplings to start which were lovely i had the pork bulgogi which was really really good i had it with lettuce and rice as advised and costs extra you wrap it and eat with your hands yum it was a big portion and i thought the rice was unnecessary but the lettuce was a nice fresh way to serve and enjoy the pork and i might try it at home the other half had katsu chicken with udon noodles it was also really tasty and a good generous portion we were both chuffed especially as he works a stones throw and will be able to pop in and enjoy the lunchtime specials location is very convenient for victoria just a 2 minute walk behind the apollo theatre ,1
loved the bulgogi and some very tasty starters kimchi pancake was very tasty crispy and savoury one of the best i ve had quick and cosy dinner before seeing a show asset a nearby theatre ,1
visited here on a saturday night as a pre theatre meal ideal location as across the road from the victoria apollo it doesn t look much but don t be fooled we booked for 5pm when they open and for first 15mins we were the only ones there but it soon started to fill up so booking is a must the waiter was attentive helpful but not intrusive recommending dishes etc the food was lovely and very tasty and it was very filling i thought the prices were reasonable 2 starters 2 main courses 3 sides 2 puddings large glass of wine coke bottle of water was 55 inc service charge we will definitely be returning so sample more of the menu real gem of a place ,0
i visit this place really a lot it s so close to victoria station so the location is very convenient the restaurant is small but the food is very nice i would say it is pretty authentic for london i would also say that the food is pretty cheap some of my favorite menus from this restaurant are pork bibimbab bulgogi and dokpokki sorry if i spelled some wrong to sum up good food convenient location good value ,1
this is a great little restaurant only two mins away from victoria station and from the theatres showing wicked and billy elliot scrumptious corean food and decent prices very friendly service ,1
we visited lime orange for a quick dinner before going to the theatre and it certainly didn t disappoint the set menu two courses with wine and tea coffee was excellent came out very promptly and was a good price if you want something different to the standard fare around victoria i d thoroughly recommend this restaurant ,1
i really hope this is visited by more than asian people and people who have a taste for oriental food it deserves to be successful we went for an early dinner service was excellent and the food was amazing i thought po cha near tottenham court road did the best korean pancakes but there is a new champion in town near where i live i will be visiting here again and again the salmon dish was top tier as well ,1
wasn t too hungry but had a hour or two to kill so went in for a snack and a glass of wine we were recommended 4 starters which were all delicious especially the spicy calamari the place was almost empty when we went in but filled up very fast lucky we went in so early recommending to people who are looking for somewhere to eat before their show ,1
not much need to be said excellent food with excellent service plain welcoming decoration would definitely go back ,1
hello just about to get the gatwick express to gatwick and thought i would try and find a decent meal first i did nice food and a bit different to standard curry and thai worth a visit staff very nice and was quick service ,1
my friend and i brought a couple of friends from croatia who never had korean food before here it was rather late at night when we arrived around 9pm i ordered a spicy seafood noodle while the rest of them stone pot bibimpap dinner was absolutely lovely and we had a great time chatting even after finishing our meal we stayed in lime orange until all other diners have left we left the restaurant at 10 50pm and then we noticed the closing time was 10 30pm how kind was the staff not to patronise us regarding the closing hour we were so grateful and slightly embarrassed for keeping her so late i m regretting not to apologising to her back then i might do so the next time i come to lime orange again ,1
ordered prawn tuigim and spicy calamari for starters both arrived in record time and we watched as the restaurant filled up equally fast the food was tasty and good we also ordered beef bibimbap and beef bulgogi the waiter recommended lettuce and rice with the beef bulgogi and neglected to mention there was an extra charge for both the rice and the lettuce there was also a 10 service charge added to the bill i suggested he add a statement to the menu noting the extra charge for the rice and the lettuce he good naturedly removed the excess charges the 10 service charge was not amended and no record of our meal was provided following our cash payment we would eat here again in spite of non disclosure of costs involved ,1
i just loved this place foods were great and lovely service i m so glad that we made the effort to go there ,1
i have eaten here twice both times with a friend the first time i thought the food was pretty good especially the starter of spicy calamari my main of beef bulgogi was a bit too salty and didn t come with any lettuce my second visit was a few weeks later again i ordered the spicy calamari which was pretty good but this time i went for the beef bibimbap and found it very bland also both times the service wasn t very good i waited a very long time both times before anyone came to take our orders also one of the times we were running late by about 10 minutes as we were on the tube we didn t have signal to ring ahead and let them know as we arrived the waitress very sacasrtically said we re a bit late aren t you i wasn t impressed i don t think i ll be returning here as there are many better korean restaurants in central london ,0
i popped in for a quick post work feed the staff were friendly and helpful the atmosphere unpretentious and relaxed the food most importantly was brilliant i had the calamari some of the best i have had the kimchee which is not to everyone s taste but worth a try then the bibimbap which was incredibly tasty great value service and food perfect for a quick feed before a late train from victoria enjoy ,1
my colleagues and i found ourselves in sw1 for an evening before a trade show and all agreed we should try something different being a tripadviser geek nowadays i took charge and came across lime orange with positive reviews and nobody being overly au fait with korean food it was decided that lime orange would be the place for us despite some recent rather derogatory reviews i m pleased to say that our experience was a overall a positive one the restaurant itself is pretty basic but clean and welcoming which is unfortunately not a given late ish on a tuesday night in london the staff were friendly and accommodating at the beginning having not tried korean before our likes and dislikes were taken into account before recommendations were offered for starters and mains but after that i would have to say that service was average at best although the food service was rather slow especially considering we were one of four tables in that evening i would never complain when the food is as good as it was however we did outline upon arrival at 8 30pm that our colleague needed to leave at 9 45pm for a conference call but come 9 40pm he still didn t have his main meal not a problem normally but our circumstances meant this caused quite the issue what irked me the most was the general service which was a shame after such a positive start in between serving and going to kitchen the staff stood with their back to the restaurant chatting among themselves by the till this made it nigh on impossible to place a drinks order and it took me leaning across into their conversation to get their attention for the water we had ordered 10 minutes earlier the restaurant bills itself as korean bbq and there are even gas grills built into some of the tables our table had one but the only downer of taking the recommendations were that none of our dishes incorporated a bbq element which in hindsight seemed odd and an opportunity missed by the staff service aside it must said the food was very very good everything was fresh tasty and the we all thoroughly enjoyed every dish we shared from the pickled beansprouts vegetable dumplings extremely refreshing cucumber dish to the lemon chicken noodles and beef to name but a few i think we over ordered somewhat another big bonus was the price 4 people multiple bottles of beer wine two courses each and sharing sides all came in at a very reasonable price of around 20 per head these two final points are the reason i have bumped this up from average to very good poor service can easily be corrected and can be down to the individuals on the night but food of this quality at this price deserves to be shouted about ,0
we ordered beef bulgogi which the menu said it had fruits in it it came just with fried beef and a few pieces of capsicum in it for 9 20 the food gave me a tummy ache after that the service was appalling the guy at the counter was on his phone without a care in the world he was quite smelly as well i will never go that way in my life again absolute rip off i m sorry to write this but it was rubbish and waste of money i don t know how people are putting good reviews on this ,0
this is a small korean eatery which is very popular with korean tourists we were walking around victoria area and decided to give it a try it was crowded and we are lucky to get a table the service staff is courteous but they tend to be overwhelmed but the crowd so be patient with them price is reasonable ps order a delicious chicken soup which you have to wait for 30mins email me if you want to know the item on menu ,1
very good korean food bibimbap is very good and the mixed b b q bulgogi is not as good recommande with soju ,1
i ve been to a fair few korean places in london whilst it may lack the homely atmosphere of some places it makes up for it with its delicious food i had a kimchee pancake and chicken bibimbap both were brilliant in taste texture and flavour simply delicious i wasn t even hugely hungry but i somehow managed to finish the entire bibimbap which was quite large the prices are also reasonable given the central london location it s so close to victoria station which is very convenient and i ll definitely be returning soon to try out more of the menu ,1
the food was amazing big variety of dishes to choose from staff were attentive and polite without being invasive very nice atmosphere in the restaurant very good value for money ,1
we booked this restaurant based on all the positive reviews unfortunately we found nothing positive about the food we ordered the rib eye steak and salmon teriyaki from the grill section as you don t get anything with either dish we both ordered a bowl of sticky rice each the steak was tiny overcooked and fatty and the rice was just plain nothing to write home about although the salmon was a good size it just tasted burnt and was in a pool of soy sauce overall the food was very disappointing the staff were not very helpful it was a big disapointment after all the good reviews it got we were both still hungry so had to get a burger from mcdonalds before going to the theatre ,0
just across the road from the victoria apollo it couldn t be handier we looked at the italian next door but the prices were steeper than the lime orange the menu was varied and had plenty to choose from so all tastes are catered for i would have given 5 stars except my beer came in a dirty glass and the service while not bad could have been a little better the young waiter was helpful keen and took time to explain the dishes we were served by two staff so the quality varied from ok to very good the food was tasty and plentiful and though the restaurant was filling up we did not feel rushed worth a try ,1
we stumbled on this place and were so happy with our discovery the food was hot delicious and came quickly we were there pretty early 6pm for the price there was a good amount of food especially compared to the italian next door yummy main meal for under 10 pounds the waiting staff were very friendly and we will be going back next time we re in london for a show ,1
i tried this restaurant after reading the reviews on here i was most disappointed we were the 1st in the restaurant at approx 5 45pm but the service was appalling we were not given any advice explanations or recommendations about the dishes on the menu we were served by 3 different people with the main waitress not talking to us at all when the dishes were delivered or removed the plates we asked for a glass of water to accompany the other drinks we ordered and was given warm tap water with no ice we were not offered mineral water we asked for the menu to order tea when we had finished eating we waited over 20 mins and order still not taken also waited a long time to pay the bill so much so we only just made the start of the show we booked to see ,0
i found this place when i was walking around victoria station and the food is really good and the staff very kind recommended it ,1
a simple lunch special for under 5 tasty and really fresh today being thursday is a dumpling soup but every day is different looking forward to being in victoria on a tuesday for ribs ,1
this place literary took me back to soul to real korean restaurant food was good service excellent prices reasonable for london food has been brought rather quickly only as spicy seafood pancake was less spicy than in soul but other than that very fine ,1
stumbled across this restaurant by chance after the theatre so glad we did we were made very welcome on arrival service was prompt are ordering and having not eaten korean before were offered plenty of advice and suggestions especially for the children food was fantastic and delicious even the children tried something new for a change will definitely return well worth a visit ,1
went here on the recommendation of friends service was excellent the staff even gave suggestions of combinations and were very knowledgeable the food came in good time and was excellent and not overpriced would go here again and recommend to any one ,1
was searching for a quick dining place just before a musical and found lime orange it s a small family operated korean restaurant with very simple yet comfortable decor wait staff was approachable yet not intrusive left us to look through the menu until we were ready to order when asked for recommendation he was able to suggest a few dishes which were very much enjoyable we had seafood pancake kimchi hot pot and beef bibimbap simple comfort food which made such a wonderful dining experience for us i would recommend any one who likes a simple korean dining experience and those catching a musical with an hour to spare ,1
i don t normally write reviews but it just has to be done the lady who owns the restaurant needs to stop telling us when and how we put siracha on our bibimbaps how we should be doing with the food we are eating it has been occasions where she has purposely took hold of the siracha and has put it all over my sister s food to the point she found it too spicy if she is reading it you need to know when to let people do what the hell they like with the food they are paying for you may not like it but hell we are the ones paying to eat there i won t be going there because of another attempt of eating there she has tried to smother my food with siracha when i told her no i do not recommend this place to people who just want to eat how they want ,0
really tasty food especially the korean dishes lots of which are new to us the meals are cooked and served very quickly attentive waiters who are happy to explain the dishes give time to read the menu and don t disturb you mid meal asking if its ok this is one of my favourite restaurants in london as the food is simply so tasty and interesting but perhaps not somewhere to take your first date as the decor is a little plain i ve been back many times and is a place i like to take friends who i know appreciate food i definitely recommend it ,1
came here the third time last twice ordered bimbimbap which is nice however what i order today the teriyaki chicken udon was too salty doesnt really taste the chicken and udon but the salty sause small restaurant which not recommend for a bunch of peoples more than 4 peoples ,0
i m sorry but this is literally the worst sushi i ve ever had in my entire life if you can t do it better not to put it on the menu all the rolls are so loose that i can t even pick up by chopsticks avocado was so unripe very hard and taste horrible friend had the hot pot soup with seafood she says not very fresh seafood and too salty ,0
my daughter and i visited this restaurant a few nights ago for pre theatre dinner and it was really good our server was extremely helpful and efficient and the food delicious although the cinnamon punch was not my thing i will definitely return if i m back in the area ,1
i have been to this restaurant twice i suppose the experience was pretty good for me although my korean friend wasn t too satisfied it served japanese food previously but now i suppose they focus on korean food which probably is a right decision as they are korean not japanese i had pajeon and bibimbap pajeon was crispy and lots of seafoods are mixed too though my korean friend told that they already prepared it a while ago and reheated re panfried again now which you never know at least for me it was crispy and nice stone bowl of bibimbap was well heated so that you have a little bit of burnt rice that i really appreciate korean lady seems smiley and nice i think it s a nice little korean restaurant in victoria ,1
we frequent lime orange often my girlfriend and i always walk out happy the bip and baps are very tasty and filling the miso soup good wait staff very attentive the restaurant is an odd shape so you kind of feel like you are sitting at your neighbours table but for the price it is fine also have korean beer ,1
we visited here as part of hubby s birthday celebrations we had read the reviews on here but hadn t been before or even had it recommended to us we were not disappointed we chose a set menu thinking it would give us a variety of choice we had kimchee juon chicken bibimbap with miso soup then black sesame ice cream the set menu also included a glass of house white or red wine all the food was delicious the service was friendly and efficient if we are ever in this part of london again then we ll definitely go back ,1
superb food jam packed full of flavour all served by incredibly friendly and welcoming staff a truly superb venue at an affordable cost thank you very much ,1
knowing nothing about korean food we chose from the set three course menu delicious food nicely presented the food was obviously freshly made to order and ingredients good quality we were brought a jug of water without asking for it service on a friday evening was good we thought that under 40 for two three course meals and one drink each was very reasonable and we were certainly well fed ideal place for a quick pre theatre meal will visit again ,1
so close to victoria station very nice location and warm welcome clean also the toilette i have tried many korean restaurant an d this is for me the best food is delicious ,1
visited this lovely place before a trip to the theatre delicious food and excellent service obviously family run which adds the the ambience the traditional korean bbq is a must ,1
this place is a little hidden gem it s a small restaurant and can be easily missed but i m so glad we found it the service was very good and attentative and the food was excellent it was my first time eating korean bbq and the server was extremely helpful with suggestions and guidance the food was very flavorful the portions were generous the sushi portion was the biggest i have ever seen and very well done sushi the bibmbap was super tasty we had leftovers and we were sad we couldn t pack them up ,1
i visited lime orange twice already the first with my gf and second with family the reception was great they are always smiling and willing to help and the food was different but easy to please bibimbap is a must and i would recommend the korean bbq together if in a bigger group oh the ambient looks a little fancy but it s cheaper than a lot of good pubs and restaurants ,1
after a long day this was the perfect first diner of our holidays all the dishes were especially tasty udon chicken fried buttered prawns glas noodles even the fried rice the beef bulgogi was a special experience as you roll it yourself in a cabbage leave try the korean ricewine makgeolli cool and milky the service was very friendly and attentive the kid s special wishes and dietary changes were gladly accepted we will for sure come again ,1
if you are seeking a quick and reasonably priced bibimbap or korean bbq before taking the family to wicked or billy elliott then look no further this straight forward establishment is run very authentically by a husband and wife team value for money and authenticity this place is a good option with no immediate competition in this part of london for aficionados you might find the pajun a tad bit tired looking asadal near holborn has nicer decor and better barbecue but this place is good if you re yearning for kimchi in this part of town ,1
while strooling past lime orange we noticed that it was nicely crowded for a monday and decided to check it out what a great decision that was we shared the veggie dumplings you can pass on that but the bibimbap of beef was to die for one of the best meals we had in a week in london ,1
we showed up about 5 30 on sat evening and walked right in later it became very crowded the service was quick and the food very good by the time we left the service was not as fast ,1
we had our dinner just before a wicked show right across in the apollo victorian and were not disappointed the food as well as the drink plum tea yum yum was very good the only downside was that one of the two waitresses had to take a break or something and one waitress being alone in a well visited place was not good we had to wait a little to get our check but it wasn t that big of a problem also as usual with asian restaurants food marked as non spicy isn t necessarily completely non spicy so be sure to ask the staff before ordering,1
stopped in for a quick dinner before heading home and were very pleased with what we found service was very friendly and the food was fantastic something new for us but we very much enjoyed it delicious ,1
myself and my wife attended the restaurant prior to a trip to see wicked lime orange is directly opposite the theatre so perfect to eat beforehand when we arrived it was around 5pm and the place was empty but after reading the positive reviews we went in there was a very pleasant male staff member in charge we ordered starters and mains we both had the bibimbap for our main meals which is an authentic korean dish that comes in a sizzling dish and has lot of various ingredients and an egg yolk the waiter explained that you add chilli sauce and mix it all up yourself it was absolutely delicious my only slight complaint is that the main meals arrived whilst we were still eating our starters and we are by no means slow eaters but in fairness this my be a bit of a cultural difference and it didn t cause us any problems especially for the fact that the bibimbap came in a red hot dish so retained its heat the overall price including some drinks was 43 which i thought very good value for central london we will definitely return on our next trip to london ,1
i had never been to a korean restaurant before and i really enjoyed the experience very good main course for a bargain and just a block away from victoria station and its theatres ,1
i really enjoyed my korean experience and i would definitely go again take advice from the friendly staff as to what to eat the dishes served to our table of 7 all were beautifully presented and the flavours of them matched this price was ok and the restaurant is very close to victoria station and the theatres near by it is a small restaurant plain and clean service was good the toilets could have been a little cleaner and the space provided for this facility is very small but i am not really complaining just pointing out this fact ,1
the shop looks a little shady initially we were not sure about it but since there was nothing more alluring in the vicinity we decided to go for it to our surprise it was really good the korean fried rice was really good and spicy enough for asians who love extra spiciness had another dish with 4 types of meat can t remember what the dish is called but it was really tasty as well the meats were well marinated the only thing i really hate about it is the horrible lighting it was difficult to eat in the extremely orange lights aside from that i d totally recommend it ,1
on our second night in london we felt for some asian food i am in to korean food and my wife love the japanese kitchen we checked ta and found lime orange and decided to try it located only 2 min walk from victoria station it was very easy to get to we were there pretty early about 17 30 and we were seated directly service was very nice the whole time we had one of the set menues and some sake all courses was perfect and you won t leave lime orange hungry cos you get big portions it is in my opinion not pricey especially not considering the quality of the food our bill came out at 55 for 5 dishes and a bottle of sake i m pretty sure i ve found my favourite place in london here ,1
bumped into this place and very surprised at the food for a place near victoria station the place was empty when we went in as they had just opened but soon filled up recommend the bibimbap ,1
4 5 really tasty food at a very good price for anywhere especially london fast service too recommended ,1
whilst searching for somewhere close to the theatre victoria apollo wicked we found this great restaurant the food was delicious and the service excellent i have eaten korean before but this was the best i have tasted we had the korean bbq and there was plenty to eat for the five of us 3 adults and 2 children certainly recommend this if you are in the area ,1
stayed in hotel nearby and visited after reading previous reviews certainly not disappointed food full of flavour recommend the korean bbq chicken staff v helpful well worth a visit ,1
i went here solo on a monday night and had the chicken bibimbap it was wonderful and i ate every bite came back on a tuesday and had the kimchi fried rice it was good but not as good as the bibimbap my favorite part about korean food is the banchan so on the second visit i ordered the mixed banchan called something else on the menu and it came with pickled bean sprouts radish cucumber and the green spinach like vegetable it was not was i was used to what i typically love was not done right so skip this the cucumber was extremely vinegary and sweet inedible the greens and bean sprouts were ok so my suggestion so far is to stick with the bibimbap i ll go back again for that ,1
hadn t tried korean food before so this was a pleasant surprise the waitress assisted us with our menu choice and although i can t remember the name of the dish we shared it was a platter of 4 different meats that came with rice and lettuce leaves it was ideal for us we were going to see wicked and chanced upon this restaurant it was clean and all staff were polite and friendly will try to make a return visit as the bibimap looked impressive ,1
i did some research before going in to london with my daughter for a service at westminster cathedral we like to try out different cuisines so gave lime orange a go based on reviews on tripadvisor we were not disappointed this restaurant is at the unfashionable end of vauxhall bridge road and looks uninspiring from the outside step inside and it looks like a cafe no scenic views from the window but the service is flawless the food great and if you are new to this they will advise you terrific fresh food served quickly great prices loved it ,1
i visited here on a saturday afternoon with three others we all chose from the korean menu items with two of us having a bibimap an iron couldron like bowl arrived with the prepared ingredients in my case chicken rice vegetables and pickled cabbage neatly arranged we were given chilli sauce to pour over and then mix everything together i really want to find an excuse to visit again so i can have another the bibimap continues to cook in front of you so the flavour and texture developed throughout the meal each dish was flavoured brilliantly and tasted fresh while we went on a saturday lunchtime we didnt take advantage of the lunchtime offer as wanted to choose items from the main menu i thought the food was priced reasonably and i noted that there were some set meals starting from about 15 which included a small gass of house wine i definately recommend a great eat and so conveniently placed right by victoria station the apollo and victoria place theatres ,1
we discovered this place while looking for a place from where we could grab a bite to eat before watching the wonderful musical called wicked that s how we discovered lime orange lovely modern decor inside really fast wireless internet service with a smile and really really great chicken katsu udon i am a huge fan of udon noodles and rarely manage to find a place that makes them just so needless to say i fell for this place and went right back the next day even though we weren t going to watch a musical afterwards if you re a fan of noodles or asian food do give it a try ,1
we got caught in the rain when waiting outside wicked we went round the restaurants around the theatre and we asked each one if they would server us in time for the show the staff at lime orange assured us that we could dine in and make it on time to the show and even helped us choose items on the menu that were both good and quick to make the food was very good and the atmosphere was also very welcoming there were tables all the way out till the entrance door which made them very chilly personally i would suggested eating at a table half way or all the way in ,1
we had an hour before heading across the road to see wicked went as a family and our girls loved the interactive way the food was served and delivered friendly staff we had a set meal for two which was the large hot stone bowls and the mixed bbq with a couple of extra starters ,1
was invited along for a lunch with colleagues and the food was sumptuous grilled salmon and teriyaki sauce despite the modestly sized venue the warmth efficiency and overall high attention service levels ensure you don t feel claustrophobic at all would definitely recommend for a quick yet quality lunch and yes i will be going again ,1
an unexpected find outstanding service from very friendly staff food was outstanding can t wait to go back great place to visit especially if you are visiting nearby theatres ,1
just been here in my lunch break with a few people from the office it was a lovely lunch we had 3 bi bim baps and a large bottle of sparkling water came to just over 30 between us including service the food was really tasty and the service was quick would highly recommend for korean in victoria area ,1
the outside of the restaurant and its name are a slightly off putting but bear with it and you won t be disappointed we ate here on the wednesday before easter and it wasn t very full it could have something to do with the scaffolding outside i don t know and had a really enjoyable meal the waiter explained the menu and made some recommendations on ordering the lettuce to wrap around the meat which was very helpful as this was our first experience of korean food the food was excellent well cooked and tasty although i would have welcomed a gap between our starters and main course which arrived before we d finished eating prices were reasonable for both the food and the wine and i d definitely go back ,1
the food was fabulous and the staff charming and helpful i m not familiar with korean food and we were advised how best to eat it which sauces to dip in and how to mix the starter the two of us even shared all 3 puddings on the menu as we couldn t choose between them i just wish it was closer to home ,1
discovered this little restaurant prior to visiting the victoria apollo theatre to see wicked interesting menu with korean and japanese food the food was hot well cooked and delicious my fussy teenage daughters had no problem eating up their chosen dishes the staff are friendly too i would highly recommend for a pre theatre meal ,1
i visited here with my girlfriend on a friday evening the food was excellent fresh tasting and very reasonably priced i d highly recommend here if you want to try something a little bit different for dinner ,1
this is my second visit to lime orange and i have to say that all the food we had both times was delicious the service was relatively quick most if not all of the food is hand made and it was a nice place to have a meal before the theatre at st james theatre definitely go check this place out ,1
firstly the price was good and more importantly great taste good portion nice selections of starters and nice atmosphere after that i ve been there many times with some friends they all loved it if you are around victoria you should try this one ,1
unable to find a reasonably priced eatery without having booked we took a chance and ate here we had dumplings to start which were very tasty accompanied by an imported korean beer for my main course i had spicey chicken noodles and my partner had chicken katsu udon portions were large and the food was good and inexpensive we d definitely go back here ,1
had to try it once and what a disappointment it was with two people we tried 8 dishes of which 3 were ok a bottle of north korean vodka and a couple of beers 200usd in fact we cam for the show but because of the low season no show until october the staff was super friendly and nice not one male employee in the whole place it seems probably some male minders hiding upstairs to keep the staff from running away ,1
beautiful young women dancing and singing while you eat dinner i understand these women live above the restaurant are not allowed to go outside unless accompanied by their guardians lest they attempt to defect i was told they are selected to come to the restaurant for 3 years at a time sounds like slave labor to me i decided i didn t want to give my money to support slave labor or weapons for north korea so i won t be going back ,0
this was an interesting experience for me and y husband we booked a table in advance for dinner we ve been curious for a while about north korea and visiting this restaurant seemed like a cheaper and safer option than traveling to pyongyang we especially went for the show however we were disappointed as there was no show that day the waitress could barely speak a few words of english but we understood they re not performing anymore such a pity about the food it was actually really good we ordered kimchi rice with kimchi cold noodle soup and some shrimps with vegetables that turned out to be super spicy be aware they do like their spicy food there 1 bottle of water and two beers all for 78 dollars service was fast and apart from the uneatable spicy shrimps everything was delicious waitress are kind of weird but i felt this is because they can t speak english you can see they want to interact but they just don t have the language skills overall an interesting experience just the idea of meeting someone from north korea is interesting in the end you ll hardly cross one of the street ,1
i booked a table and visited this establishment a friday evening it was a very enjoyable experience with traditionally dressed waitresses good food and drinks unusual but pleasant decor and atmosphere comfortable seating attentive table service polite greetings upon arrival and departure no singing dancing show was featured this particular evening and staff lacked sufficient communication skills outside korean or chinese kim bap bibimbap and kimchi were of excellent quality and very reasonably priced however the korean beer was grossly overpriced i e a single 500 ml bottle costing more than most individual dishes recommended ,1
i visited during dinner time with my family reservations recommended as it was quite packed the waitresses are all north koreans and they are also the performers of this restaurant we ordered the cold noodles and some other dishes on the menu and it was delicious the north korea beer is also very nice but slightly more expensive as i don t think you can get it anywhere else the waitresses are pretty and talented they serve food and in between they performed on stage from singing to dancing to even playing musical instruments definitely a must visit if you want to experience north korea cuisine and culture without visiting pyongyang ,1
would anything bad happen to me if i give an honest review anyhow i ll try to be as honest as possible the service and performance is excellent but no photo taking is allowed thats as much as i can say will most probably go back but only for the unforgettable performance ,1
my family decided to have dinner at the pyongyang traditional restaurant having missed it when we were in yangon the food is good must try the traditional north korean style cold noodle the decor is typical old style the most unique was the concert put up by none other than the waitresses it was colorful lively n have a mix of traditional n new items watch out for the solo drum performance my favorite it was amazing to watch how the waitresses continue to serve whilst in between their costume changes pricing is relatively high for phnom penh standard but worthwhile for the experience note payment is in cash n they politely request no photos of the concert but u can chat n have photos with the waitresses ,1
a really unique dining experience the beautiful waitresses will take orders and serve you north korean dishes and wala they suddenly dress up and put up several high energy dancing musical instrument singing performances in multiple costumes a lot of effort good food nice show one of a kind outside north korea ,1
i have read about this restaurant and i wanted to go just for my curiosity the result was extremely recommended food is average good but the spectacle even a bit 60 s is great the waitress are at the same time the dancers singers spectacle starts at 19 30 and finished before 21 00 one last advice don t try to give a tip they won t accept it,1
i heard and read quite a few reviews about the restaurant and i finally dropped by with a few friends while in town the restaurant was laid out like a typical chinese restaurant with a stage the waitresses wore light hanbok korean dress and took orders mostly in slightly accented mandarin our waitress eyed us ratherly suspiciously when we spoke in english the menu was filled with an amalgamation of korean and chinese food with the odd dog stew unordered thus unsampled i would say most items are overpriced in this place but you probably already guessed it still the kimchi pancakes and seafood omelette were surprisingly tasty we had a plate of stir fried intestines which was delicious but chewier than old tires slightly disappointed by the lack of north korean beer we had south korean soju instead fancy that the main highlight starts around 730 ish after the first few plates were served the waitresses gave a warm up song and dance distributed bouquets of plastic flowers to each table hell i thought i was given one for being cute a chubby girl sat behind the drums and delivered a heart thumping solo there were dances in traditional costumes look out for the thin but dazzlingly beautiful girl who is the designated spinner her part of the dances include several whirling solo think of a female whirling dervish you would propose marriage to in a heartbeat dragging on into the early evening you would sample 60s karaoke korean songs imagine very tamely dressed korean pop groups a saxophone solo of the moon represents my heart by another gorgeous girl and some more song and dances with electric guitars we caught one girl finger syncing to the music and accordion the national musical instrument for dprk overall the night was enjoyable the food was great and the performance enjoyable and although photography is forbidden during the performance you can still take a shot with the waitress before you leave ,1
first of all i have been here once for lunch and tried pyeongyang style cold sweet potato noodle and fried rice with egg pyeongyang style cold sweet potato noodle ÌèâÏñëÎÉâÎ©¥ was really nice taste for me and i would like to recommend it to all who reads my review there will be two kind of cold sweet potato noodle one is with cool water with some sources and the other do not have cool water i tried cool water style and may be without water will be hot and spicy and my explanation is just for your reference but fried rice with kimchi and egg was a bit hot and spicy it was usual taste like in south korea it was not my taste staffs from pyeongyang was beautiful and kind they served whole time while we finish lunch and i tried not to mention about political issues i wish i visit here again and next time i will see their show in evening time ,1
i went there because it would be one of very few opportunities to meet a north korean while some others have commented that they felt ignored and felt that it might have been because they were from western countries i did not feel that way i felt they were quite friendly especially considering that the place was full and only a handful of girls had to run the entertainment change costumes repeatedly and act as waitresses the girl who played the yanggeum korean dulcimer and the girl who played the drums were amazing if you consider that all the girls could speak korean chinese and at least a little bit of english and could dance and play instrumetns and wait tables well it is truly amazing i was given a bouquet of flowers used during the show at the end by one of the girls although i wasn t able to take it home i have spent a lot of time in south korea and in asia in general and i can speak chinese so maybe i felt less culture shock in general and was able to understand some of what they were saying with other customers they could speak english also some more than others but that was ok because if one could not understand or respond well she could get another the restaurant is connected to the north korean government from what i have read the girls might come from elite families the politics might be distatsteful but a stand alone review should give it a very high rating the girls were very remarkably talented and were friendly the bibimbap was terrific the hors d ouevres were not remarkable but i can t think of any time in my life where i got a show a meal and a cultural experience for 15 dollars including a glass of ginseng wine ,1
north korean style restaurant with good service there are private rooms on second floor with karaoke sing possible ,1
this is a very fun night out with friends even if you aren t into korean food the show is great and the whole experience is so weird and unique it is worth it i usually am not a huge fan of korean food but there were several things on the menu i was surprised i really liked the waitresses are a bit standoffish with westerners and they seated us in back but one did come over to chat briefly and probably see what our deal was the prices are higher than in cambodia we wound up paying 18 per person we were six people but we had a lot of beer and way more food than we could eat then again they don t charge admission so the price includes the performance the performances are delightfully bizarre kids would love it ,1
went here for the show and dinner and in some ways its quite an experience by luck we arrived right before the show food was overpriced but the show was free the food was standard korean cold buckweat noodles sweet and sour pork ribs etc and was pretty decent the show however is the main attraction its bizzare like an 80s japanese pop music performance interspersed with random mini acts the girls sing play mozart on the violin do some traditional dances etc all choreographed to strobe lights and disco balls they pretend to be happy and laugh the whole time but you can tell they are not in fact its known they are basically slaves and going to the restaurant is considered unethical by some so three stars im american and went to see north koreans with my bare eyes one of the servers touched my hand during the meal interesting ,1
the waitresses are also the entertainers and talented entertainers in that they sing they play instruments they entertained us at our table the food is a variety of north korean and chinese so you take your pick the highlight is the entertainment which starts at 730pm so go early if you want to catch this session i don t know if there is one more session later on,1
food wise i would say so so and slightly over priced ordered 7 dishes nothing special with a bottle of soju and cost us more than usd 150 nevertheless people were mainly here for the performances it was weird seeing these young and beautiful north korean ladies performing all kinds of wonderful talents on stage at the same time serving the customers as waitress poor girls ,0
we went for karaoke night which was a live show performed by all the waitresses it was really really fun all of our food was exquisite the drinks were great i highly recommend this place ,1
our last night in phnom penh and our son who lives in the city took us here for our last evening dinner there is a mystery to this place that is hard to figure out the ladies are dressed beautifully and are quite friendly we ordered several dishes stayed away from the meat dishes yes they serve dog it was all very delicious we were the only caucasian people there and it was almost a full audience mostly korean men consuming alot of alcohol and smoking that alone was good entertainment apparently the waitresses entertainment are from north korea and live on the premises and are not allowed to leave it s an odd atmosphere entertainment starts at 7 30 and is excellent definately worth seeing it s not advertised in the city it s by word of mouth that you come across it or by hearing about it from a local felt very safe there dinner was 55 00 for 3 of us including 6 beer however we chose veggie dishes some dishes eg eel was 35 00 a little pricey but worth it to see the show no photos are allowed ,1
this chain was created to generate revenue for the dictatorship in north korea with 25 going directly to the family dynasty that holds power some branches have had to close down because so many of the staff attempted to escape and flee the repressive regime ,1
if there is a pyongyang restaurant in the city i m visiting i eat there the young ladies are extremely talented musicians and dancers and they pretty and nice they may struggle with communication as they do not speak english i spoke to them in my limited mandarin the menu is extensive but many people make the mistake of ordering chinese dishes this mistake will negatively color your experience my recommendation order a large bowl of very special cold pyongyang noodles one per person as these are not sharable and the kim chee you will not be disappointed and you will feel that the meal and entertainment were a tremendous value this is one of those extremely delicious meals i can still taste and dream of having again ,1
if you have a spare evening in phnom penh don t miss a visit to north korea this unusual restaurant serves korean favorites followed by a vivid floorshow operated by a department of the north korean regime the restaurant provides a source of hard currency a venue for propaganda and possibly more nefarious activities that benefit the dprk the large banqueting hall is brightly illuminated and decorated in what might be described as synthetic wedding party the food conveniently pictured in a photo menu was abundant savory and featured barnyard sea and kennel to table yes dog meat korean favorites service provided by attractive young women who also perform was pleasant and fast a necessity considering the imminent start of the show the fifty minute floorshow featured most of the all female wait staff singing dancing and expertly performing on a wide variety of traditional and modern instruments with an ear singeing over amped audio output most of the guests in this busy eatery were korean men but westerners and some families were in attendance communication with the staff is challenging absent korean or khmer and one needs to accept the presence of smokers minders and surveillance was that a camera overhead in the women s toilet ,0
good selection of more exotic dishes like turtle and chicken soup and roast cow s tongue then at 7 30pm the lights go down and there is a musical dancing extravaganza that the glorious leader would be proud of ,1
cold ramen is tasty a lil different than what i had in seoul bbq pork was ok worth visiting if you have time performance was ok most of the attendees were men service wise was so so waitress only able to chat after performance finished some can speak mandarin too ,1
being a south korean living in america i was a bit hesitant to eat here but my wife insisted it was my first time meeting north koreans and it was equally unnerving and exciting at the same time they don t speak english so we ordered in korean they speak much differently than south koreans but it s understandable the cold noodle soup they call it rengmyun was really good and made the authentic old fashioned way without any artificial ingredients liks msg they asked us about life in america and once my wife got to talking they wouldn t leave our tableside in fact 2 of them stayed by our table for the entire meal which gave me a bit of indigestion they were obviously curious in the end it was a unique experience that i couldn t have at home and that was worth the price which is more typical of what you d pay in america for this kind of meal as we were there for lunch we did not get to see the live show but i hear it s pretty good we did hear a couple of the servers practicing their songs for later that evening and it was awkwardly entertaining ,1
we joke about going to this place and having stone stoup and rice husk gravel as a starving north korean its a bright an airy room staffed with young nk women who are clearly living a better life than at at home don t think for a minute that this a social enterprise just a way for the nk gov t to get some exposure and money food was plentiful and well prepared if you like vats of kimchee with everything each of the serving staff participated in the show which ranged from surreal to cheesy to actually ok the korean zither player ,1
this restaurant isn t somewhere you d go particularly for the food it s really all about the experience it s more of a bizarre banquet hall with live shows every night alternating between rock shows and traditional dancing enjoying a beer while watching a 20 year old north korean girl rocking out to a manic drum solo is priceless also priceless is trying to convince the staff who are all the chosen few who get to leave north korea for the green pastures of cambodia that they should pop to an internet cafe on their lunch break and explore the wonderful world of google ,1
typical n korean food including cold noodles great place if you want to see a bit of north korea however the show had a bit too much chinese songs compare to korean ones ,0
we read the reviews and thought this would be an interesting experience well it certainly was we arrived early as advised and there was no one else there 4 waitresses came over with menus and stood around us waiting for our order none of them seemed to speak english and watched over us for a good 20 mins while we tried to work out the menu lots of variety but prices quite high a lot of large groups started to arrive and we got our food before the floor show began food was nothing special but the show was quite good seemed to be a lot of business men there leering at the waitresses and lots of smokers probably wouldn t bother going again there s plenty of better restaurants to visit in town also when we got the bill there was no card facilities luckily we had enough cash on hand to pay ,0
i took four friends to pyongyang restaurant for a birthday celebration and we had a great time the food was spicy and good and the show was excellent the women are talented and put on a great musical it was my friend s birthday and the waitresses led all the patrons in happy birthday and have him flowers it was a great evening and worth the money ,1
went here for dinner hoping it was the night they also did the performances but alas no show on a tuesday night atmosphere was filled will smoke and and mirrors literally mirrors all over the walls and everyone smoking so if that s your thing you re in for a treat food was good though i admit i played it safe and got a noodle dish the waitress brought over a phone book sized menu then stood right next to me while i perused it under pressure lolz i would go back if i were sure to catch the performance but otherwise take a pass ,1
