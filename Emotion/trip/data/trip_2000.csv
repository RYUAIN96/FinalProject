0,Traveltubbies,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,An interesting introduction to North Korean food,"Our first dining experience in a North Korean restaurant, totally run and operated by women folks from North Korea. If you are there for dinner, you could get to enjoy the performances - traditional and modern from waitresses that double up as performers. Waitresses were friendly and despite the fact that they have to multi-task, did not slow down the service.

The whole experience was quite strange. Food wise, that's not too bad at all but I would not return just for the food and the performance. Once is good enough.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
1,WilliamBaek,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,Great Taste,"It was my first meal in North Korean restaurant.
Comparing to similar Korea food restaurant, the interior is simpler and atmosphere is rather nothing special. However, the food was great.
I ordered ""So Yukgejang"", spicy beef soup with a bowl of rice and the taste was one of the best for such soups.
I was alone there for my lunch but was served by two beautiful ladies though out the meal and it was pleasant experienced to chat with various topics with North Koreans.
Highly recommended to try food there and have a chat with them.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
2,n0butakai,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,Typical North Korean restaurant for non-Korean,"Food are generally good. Tried lunch-Bulkogi-grilled beef and Reimen-cold noodle, which were not bad, or could say even better than expected. Reasonably priced. Served by beautiful waitressesabout, most probably selected ones, who
spoke English and/or Japanese. Rather strange setting, many long and big tables, mainly for group guests. Better ask for a smaller table.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
3,Lai Yoke L,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,Worth a visit,"Food is generally good. Worth mentioning are kImchi which is mild spicy version, chewy tasty stirred fried beef & excellent scallop; & not forgetting the spicy taufu soup. The waitresses dressed in Korean traditional dresses will go up the stage for musical performance around 8 pm, which is kinda interesting.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
4,hanneetan,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,Good food in a very bizarre atmosphere,"We've passed by the place a couple times and were always curious about what goes on inside and what North Korean cuisine is about. When our friends came for a visit, we thought what better way to entertain them after reading the reviews online.

Food was really really delicious. The fried sesame leaves were a surprise. We love the topoki (rice cake), kimchi and especially this cold pork slices dish.

We were late for the show and yes, our waitress too left us midway service and hopped on the stage to perform. Show starts at 7:30pm every nite. It was a hoot just watching the whole fanfare but we had a tonne of fun. The only drag about the place was the chain smoking customers. Will we be back? Maybe when we have friends in town to entertain.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
5,housewifelet,Pyongyang Restaurant,1.0,retro in a bad way,"This restaurant is like the setting of a 60s Bond movie. Food overpriced and too spicy for my sensitive palette. Waitresses creepy and unfriendly, only smiling when presenting the bill. An alienating experience. Was so hungry after, had to buy so.e dumplings from a roadside stand .","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
6,CathieKSA,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Food with Entertainment,"Be sure to try the fried sesame leaves. Food was good, and at 8:00 a dancing and singing show started. It lasted about 35 minutes. I had expected propaganda because I heard there would be some, but there was not. Table service was OK but not great -- a bit difficult to get our waitress's attention.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
7,Robert T,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,A second degree kitsch experience,We had a feeling of North Korea for the evening. The food is honest and good and generously served. The waitresses are North Korean and they propose a stage performance which is taking you in another world and time. Definitely a place to stop by when you are in Phnom Penh,"['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
8,Z R,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,Authentic North Korean style,"I have been to several North Korean restaurants in several cities, they are pretty similar in many ways. Nothing special if you have been to a North Korean restaurant, but if you are familiar with the Korean food often seen in South Korea, some dishes with the same names are worth tasting. North Koreans make kimchi with a different way, very unique. Not the best place if you expect a conversation with your friends, because their music is loud and are the reason a lot of people going there for, and who knows what the waitresses would do when they hear what you are talking about, they all speak Khmer, English and apparently Korean very well.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
9,Enemalm,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,A very strange place,"In the middle of Phnom Penh you'll find this strange place. The waitresses - all very beautiful and look exactly the same - are sent here from North Korea and stay for about three years. The purpose: to ""inform"" us about how fantastic there home country is.

The food was quite good, actually not so different from Cambodian food, but we avoided dog and some other strange dishes.

At 7.30 (this was on a Friday) the show started. All of a sudden our waitresses stopped serving food and got on stage. They danced something that reminded me of Sound of Music. And then they sang Honey, honey (Abba) and one of the played the violin good enough to get a job in any simphony orchestra. In the end they picked up three electric guitars and played.

The whole show was just so bizarre that we sat laughing all the time. We brought our three children and they didn't like the food so much but enjoyed the show.

Of course, you should not support the regime of North Korea. I feel a bit ashamed about it, but it really was an interesting experience.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
10,sahast,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Unique...,Frequent this unique place... tasty north korean food accompanied by the performance of waitresses... a musical dinner.. a must to visit...,"['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
11,foursix_nine,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,Rare North Korean experience,"I never thought that I'd be getting any sort of north Korean experience while I was in Cambodia. But it's like a buy one get one, fly to Cambodia, and see North Korea! They show was amazing, I enjoyed it a lot, I was totally awed by the way they spun and twirled, and the many many instruments that could play! They don't allow you to take pictures inside, but they won't ask you to delete your photos either once you get your chance to. The food was okay, but just order a simple dish or something and just enjoy the show!","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
12,Ilin C,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,"Interesting experience, good food, but not as freaky as otherwise thought","Heard a lot about this place. One of our visitors said was his favorite restaurants in Phnom Penh--could not wait to try it. It was interesting and unusual from a Western perspective, but definitely not as freaky as others might think. The food was good, not the best Korean food I have ever had (had North Korean food in Seoul which was better). The pork ribs and bimbimbap at a hot stove pot was pretty good. The dumpling and the vegetable dish were nothing to write home about. The waitresses were definitely quite talented, well-dressed and well-groomed. My friends thought they look angry from time to time--they were a bit stressed since they had to wait on all customers and to perform as well. Don't expect that they will come by to chat with you. The waitresses and the show definitely were trying to reinforce the traditional expectation of women being very thin, submissive and gentle. No wonder most of the patrons there tonight were males. Who knows how much of the show were truly north Korean or modified to feed a particular expectation? The restaurant is closed by 9 pm which I did not expect. Overall not very memorable, food was only alright--would not likely go back as the place did allow smoking which always put a big dent on the overall dining experience.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
13,The_Nomadic_Doctor,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,The ultimate freak show!!,"I have seen and eaten at many freaky restaurants in Africa and Asia, but this is restaurant is a different ball game altogether. It felt like I was in a place meant for North Korean propaganda and that experience alone deserves five stars.

Food is decent. Yes, there is dog meat if you want to try it. There is a limited beer selection.

But the best part of the restaurant is the waitresses and the videos. All waitresses are made to look like dolls and perform in between serving your food. Expect anything from a covering of Celine Dion to hardcore rock music. My waitresses hurriedly dropped food at my table and rushed to get on stage. It was quite the spectacle. And then there are the videos. Lush landscapes and beaches, which I assume are meant to project N.Korea is a good light.

Definitely visit if you are in the area.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
14,fauziah z,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,Unique Experience of North Korean Restaurant,"The food quality is excellent. But more interestingly is the multi-talented waitress. They were wearing similar dress, and they are very beautiful. These waitress serve dishes for you and then they skillfully perform sing, dance, and play band! Amazing.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
15,bakupaku,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Ought to try it....,"This restaurant is at the main road of Monivong Bld. We were sceptical after reading the reviews n possible motives behind it, however we decided to try it since we will never visit Pyongyang. Yes,all the waitresses are dressed in yellow n red chiffon hanbok,same shoes,same scrunchy n similar hairstyle etc. They are soft-spoken, pretty n friendly with the Korean guests. The food is rather similar to South Korean's,or it's just those dishes that we ordered. The kimchi with pork ($8) was good, not sour or too oily. The dog soup ($12) is probably an acquired taste, with lots of spice n some chilli. The boiled mackerel fish ($10) is yummy for fish lovers. Jinro Soju is a tad too expensive for our liking, at $6. The performance starts at 8pm, with the waitresses singing, dancing n playing guitar, drum, keyboard n gu zheng! Very impressive! Definitely worth a visit for the curious, but pls bear with those ppl smoking in the air-conditioned restaurant.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
16,3030orthereabouts,Pyongyang Restaurant,1.0,Do you like funding North Korea's elite?,"This whole series of restaurants serve as nothing but a cash collector for the NK government. If you don't mind that...

Get the dog stew, it was pretty good. In fact all the food was pretty good. It's expensive for PP but then again you are paying for the Hennesey drinking habits of an entire country's plutocracy.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
17,ozinmilan,Pyongyang Restaurant,1.0,Don't bother,"Avoid Avoid Avoid
The service received (or lack of) was disgraceful.. it was the worst I have ever received in any restaurant in the world.
After being made to feel extremely uncomfortable, we walked out not ordering anything, vowing never to return again ....
Do not bother spending your money and your time there. Plenty of other restaurants in Phnom Penh to choose from where you are treated with respect and courtesy, something this restaurant lacks","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
18,ruo,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,Great show and good food!,"This is a restaurant that is definitely worth a visit. Heard from a friend that it is one of the only two North Korean restaurants that is not in North Korea. Food there is on the expensive side (cost us USD 34 for a stir fried pork, dumplings, kimchi soup, beef fried rice and drinks), but the show in itself is worth it! Food was pretty good as well!

The show consists of a series of dancing, singing and percussion. It starts at 8pm, so you may want to go slightly earlier to have your dinner and concentrate on the show when it starts. You are also not allowed to take pictures.

We went at about 8pm when the staff are preparing for the show and they looked a bit flustered and service was a little rude. However, this changed completely after the show and they were really friendly and asking whether you enjoyed the food and the show.

Highly recommended place!!!! Most tuk tuk drivers should know where it is so it should not be difficult to get there!","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
19,MikeFrommer,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Wacky yet strangely enthralling,"If you don't mind propping up the North Korean regime then take a visit to Pyongyand, probably the closest to North Korea you will ever get. In line with other reviewers very bizarre to see the waitresses suddenly performing rousing songs on stage. Also had to chuckle when we saw stewed dog on the menu - no we did not order it!","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
20,MrsSoT,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,Words fail me...,"This is the restaurant equivalent of smoking DMT. You do it once and appreciate the experience and then never do it again because you fear for your mental health. I felt really wierd being there as its like supporting the North Korean Government who didn't get this well known by being happy fluffy hippies. The waitresses are cold and unsmiling (only my male mates were too impressed by them to tell. Hand picked apparently...). After half an hour of kimchi and incredibly expensive beer, they launched into this colourful, whirling, screeching show with ""happy"" smiling faces for the best part of an hour before going back to being grim and austere again. The place has the weirdest vibe of anywhere I've ever been. There wasn't much after dinner banter. I think we were all in a little shock. Like I said, it was a great experience and I'm glad I went but wow. Would I go back? Maybe just once...","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
21,MonchichiCairns,Pyongyang Restaurant,2.0,Lost for words,"Sitting down and reading the rather high prices on the menu at this restaurant I figured I must be missing something. The large, unattractive, brightly lit room was full of customers. The service was sporadically slow and unfriendly. The food was nothing to write home about.
Which left me scratching my head, why were there some many people here?
And then it happened.
The lights were dimmed as images of serene forests and waterfalls looped on the flat screen TV. A piano accordion suddenly appeared and the waitresses began singing. There were fake bouquets of flowers, costumes resembling the ugly duckling after she grew into a beautiful swan, heart shaped maracas, mostly North Korean karaoke songs and a random version of 'On Top Of The World' by the Carpenters. The highlight was the waitresses rocking out on electric guitar, bass guitar and a drum solo.
Yes it was overpriced. Yes it was extremely weird. Yes I would never go back, but without a doubt, I will never forget it.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
22,woodsmen_11,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,What a dinner and a show,"This is another one of those best kept secrets. Firstly as a westerner you will feel like the only person there, you will be, the place is full of Koreans and some other Asian nationalities. The place is brightly lighten. The menu was interesting, guess there is no real difference between South Korean and North Korean cuisine, either that or we did try some of the more unique offerings. The waitresses are a highlight, wearing very bright almost brides dresses, they are very friendly and speak perfect English........BUT then......they double as the cast of the most fantastic restaurant show I have seen. Loads of fun and just a overall great experience. Go experience, you will not be disappointed. An absolute treat.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
23,EurasieTravelAsia,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,"She can be waitress, singer and....","If you look for quiet place I guess it is not the right place for you, since they have live music, smoking, speaking loudly (Korean and Chinese).

What impressed me a lot is waitress there she play as many role. She can be waitress, singer, instrument. When is the time, most of waitress will be on stage, sing, dance.....","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
24,FnBinPP,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,North Korean cultural centre,"If you fancy Korean food in phnom penh this is the place. Decent food in aircon but a must see floor show (about 7pm). All singing, all dancing north Korean culture and propaganda! Top value entertainment on the quirky scale!","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
25,alicenguyenz,Miss Korea,3.0,Average food at expensive prices - not authentic Korean food,"If you truly want to get a taste of what authentic Korean food taste like, I would not recommend Miss Korea.

Average food at the expensive prices. I praise for the menu tho as it has a good variety of choices between side dishes, chicken, seafood, beef etc. I believe the most proud dish of the restaurant of the BBQ, however I personally think the dish is over priced for the under seasoning meat, little proportion on the dish.

Nevertheless, I do recommend to order Tteokbokki ( Korean rice cake) and the rice dishes as they are quite delicious and easy to eat.",['samgyeopsal'],1
26,Andythebaggie,Miss Korea,4.0,Decent and good value Korean BBQ,"Popped in on spec during Chinese New Year celebrations, so there was a bit of a wait for a table. We do enjoy Korean bbq, first we ordered vegetable Goyza whilst waiting for the bbq to warm up. We then had a selection of dishes, beef in beer, chicken, mushrooms, spuds etc along with lettuce, rice and chilli and garlic for me to give the meal an extra kick. The dishes did come out rather haphazardly, indeed the potatoes which took the longest to cook came out last. House wine is great value at around £13 a bottle, there’s beer to inc. Hite if you want something Korean. Service is slightly random, though tbf it was very busy when we arrived. Food is good though, and overall we certainly enjoyed our meal. And at £50 excl service it’s good value. Btw it’s cash only here (plenty of cash points nearby).",['samgyeopsal'],1
27,xlavayukix,Miss Korea,4.0,Flavorful and authentic Korean food,"I came here twice so far and love the food, Miss Korea is a real authentic Korean restaurant with BBQ plates on the table and a huge menu of everything from kimchi pancakes, bibimbap and a variety of jigae to BBQ meat and seafood, grilled and fried dishes plus a full vegetarian menu. The quality of food here is excellent and they’re kimchi is the best I’ve ever had in terms of UK Korean restaurants, the portions are big and the prices are cheap; mains are around £8-9, starters are around £5 each. The service is basic at best, the staff are efficient but not too attentive. They also do not accept card so it’s cash only, which is a downside. I loved the seafood bibimbap and spicy tofu jigae, both tasted divine. Overall high quality flavorful and authentic Korean food, cheap prices, generous portions but average service.",['samgyeopsal'],1

31,910minhh,Miss Korea,5.0,Exceptional food excellent service,"Having been to many korean restaurants in the UK (mainly London), I can say without a doubt that this one is the best for food, service is good and the setting is nice.

35,Dave G,Miss Korea,3.0,Double Edged Sword,"So, rocked up here last night with family and friends for my birthday.

Me - ""Hi, have a table booked for 8 at 7""

Them - ""errrrr....?""

That was kind of the way the rest of the night went.

Drinks order took over 20 mins to arrive.

Waitress to order the food took as long again to come over.

Then better part of an hour wait for anything.

My meal came, out, everyone else got left waiting. Had to go up twice to chase up everyone elses food. Must have been at least another 20 mins before some of theirs came. I had long finished before the 2 katsu curerys came at the end.

Ill give them their dues, they were very apologetic and threw in a couple of rounds of drinks and some food to try and appease things, which softened the blow a little.

The food though, was really really good. Bitter sweet really. Bursting with flavours, cooked to perfection and well presented. No one had anything other than beaming smiles they tucked in and it was clean plates all round. Not a bad word to say about that.

Just a shame that the service was soooo bad. If you dont mind spending 4hrs in a restaurant feeling like no one cares about your experience, the food is .ore than worth it xx",['samgyeopsal'],0
36,pringlePlymouth,Miss Korea,1.0,"Terrible service, cold food, long wait for food.","We have never tried Korean food so were looking forward to tasting something different.
We were greated and seated quickly and then informed they only accept cash, i wonder why that is??
The service was terrible, staff who couldn't care less. The food came out in dribs and srabs over 15 minutes. Mains first and then 15 mins later the rice. Useless.
I wouldn't recommend Miss Korea ever.",['samgyeopsal'],0
37,pang l,Miss Korea,5.0,korean food,I really enjoyed this place. I went there with my Korean friend. Totally affordable and genuine food. Relaxed atmosphere! We spent £28 in total,['samgyeopsal'],1
38,The-Midlander,Miss Korea,4.0,Decent Addition to Birmingham’s Asian Quarter,"Decent Korean food. Service is ok - seems like a fairly new restauranteur team, so some of the sequencing was a bit off.
For example we ordered 2 starters, but one came after we’d started the main course, so we sent it back. And my wife’s main course came a few minutes after mine, which we had to flag.
However the team of waitresses were well dressed, and couldn’t do enough to help once they had realised their mistake.
So overall, decent food, a friendly restaurant team. They just need to improve some of their sequencing.
Overall Miss Korea is a good edition to Birmingham’s burgeoning Asian restaurant quarter.",['samgyeopsal'],1
39,Sophia7758,Miss Korea,5.0,Amazing food and great customer service,"Went to Miss Korea with my friend today. We had BBQ between two of us.

Very few bbqs actually worked, the food was honestly slightly dodgy ( although their veggie kimchi pancake and tofu were lovely but then again quite expensive for what they were ), the staff were rude and slow (only two tables were busy), and you cant pay with card. I had a really hot soup which was served with a metal spoon and burnt my tongue massively.",['samgyeopsal'],0

46,ningl2019,Miss Korea,1.0,SO RUDE SERVICE,"”YOU GUYS ARE STUPID” THAT IS WHAT YOU SAID!!!!!
I had heard excellent things about this place but the experience I had today was the complete opposite!!! First of all, the one waitress at the place was absolutely rude, she had the worst scowl on her face and had kept pinning everything she did wrong on somebody who had little English skills as we had previously mentioned to the woman. She had ‘misheard’ one of the orders (which to me when she was taking the orders looked like she didn’t give a flying toss). When we explained she got the order wrong she gave us the dirtiest look and told us we were wrong and spent 30 minutes trying to get us to eat something we did not order and when we finally received what we had originally ordered it was once again not the right food! We had pointed specifically to braised chicken bulgogi with bbq sauce which we pointed at the photo which we revived a dish which we did not order. After finishing the food we received the bill and split it between 7 of us and 2 of the girls left shortly after. As soon as the girls had left the waitresses came over to tell us that they messed the bill up and it went from £78 to £85 which I must say we are 15 and some of us do not have a lot of money and would have helped if they could have told us before the girls had left. So overall I will not be re visiting and I do not recommend going there!!!",['samgyeopsal'],0
47,dk092014,Miss Korea,2.0,Poor experience,"The food was slightly below average. The service is as bad as it can get. It's a wonder how they are still open but then again it's cash only.. so maybe someone is forgetting to declare their taxes.

48,NickSFCB,Miss Korea,4.0,Excellent Korean food,"We ate in here for the 1st time on a Monday night. The restaurant was very busy and has a great ambiance. The servers were all friendly and the food is excellent. to start with we had the chicken Kangpopi, which was larger enough to have been a main course. The sauce was very good, not too spicy, but had enough flavour. For my main course, I had the Chicken katsu. Again this was very good, the chicken was well cooked and the curry sauce was great, the sticky rice was also brilliant. My wife had a beef dish. Which she enjoyed and was well cooked. This was my first visit to Miss Korea and will not be my last.
For a starter, 2 mains a soft drink and 1 glass of wine, the total was £34, which is excellent value.",['samgyeopsal'],1
49,Xela_02_87,Miss Korea,4.0,Lovely meal,"Good was lovely. Drinks were served quickly. Food not so quickly. Waitress service wasn't the best, seemingly too rushed off their feet to be too friendly or offer any menu guidance etc. We have eaten korean bbq before but they should really assume that and should take the time to offer to assist new clientele. We ordered squid beef and spicy pork with sides for the bbq. Everything was lovely and fresh. Staff were attentive at keeping an eye on bbq temperature and replacing the grease proof paper laid over the bbq though. I would recommend but maybe not for ppl trying korean for the first time.",['samgyeopsal'],1
50,RekhaC61,Miss Korea,3.0,Different,Went with my husband and 13 year old son. It was a good pleasant atmosphere. Service a bit slow as low on waiting staff. Steak was very good. Ox tongue and belly pork was not pleasant. Chicken was average.,['samgyeopsal'],0
51,glynb326,Miss Korea,3.0,Popular with large groups,"I’ve been there with friends 3 times and trust their advice on what to eat as menu is complex and difficult to use. The food is tasty and there is certainly no rush to take orders, deliver food and drink and to bring the bill. On each occasion, there have been lots of Chinese and/or Korean customers so this must mean they’re doing something right. Remember to take cash as they don’t accept card payments.",['samgyeopsal'],1

This was our second visit and both times it was outstanding. Everything we had was fresh, the staff were very helpful and polite. I would highly recommend this restaurant if your willing to have a go at cooking some things yourself, it’s fun, and a must try for anyone who likes something different. For people who don’t want the BBQ there’s enough choice on the menu. Reasonably priced too. Excellent. Can’t wait to come back",['samgyeopsal'],1
54,Jes1000jes,Miss Korea,1.0,"Disappointing experience, awful service","Went to try this restaurant the very first time but they successfully made us not to return. The Cash Only restaurant which you will be told when you sit down and of course again and again afterward. It was quick when order the food but long waiting time after that - you need to be patience and not too hungry so keep chatting or bring a book. Food was a bit disappointed. Frozen meat was served for BBQ - maybe it is ok??

Vegetables were not fresh. Food portion is small. We ordered a Kimchi fire rice as we love kimchi but it was so hard to dig out some kimchi and can hardly see the pork. Service was awful - all waitresses may had a super hard day. One of them turned off our BBQ cooker suddenly without even said a word when we still have meats on there.

Not a good experience, very disappointed.",['samgyeopsal'],0
55,N8167AUrichardp,Miss Korea,2.0,"Terrible service, average Korean food","I was excited to try this place for the Korean BBQ having wandered past a few weeks before. The welcome we received should have given some warning signs of the experience we’d receive - on arrival it took five minutes for the staff to acknowledge us. At which point we were asked to wait for a table. This was fine - however we then sat for 30 minutes before being shown to a table which was vacant when we had arrived half an hour prior.

We’d browsed the menu whilst waiting so were ready to order, but had to wait another 20 minutes to place our order - successive staff members telling us there was only one member of staff ‘who could take orders’. Whilst ordering we were then informed that the restaurant was cash only, so I had to wander to the local Tesco to get enough cash to cover the meal. A 20 minute wait at a busy cashpoint was not ideal but made little difference as our food took a good 45 minutes to arrive anyway.

I love a seafood pajeon (pancake) - this was the first of our order served, the Miss Korea version was unusually heavy and relatively tasteless. A disappointing start. Our bbq options then arrived - this was better, a good portion of pork belly which we struggled to finish. The experience however was affected again by the service. A surly member of staff repeatedly messing with the temperature controls without explanation and removing all food on the bbq to a plate again without explanation (it turns out to replace the grease proof paper on the grill). We also had to ask at least five times to have a glass of tap water delivered to the table - it eventually arriving at the end of the meal.

Overall a very disappointing experience, I don’t think we’ll be back - the food a pale imitation of decent Korean cuisine and some of the worst service I’ve received for a while.",['samgyeopsal'],0
56,Flyer53864362401,Miss Korea,1.0,Would’ve been to korea and back in the time we waited,It took 45 minutes for them to serve us. Never coming back. Food quality didn’t make up for the wait either.,['samgyeopsal'],0
57,Rennie H,Miss Korea,5.0,Loving it,"Amazing service. The waiters were absolutely lovely. It looked great and the dishes were really tasty. The Kimchi pancake was the best I have ever tried. We also enjoyed the tteokbokki and the bulgoki. The bibimbap was slightly disappointing, but the overall experience was brilliant. Also, nice music.",['samgyeopsal'],1

60,Passport813659,Miss Korea,2.0,Disappointed...,"I'm a korean, but I wasn't able to feel korean food in this restaurant. I think the owner is a chines, so the taste towards more on chines style than original korean. I had soybean paste stew and Bibimbab. The stew was so salty and less ingredient, I think if they put more tofu or other vegetables in the stew, it would be better. And my friend said the Bibimbab has to much rice and less vegetables and meats. Maybe, I can make better dishes than this restaurant. Also, I don't know why they are only available cash. I had to withdraw money from near ATM...

버밍엄에 한식당이 많이 없어서 기대 했는데 종업원들도 중국인이고, 한식을 잘하는 식당은 아닌것 같습니다. 된장찌개가 짠맛밖에 없어요. 비빔밥은 찌개보다 먹을만한데 같이 간 친구는 밥을 정말 많이 남겼어요.",['samgyeopsal'],1

65,zelvmarcelo,Miss Korea,3.0,Foods are nice but service needs improvement,"I’ve always eaten here because I like the ambience of the restaurant. It looks way better than typical restaurant in most China town. I’ve also always loved eating Korean foods so no matter which restaurant I order it from I’m still gonna like it. However, the staff needs more training as they all seemed to be young student girls with no experience in customer service. Once you have your food on your table they don’t ask you anymore whether everything is okay or not. One time I had to call the attention of the waitress for 3 times and she still didn’t come to our table because they were busy (showed they were short of staff too and can’t handle busy shifts). I saw the manager (I assume she is) lowkey telling off the waitress when she didn’t know the name of the food she was serving. There were times too when the food order took so long to arrive on the table and not at the same time. They’ll bring one after the other! (Again, it showed slow service from the kitchen). Like I said I love Korean foods but the service in this restaurant needs improvement. Oh, i was surprised when i saw that they charge you for service charge when you don’t get the service you deserve to get anyway.",['samgyeopsal'],1
66,DayTrip760172,Miss Korea,1.0,No go,"Was taken for a mother's day meal. What a meal if was we waited at least after hour before being dealt with. Was told we would need to pay by cash despite seeing others pay with card. We ordered drinks before my daughter went to the cash point I waited and the staff served the other familes arounf us despite us being seated first, did not want to bring the drinks out until she was back it was across the road in view of the restaurant. The food it's self over cooked tough, under seasoned and plain tasting. Was not enjoyable at all. The service was appalling it was like we was a burden to them the it was a shambles out starters we were brought one starter out of 3 and it took another 25mins before it was received. We had our mains before our starter arrived. Ended up just paying for what was ordered and leaving. Still hungry, disappointed.",['samgyeopsal'],0
67,helenLibra,Miss Korea,3.0,BBQ is amazing!,Fresh meat you can bbq yourself on your table! I would say the only problem with this place is they accept cash only!,['samgyeopsal'],0
68,zoegreviews,Miss Korea,4.0,"Reasonable, if a little Anglicised","Tucked in a corner of Chinatown, this little slice of Korea was almost empty when we arrived at 12:15. The waitress was swift to warn us that they were cash only but luckily there was a cash point in the Tesco express just up the road.

By 12:45, the place had filled with chatter; even the large banquet table down the middle was full. Reassuringly, the majority of diners were Korean and we were only 1 of two tables with Westerners on it. The menu was all in English and the waitresses were quick to take our orders and very helpful.

We ordered samgyupsal(belly pork) bbq, soy bean soup and kimchijeon (kimchi pancake). The kimchijeon came first, unusually it seemed to have been deep-fat fried and so had a slightly crisp coating but still tasted quite good. The soy bean soup was good though a little low on chillies. The samgyupsal was somewhat disappointing - rather than the thick meaty strips of the home country, this was more reminiscent of bacon; thin and overly fatty. Despite that, it was an enjoyable meal, coming to £32.00 for the three dishes plus sides and drinks. Is certainly go back to see how the other food compares!",['samgyeopsal'],1
69,Lelly61,Miss Korea,3.0,First visit.,"Visited today with family, Attended Chinese New year celebrations. Short wait for table. One member of staff very helpful. Not had Korean food before.

73,SairaBe,Miss Korea,3.0,Mixed feelings,"Reception was okay and they were very helpful. Not sure if this was because it was a Sunday but I am old and experienced enough to know my good was heated and not cooked fresh. My husband had a bibimbap which looked fresh and maybe should have ordered that.
Was recommended miss Korea by a colleague and this place is nothing to write home about. Sorry!",['samgyeopsal'],0
74,Salma-Ben,Miss Korea,4.0,Very good,"The food was fresh, good value and really tasty. The restaurant is on the edge of China Town. It is clean, tidy and pleasant. Waitress was friendly, polite and attentive. It has a car park directly opposite.",['samgyeopsal'],1

76,Natty P,Miss Korea,4.0,Satisfying and delicious!,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday and had a great meal. Between the two of us we tried the pork gyozas, and basically had the BBQ. We chose the beer lamb, BBQ beef and the beef ribs. All very tender once on the BBQ, the ribs were a bit chewy though. Our bill came to around £40 and included two bowls of rice and some soft drinks. Overall, highly recommended if you're a beginner to Korean food. The only downside is that the ventilation isn't great so you do end up smelling like your food!",['samgyeopsal'],1
77,drcmlin,Miss Korea,1.0,Poor service,"Poor service, staff cannot manage. Waited a long time to order in spite of calling out to staff. Apparently there is only one staff who can take order.

Needless to say we walked out. There are other Korean places to eat in Birmingham. Avoid.",['samgyeopsal'],0
78,EstherZeng,Miss Korea,3.0,Restaurant with mixed blessing,Their pork BBQs are tender and delicious. But I really don't like the fact that we have to order extra for lettuces because lettuces are complimentary for Korean BBQ in most restaurants I have visited. Side dishes have to order separately and not free. Kimchi soup came with complimentary rice bowl though. The taste of other foods are quite okay but not as good as the one I went at Manchester. The decoration is nice and the staff is friendly. Only cash is accepted.,['samgyeopsal'],1

81,busymum001,Miss Korea,4.0,Nice for a change,We wanted to go somewhere different as a family for Father's Day lunch and a friend recommended here. I always read reviews beforehand and so we knew about the cash situation and that service tended to be slow. We got there when it opened at noon and so service was not at all slow. We were the only customers for a while. It gave us time to ask lots of questions about the food and the numerous options. Two of us chose the cook yourself BBQ option and two had terryaki dishes. The beef terryaki was delicious and it was a novelty to cook on the grill. The rest of the food was good verging on ok. We didn't appreciate the additional 'tax' added onto the bill but had been very happy with our young waitress and the service she provided. Probably won't rush back but wouldn't rule it out either,['samgyeopsal'],0
82,Junehope,Miss Korea,1.0,Disappointed and pricey !!!!,"Accept cash only, long waiting time, pricey compared to other Korean restaurant nearby , no ventilation at the shop
Bad customer service, we asked whether we could change our seating area cause the sun keep facing at my seating area. Been refused and no apologies.

We were so disappointed with this simple request as there were still plenty of seating table available at that time. We have to end up take away all our foods and went to somewhere else to have our dinner!!!

Would not recommend and would not ever go there again!!!",['samgyeopsal'],0
83,Tomandli,Miss Korea,4.0,Different cuisine to try!,"Me and a friend were feeling adventurous in trying out a new cuisine. We passed Miss Korea as an off chance. Thought we would try it. First up was the Korean tea...............very much an acquired taste too 'woody' for me. We ordered an appetizer to share (Belly Pork with Kimchi) which was rather a large dish. I felt it would have been better served with rice or noodles as it had a rich salty/ spicy taste to eat alone. The main courses were chicken Bibimbap and Seafood Udon Noodles. Both dishes were very tasty and filling. The bibimbap was an unusual dish as it is a very hot stone/ clay pot with rice at the bottom topped by vegetables and meat of your choice then a raw egg. The idea is to mix it all together before you eat it. Almost as if you are stir frying the dish!

Our waitress was very helpful and informative about the dishes we asked about. The downside was CASH only which we did not know until we asked for the bill.",['samgyeopsal'],1
84,Elmo1989_03,Miss Korea,5.0,Yummy,Korean food seems to becoming more and more fashionable these days. I especially like how there are so many vegetarian/vegan options on offer at this restaurant and it was very clean and comfortable. The toilets are fun - a cat meows whenever you open the door! This type of quirkiness is what makes South East Asia so fascinating. My tofu was fantastic and just spicy enough. Staff were so cute and smiley too. We were the only white people in there which is a testament to how authentic this place is. We would definitely return the next time we are in Birmingham especially as the Hippodrome theatre is down the road.,['samgyeopsal'],1
85,leroyy541,Miss Korea,5.0,Korean food is the most unrated Asian food in Asia,"I been coming to Miss Korea restaurant since late 2013 and every single time that I come here the food is consistent the standards are high the staff is friendly as well as helpful, there isn't much korean restaurants in Birmingham England this is a treat who want to try something different other than Chinese Japanese Indian or Thai food korean kimchi stew is very healthy kimchi itself is one of the healthiest foods on earth it based on fermentation of different vegetables the most popular one is with cabbage.",['samgyeopsal'],1
86,LVCICI,Miss Korea,5.0,Birthday,Celebrated my birthday here. There was 20 of us. Seated just fine. Only one lady server initially then the second lady came after an hour. Fantastic service and food is served excellently. Will definitely come back again. Price is a bit high but went with great satisfaction.,['samgyeopsal'],1
87,CIsip,Miss Korea,1.0,I'd rate it zero if I could,"Bad food, even worse service. They only take cash due to evading tax probably. Ordered a lamb meal and it tasted gross. I barely touched it so I complained to the waitress and she could not speak much English and apologised but kept checking with the owner what they could do and all they could offer was 15% off our bill which is a complete rip off as my food arrived 30 mins after my friend has had his food. No apologies about this whatsoever. After a while, the owner came out very rude and arrogant saying they do not care if we don't like the taste of the food as to them it tastes okay. They tasted my leftovers as well. Wtf. Horrible experience. I will not be coming back ever. Probably will put a formal complaint as well after how we were treated.",['samgyeopsal'],0
88,FoodyReviewer,Miss Korea,3.0,Great if you have these expectations...,"1) lots of people seated = extremely slow service. It isn't bad, it is just slow. Once seated, wait 5-10 minutes for drinks order. Wait for drinks 5-10 minutes. Another 15-20 minutes wait for food order. Raw/BBQ yourself orders, will obviously get theirs quicker. Possibly another 25-30 minutes additional wait for the cooked food. We opted for all cooked, so first 2 people ate theirs whilst other 2 watched, once finished, still a wait before the other 2 people were even served.

2) food was tasty and portions we thought were good

3) cash only

4) there are separate booths and tables for 4, the row of tables down the centre all squeezed together, so you may be next to strangers. The seats are comfy and the atmosphere is lively, and you will likely be socialising with your own company anyway

5) you/your clothes/coats will come out smelling of BBQ/oil/grease/chilli etc. The vents up above in the ceiling might not be doing anything useful at all

Would recommend going if you have lots of time, want to try different flavours on your palate and/want a different experience of cooking whilst socialising and eating.

Next time we come, we'll choose our clothes wisely.",['samgyeopsal'],1
89,hanguyen2,Miss Korea,4.0,Good food but a bit pricey,Don't understand the 10% tax or I think it's a tip added because they accept cash only :). The food is in small portion so need to order loads.,['samgyeopsal'],0
90,TylerDurdan,Miss Korea,4.0,Solid Korean and good fun,"Had a good night here with the family. Kimchi was spicy and delicious. On the BBQ the spicy pork was our favourite. Soups had lots of flavour. Prices were fine, not cheap but no big shock when bill arrived. Negatives; there is no extraction system so the place is full of bbq smoke, clothes will smell after; and like other reviewers noted the service charge is hidden. It is put on the bill as tax rather than service and the waitresses are vague when ask them if service is already included or not. It is.",['samgyeopsal'],0
91,PaulLondon1985,Miss Korea,4.0,"Very tasty, quick service","Had a lovely bowl of bibbimap, full of flavour. Excellent starters too. Quick efficient service. We did come out smelling of oil though!

92,UUKKYY,Miss Korea,2.0,Not really Korean food,"Food were small portions and the price were expensive. The waitress said they only receive cash after I have placed an order, so my friend had to go to the cash machine.

The toilet light was very dark.",['samgyeopsal'],0
93,Bhanudhir,Miss Korea,4.0,Even better than last time,"This was my first visit for quite a while and since it has been refurbished. Mid evening on a Friday night we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The new grills seemed easy to use and the waitress fired it up as soon as we ordered. We piled in with beef, prawns, omelette, seafood tempura and kimchi. It was great watching our prawns and beef griddle while we supped on beer and Korean tea (which has overtones of vanilla). We got lettuce with the beef (which made it great to make beef, barbecue sauce and kimchi parcels). The omelette/pancake was every bit as good as I had hoped after seeing Judy Joo make one on a TV programme. The prawn, fish and vegetable tempura were delicious, crispy with firm flesh and even better when dipped in soy sauce. The kimchi.was really fiery. There was far too much to eat but they kindly boxed the leftovers for us. The waitresses are friendly and efficient. It surprises me that so few brummies visit this place: most of the clientele were oriental. The food is delicious and £56 was not too bad considering how much we ordered. With parking just across the road I don't know why you haven't visited. Highly recommended.",['samgyeopsal'],1

97,nandasmm,Miss Korea,3.0,Offers reasonable prices but service was slow and the food was not exceptional...bear in mind they add 10% TAX to bill,"We visited this place one year ago and left unimpressed then. This time we arrived as a group of four for our meal and after ordering our food, service initially started very well. We got our drinks and the dishes started to arrive but after some time we were ignored. Our requests for drinks were ignored and after the first 3-4 dishes we ordered we had to wait 15-20 mins for the remainder of the dishes to arrive. It was then we noticed that the place wasn't that busy but they were serving dishes to the other tables that had arrived after us. The BBQ and seafood pancake was delicious and the bibimbap and teriyaki eel was passable. But the worst of all was the soft tofu stew. It was nothing like we had ever tried before. It was lacking in flavour and was more like a clear soup with bits of tofu, cucumber and one egg in it. At the end, when we asked for the bill we were also slapped with a 10% TAX at the end for poor service. We didn't complain but this is one place we will definitely not be coming back to.

Keep in mind, this place serves BBQ but has no ventilation system installed so it also becomes very stuffy and smoky. You will definitely leave the place smelling of BBQ and smoke.",['samgyeopsal'],0
98,N_pham90,Miss Korea,3.0,Overrated,"Heard about this place quite a while ago and I've heard good reviews so decided to take a visit with the family. Not much of a big place and the food was okay. Quite overrated. Service took a while. Mains came before the starters? And even when we've finished our mains the starters still hasn't come out. They forgot our orders and the staff seemed disorientated. Some of the bbq meat were good and the rest were taste less. Seafood platter was okay. Fresh. The potato, pumpkin veg platter came out after we had the meat and seafood platter so we sat there eating grilled veg. The spicy fried chicken was really good and the decor of the restaurant is pretty but apart from that it was mediocre.",['samgyeopsal'],1
99,stevewstour,Miss Korea,4.0,Typically good for the Chinese quarter,"I don't get why some of this cluster of restaurants can be so empty on a Saturday night while others are brimmed. Anyway, this place is in the latter category and it's easy to see why. I've never been to Korea so I can't vouch for the authenticity, but it's well worth a visit. The staff are very helpful and happy to walk you around the dishes. This is quite useful as some of the dishes a either quite spicy or served raw. They're also happy to anglosise a dish for you too, if what they're serving is a bit weird for you. Every table is equipped with a barbecue grill too, and this looks fun. I'm not sure where some of the ""expensive"" reviews come from on TA. 34 quid for 2 people with sides, drinks and starters is pretty good (what do you want for your money??) and the service was excellent, especially for a busy Saturday night. Cash only!",['samgyeopsal'],1

The food at Miss Korea is delicious very healthy for the first time I tried cold buckwheat noodles and it was very nice, the old saying is don't knock it until you tried.

She claimed herself as Manager which I don't believe she is and I openly said to her ""well you obviously failed your life and will stuck here forever! ""

All the tables were full so we were asked to wait at a table and given menus. The service was ok and the food was nice but there were a lot of people barbecuing and the atmosphere got thicker and thicker.

Lovely place,, could do a better in service.We were not even asked how our food was in the entire meal sessioin, but still charged extra as a service charge or don't know what, it only said tax.. but if you charge extra for the service, you have to up your game in sevice, I felt so.

The restaurant itself is not the poshest in the world, and if you're looking for intimacy then it's not really the place for you, but it is nicely decorated, the seats are comfortable and there's a friendly hubbub atmosphere. The waiting staff were friendly and accommodating, there was a wait for food but it was explained to us before we ordered so we didn't mind too much.
The food itself was tasty - we shared dumplings and edamame to start, then had black bean pork and noodles and bibimbap with a side of bean sprouts for main. It was tasty. With the exception of the bibimbap which came in it's own hot bowl, the food wasn't as hot as I would expect - but that's not to say it was unpleasant. (A lot of the menu is meat which you have to cook yourself on a built in grill on the table so I guess if you ordered that then your food would be super hot)
The reason the review is 4* and not 5* is that at the back of the restaurant there is some kind of function room or bar area, which generated a lot of loud noise throughout our dining experience, also, where we were sat was directly opposite the door and every time anyone went in or out the door stays open so we were repeatedly having to ask for the door to be closed as it was really cold. I understand the weather can't be helped and there are limited seats, we hadn't booked, so our table was probably one of the worst positions and if we had only had to ask once for the door to be closed I wouldn't mention it - it was the fact that even though the staff knew we were cold when the door was open and were stood and could clearly see (and feel) the door was open, they waited for us to ask before they closed it.
Overall though, a good experience.",['samgyeopsal'],1
112,Brum303,Miss Korea,3.0,Good food and a little bit different,"Celebrating a friends birthday so a small group. Keen to try something new we went for a set menu consisting of starters and main followed by ice cream. Starters was soup followed by something similar to dim sum. This was lovely and there was plenty of it. Then came main course which consists of various meats, vegetables and sauces which you cook for yourself using the hot plate in the centre of the table - think fondue style. Bit of a novelty factor which soon wore off as I eat out for someone to cook for me! Good to try/experience but if I went again I'd get something else. All of the food was lovely though.",['samgyeopsal'],1

114,reid1874,Miss Korea,1.0,avoid this place,"i gave this place a try as the other Korean restaurant 'Toppokki' across the road in china town seemed too busy. The food was absolute garbage from the frozen breaded prawn starters to a kimchi stew which tasted hideous, I felt like i could taste tomato ketchup in the soup. The service was pretty appalling, had to go out of my way to get the attention of the waitress who was frowning the entire evening. No authenticity, horrible tasteless bland food which is nothing like Korean home cooked food, poor service. If only I could give zero ratings.",['samgyeopsal'],0
115,CynicallyOptimistic,Miss Korea,1.0,What a let down for Korean dining,"In a nutshell:

Food and soups were all plain and bland.
Staff were not the friendliest.
Restaurant suits couples and large groups, I would encourage a family dining here.
Ventilation is a major issue in that place.
Price is not relative to the food quality nor dining experience.

Very disappointed and will probably stick to Topokki, that's just round the corner on Hurst St (check out my review on them too).

Wouldn't recommend at all.",['samgyeopsal'],0

117,Susannah G,Miss Korea,2.0,Good food but poor ventilation and extraction,"This has been a good place for tasty food and I have visited it on a number of occasions in the past. However, of late there is something wrong with their ventilation, which really affects the dining experience and what comes after it.

After a busy week I thought I'd take the evening off and eat out to save time and work, but ended up having to throw all of my clothes, including my coat and my backpack, into the wash. I left the restaurant smelling very strongly of food due to the lack of air circulation and extraction. Also, the floor tiles were so slippery that I nearly fell over, which says something as I was wearing sensible shoes with non-slip Vibram soles. Other customers were similarly shuffling and sliding along in their sneakers to avoid slipping.

Overall good food, but not a relaxing experience and it created far more work than if I had stayed at home and cooked for myself.",['samgyeopsal'],1
118,qetuos,Miss Korea,5.0,Still CASH ONLY,"Have been there for several times and really love the food. Be ready to wait for the food because it took ages for the food to come (except barbecue).

It has been a year since its reopening but they still accept cash only!!! This is very annoying because they used the same ""excuse"" every time which was that ""there is a problem with the card machine connection to the server at the moment ""!!! Come on! I've been to the restaurant around 10 times since their reopening last year and they explained the Cash Only thing with the same excuse every time!!

How could a card machine out of order for more than one year!? Because they never actually use the card machine!! Perhaps they're lying because of some particular reasons.

However, the food is good. Hope it would accept card payments as soon as possible.",['samgyeopsal'],1
119,Sun K,Miss Korea,1.0,Anniversary Meal Totally Ruined,"I took my family last Friday evening for my anniversary meal - something different I thought because we always go to Cafe Soya which I must say is excellent. All started off well, waitress was friendly & explained the different meals. We ordered & then we waited 35 minutes for drinks & then our meals came 1 after the other - my wife's first after 50 minutes them mine 10 minutes later & my children then waited a further 10 minutes for their meals. It's not as if we ordered anything out of the ordinary. It's was very annoying knowing my children were hungry & me & my wife had our meals eventually but they still hadn't had theirs. The waitress said there was a mix up with the order which I couldn't understand because everything was from their menu & numbered. How easy could it be - the place wasn't busy so there was no excuse at all & the apologising during our meal got very irritating - too cap it off the waitress apologised again & then said they wouldn't charge the 10 % service charge. We couldn't wait too get out of there & would never return - the food is okay, the portions are mediocre & the prices are expensive for what it is but I will emphasise I will keep to what I know & stick ' Cafe Soya' in the future",['samgyeopsal'],0

124,Mr_Jutla,Miss Korea,5.0,Smokier than Chinese,"First time I've had a Korean meal, came across this place on TripAdvisor and read the reviews as protocol. The place was only 30metres from where I was so took a look with my own eyes. When it comes to eating out, the number one thing that friends ask me is, ""where can I get good Indian food?"" (I'm of Indian origin) and my answer is always the same, ""wherever you see Indian people eating"". I followed my own advice and opted to dine at Miss Korea as this is where Koreans were eating. They have the raw menu where you can cook your own meat on the built in grill on your table, like a self serve teppan yaki but my friends and I opted for the cooked choices. We enjoyed a smokey chicken teriyaki sizzling on the iron plate, the sweet and spicy chicken, veg noodles and the some of the crispiest tempura in a light and fresh batter. Sides of cucumber relish and kimchi. To not cloud the flavour we stuck with water as it was our first experience of Korean cuisine. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal and at the end we took guesses as to the bill, it came in under a third under our estimates! Full of flavour and excellent value, goes to show you have to try things and make your own opinions.",['samgyeopsal'],1

127,KRPT,Miss Korea,4.0,Very nice meal but do go prepared.,"We had high hopes and expectation for the place and it did not disappoint us at all. The flavours were good and we loved the BBQ dishes we have been craving for. We ordered a portion of the raw beef (Yuk Hwae) and wow! Thanks to other reviewers, we were dressed prepared for the smoky BBQ environment and had we not been warned, we would have been pretty annoyed if we had turned up in our Sunday best only to find we needed to literally strip as we walked into our home and everything went into the wash and bodies in the shower! However, if you are prepared, it really is worth it. The only criticism is the ""excuse"" of the card machine being ""still"" out of order, we wondered if it had ever worked. We thought it would have given a better impression to simply state cash only up front as it would not deter us from eating there again at all. The food itself is enough to draw in customers.",['samgyeopsal'],1

132,Zoe_Gabrielle,Miss Korea,1.0,A very disappointing 1st visit after some recommendations!,"Today, I was craving for Korean food for lunch. And so, after my friend's recommendation and all the positive reviews, I've decided to hive Miss Korea a try. It was the only reason why I went to the city centre today and I was excited.

Upon entering the restaurant, I've noticed the nice yet simple decor. I find it very cosy. I was greeted with a ""hello"" by the waitress, I sat and checked on the menu that looks sumptuous. I was very hungry I couldn't wait to order and feast.

It took quite a few minutes before my order was taken even though it was quiet today. I've ordered for kimchi, jap chae and beef Bulgogi bibimbap. Come the drinks, I asked for korean tea. However I was told that their bar is closed. Ok, I opt for Sprite with loads of ice. But then, I was told they have no ice! At this point,miss a starting to feel a bit annoyed. Alright then, I can do without ice.

I stood up to go to the toilet and the waitress had another news for me. There is no light in the toilet and even said that if I want, I can use my mobile phone as a light! How unacceptable! By this time, I've already lost my appetite. Closed bar, no ice then no
light in the toilet. To top it all, I was told they only accept cash payment as their card machine is broken! What an appalling service I got today. That broken card machine has been their issue for quite some time now! Does it really take long to fix it? I've told the waitress that it has been terrible experience I've had with them today.

And since my appetite has already been spoilt, I left the restaurant without tasting their food. I'm not even sure if I would come back to try it. I was very disappointed. And quite frankly, I don't care if a restaurant's food is good, if the service is bad then I shall never go back nor will I recommend it to any of my friends.

I ended up in Toppoki which is just on the other side and I've enjoyed their food very much.",['samgyeopsal'],0

141,680amitm,Miss Korea,5.0,Fascinating,"Having eaten Korean before, on a visit to Hong Kong. I knew roughly what to expect.

142,smjohns,Miss Korea,1.0,Wish I had tried the food!!,"Had heard great things about this place and the menu had us drooling. When we arrived the staff were welcoming and there was a nice buzz to the place. We ordered a drink whilst we waited for our pals but by the time they had joined us and finished their drink too, we had to leave. Unfortunately we were overwhelmed by the odour.

The problem is that this place is Korean BBQ, so you cook your own food at the table. Sounds like a great idea but not when there is little or no ventilation. We were there for less than 30mins but our clothes stank of fried food / oil for the rest of the night.

Considering this is a fairly new venue, it is not going to smell any better with time, especially with the wood paneling and cloth covered chairs. A commercial kitchen is not allowed to open without proper ventilation so I have no idea how this place remains open without the same in the dining room.

Such a shame !!",['samgyeopsal'],0
143,BarrySiddick,Miss Korea,5.0,So delicious!!!,I love Korean food so much and Korean BBQ in particular. We went here a little tipsy and left more that satisfied.

145,266timothyp,Miss Korea,4.0,Authentic Korean Dining in Nottingham,"This new restaurant provides to my mind authentic Korean flavours and dining experiences. I am no expert but have a little knowledge of Korean food having visited the country about 20 times. I was told that the chef is Korean and this was borne out in the flavours I enjoyed in my lunchtime Bulgogi Bibimpap a few days ago.

The melon juice was typical of the kinds of accompaniment one enjoys with Korean food, and the kimchee (pickled spicy cabbage) really did take me back to a country I have enjoyed visiting over many years.

The restaurant was very quiet when we viisted but this was just before the start of the university terms in Nottingham. Nottingham's 60,000 new and returning students (or at any rate some of them) no doubt will give the place a bit of atmosphere shortly.

There was only one (non-Korean) waitress serving when we visited, but this no doubt reflects the fact that we were there at lunchtime, at a quiet time of the week. I would say however that the confident manner in which Korean waiters and waitresses serve and talk about the food it is their job to bring to you is another very nice aspect of restaurants in Korea. If this place can manage it it should hire some Korean waiting staff it would provide even more genuineness in the dining experience.

The only thing I really quibble however with is the name of the restaurant. Viewed either as referring to a yearning for visiting Korea or to a beauty pageant, it is slightly cheesy. Something that speaks to you of Korea's ancient culture in my view would be more appropriate. This is a small reservation about a generally good restaurant that I intend to visit again.",['samgyeopsal'],1

147,ashley l,Miss Korea,2.0,Only bibimbap,"The service is one of the worse. I even questioned myself what had I done to make the waitress treat my table with so much hatred, but I guess she did that to every customer. She didnot say a word or understand anything we asked. She gave us cold stares. The food is no where compare to Toppoki, the other korean restaurant. I think because the chefs are not koreans. My friends live near the restaurant, its the only reason we came there so often. The size was small, pricey and not authentic. The best dish is bibimbap, that is the only compliment I can give",['samgyeopsal'],0
148,Bhanudhir,Miss Korea,4.0,Yum yum yum,"My second visit to a hidden treasure Nice modern decor without being ostentatious.

Vegetable dumplings, vegetable fritters and squid in spicy sauce followed by pork, squid and prawns cooked on the barbecue. Fantastic quality food at a very reasonable price. Definitely one to check out and try again. Bring lots of friends",['samgyeopsal'],1
149,Joseph L,Miss Korea,1.0,Aimed at students and not family friendly.,"As other reviews have said, the waiting service is poor. This is mainly down to the poor attitude of the waitress with glasses. There were several scenarios where arguments nearly broke out. The food is average and I've had better in London. They do not have space for you to put buggies and it ends up near the door. I did't feel comfortable with this.",['samgyeopsal'],0
150,AdamTien,Miss Korea,2.0,Not worth it!,"I came down to Birmingham for the day (from London) for business reasons and was craving some Korean food after a hard days work, but had no idea on where I could get some. So then I contacted a few friends who resided in the city and asked for recommendations, which then later they brought me to ""Miss Korea"".

When we first stepped into the restaurant we weren't greeted, my first impression of the interior was that it was immaculate and bold. However, it was quite smokey inside as there was an open kitchen but also meat being grilled on some customers table tops, but that was understandable. After being noticed a few minutes later we were then seated and decided to order:
3 portions of bulgogi
1 portion of la Galbi
1 portion of lettuce
2 portions of kimchi cabbage
1 portion of seasoned spinach
1 portion of dukbokki
1 portion of rice
1 portion o fkimchi fried rice
and 4 drinks

The food was of good quality but had it's flaws, such as the dukbokki was quite over cooked which resulted in a really mushy texture, the kimchi fried rice was quite on the dry side and also the portions were quite small compared to the price. But that wasn't the problem, the real problem was the staff and service. Firstly, the female staff who was serving us was sulking for some reason and seemed like she didn't want to serve us. Her attitude towards us, was like she didn't care about anything and just wanted to go home. After our order was taken, we had to wait rather long for our food to arrive and then when it finally arrived some dishes were missing. For example the meats arrived but the lettuce and rice were nowhere to be found and it seemed that the waitress had forgotten about them. Which then I reminded her and she said, I quote ""okay"" and left. No apology whatsoever. When we nearly finished the meat, she then brings out the rice and lettuce and still no apology. With then we decided to just finish quickly and leave as we didn't felt welcomed.

The food was of good standard but the price was a bit of the high side. The staff and service however was the final killing blow that assured me to never come back to this restaurant and try else where.",['samgyeopsal'],0

153,Nakte S,Miss Korea,3.0,Mostly bland,"This was my first experience with Korean food, and I was excited to go since my friends hyped up Miss Korea to me the night before. I have heard of bulgogi and kimchi, and always wanted to try them, so I was looking forward to the trip.

Upon arrival, we were seated at a table for four people (with five of us). The grill also appeared to be broken. It took ten minutes of nervous whispering and attempting to flag down the waiting staff for us to be moved to a bigger table with a working grill.

The ordering felt rushed and we had to send away the waitress as we didn't feel ready, and when she came back we had to rush a decision out of a feeling of awkwardness. I was then told by a friend who had been here before that their kimchi is not authentic at all, and would be a disappointment, so I decided to forego it. The food itself took a really long time to arrive, with the first main arriving close to fifteen minutes before the last. I found the starter (sadly I forgot the name, it looks like a deep fried pancake folded in half over some filling) and my main (bulgogi chicken with veg and rice in a hot stone bowl) generally bland and even a tad sickening in taste. The only redeeming quality of the main was the meat, which was delicious, but scarce. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the beef bulgogi and beer marinated beef that we could grill ourselves. They were absolutely delicious, but too felt like very little meat for £6+ per plate.

As another review points out, the service is terrible. The waiting staff pay no attention to what goes around them (we had to raise our voice to borderline shouting in order to get their attention from a meter away), the two waitresses seem very timid and even scared. Another lady, who appears to be their manager, has a very hostile air about her, made no effort to seem welcoming when talking to us and berated the two girls in the plain view of customers. When they do appear, the waitresses would come to the table, take the utensils and stir the meat on the grill after seeing you do it, before walking off without a word? Empty plates were not taken away from the table through the meal and once again the staff had to be almost shouted to in order to tell them that we would like our bill.

Overall, I wasn't very impressed with the restaurant apart from the novelty of the grill, which I did enjoy. As far as I understand the food isn't very authentic, and isn't a great representation of quality of Korean food. The service is poor and I felt like I overpaid for the little food that I did eat. I told my friends I stopped eating because I had enough and wasn't hungry any more, whichever as true enough, but the cause of that was a lack of appetite, and not a full stomach. The only reason I can see myself coming back to Miss Korea is for the grill meats, and exclusively that.",['samgyeopsal'],0

160,tanewman,Miss Korea,3.0,Something different for Brum,"Location - Central, directly opp Arcadian car park

Atmosphere - V friendly staff, really welcoming it's quite modern but as though it's been done on the cheap so I wouldn't recommend as a romantic venue.

Food - I had never tried Korean food and enjoyed the different flavours. We didn't go for anything in the BBQ menu (where the meat is cooked at your table) but wish we had given it a try.

All in all, nice flavours, fresh food, a tad greasy - give it a try!",['samgyeopsal'],1

162,Francoph,Miss Korea,4.0,Relaxed and enjoyable,"Having read some of the reviews, we were quite anxious about eating at Miss Korea, but we needn't have been. The service was thoughtful and help was offered but not pushed. The friends we went with had been several times before. I really enjoyed the dish I had with eel, as did one of our friends. My partner had a beef dish and the other friend had tofu. The kimchi and other side dish were very spicy but delicious and gave us something to nibble before our main dishes arrived. Drinks were good too - I had a soya drink, one friend had beer and the two men shared a spirit which, whilst good at the time had rather an unfortunate hangover as an after effect. Probably best avoided! We were not hustled or harassed and were able to enjoy a very happy evening chatting and enjoying good food. We'll definitely return and hope to try some of the other dishes next time. Thank you miss Korea.",['samgyeopsal'],1

164,simond1974,Miss Korea,2.0,could be better,"me and my wife visit Birmingham to shop at the Korean restaurant in Selly Oak then like to have a meal out somewhere. we found this place through tripadvisor. First time we went all seemed ok a little expensive for what is kimbab cheonguk meals but barring that food was ok. Went again today and food was of average quality and prices for the dishes seemed more expensive. we ordered food and drinks including a seafood pancake which was way too small also the portions of bibbimbap were too small even my son (10 years old) complained of being still hungry after the meal. Biggest shock was getting the bill 3 pounds for water and 2 pounds for a glass of warm sprite that had been served out of a 2 litre bottle from the supermarket.
Seriously!!! having lived and worked in Korea for 6 years I know that you will never attain the same service standards as there, but saying that, charging for water in a Korean restaurant......
As a lover of Korean food I wont be going again. Sorry!!!",['samgyeopsal'],0
165,AJMids,Miss Korea,2.0,I'd give it a 'Miss',"I thought we'd give this place a try having been to two other Korean bbq restaurants in the area of town, looks okay from the outside and it wasn't busy plus the menu looked nice in the window.
We were quickly seated and set about choosing our food - there is a good bbq selection but I fancied something different so we chose a couple of starters, a side, two mains and an extra. This didn't take too long but then the waiting began.
There were two other couples and a table of around ten guys who were doing their own bbq and didn't need much assistance. The kitchen seemed well staffed, two girls serving but one was also doing the bar and the manageress was easily spotted in the kitchen too.
More waiting.........
I haven't even been asked what I want to drink yet.
More waiting.........
Im getting impatient and annoyed now but I am still being ignored by the serving staff.
Okay now I'm angry and I decided in one minute I am going to get up and walk out.
45 seconds in I get served!. We order everything and it doesn't take too long to come - it all comes at different times and overall the food was very nice, couldn't fault it.
but then the waiting starts again........
Ive finished my drink and want another, I even position the empty glass to the side of the table near the servers but it doesn't happen.
I wouldn't mind some dessert too but im still sat around waiting and getting impatient again and eventually I announce '*$%% it' and get up, pay and leave.
Luckily you pay at the counter and don't ask the waitress for a bill otherwise I would of been there much longer.

They missed out on me having another couple of beers and trying the Korean rice wine plus a couple of desserts. I wont go back again - I did think about venting my anger at the manageress but she just looks at you from the kitchen and doesn't give any direction to waiting staff.
If it was busy then god help anyone wanting to get served.
I had to go somewhere else for pudding and a few beers and I wont go there again. There are much better Korean restaurants in the quarter so I would give Miss Korea a big miss.",['samgyeopsal'],1
166,stendec63,Miss Korea,4.0,Good value Korean Food with a on table BBQ option if you want,"After sharing a room with several Korean ladies, my daughter has a love for Korean culture, especially the food!

We try and find a good Korean food when ever we travel together, and closer to home as often as we can. A weeks holiday and a rainy day was a good excuse to try out Miss Korea, a BBQ style place close to the cinema.

The decor is minimalistic, with stainless steel and chrome predominated. The food and staff were Korean (so my daughter said). Despite being a busy Sunday lunchtime we were seated quickly. The menus are in Korean and English, and coded (in case you don't want to try and pronounce the names) with colour pictures to give you an idea of what to expect.

A complementary small portion of spicy korean salad to start with was a good start.

We ordered KIMCHI CHIGAE and BULGOGI DOLSOT BIBIMBAB and both of those were excellent. My soup came bubbling hot, and was full of flavour and spicy. Rice was included. I would also recommend the jugs of fruit juice. The mango we had was great!

It was good food at a good price (under £30 for a meal with drinks and a starter). A chain worth supporting...",['samgyeopsal'],1

Nice friendly restaurant with BBQ facility in the center of each table allowing you to cook your own meal if you so desire. Its not a 5* restaurant so don't walk in there with high expectations of glitz and glamour, or outstanding Ritz table service. The prices are reasonable and the service is absolutely fine.

169,Noob1,Miss Korea,1.0,Terrible overall.,"I went last year when they first opened and had a very bad experience. The wait for being served was long and the food came separately which caused us to eat at separate times.
We went this time thinking the service would have improved by now but it hasn't. We were shown to the table after 5 minutes by the waitress whereas the owner chose to stand behind the bar watching. The first dish came half an hour later and still no sign of drinks. It was busy so it was understandable that the food would take awhile but we ordered around half 7 and only just had the main dishes served around half 8/9. The bbq was turned off so we asked the owner to check for us and then he told us the bbq on this table was broke and and he asked us to moved, I questioned him why it took them so long to let us know that and he blamed it on the waitress, he asked the waitresses and she confirmed that it wasn't brokenand then he pushed her away and got the kitchen to cook our meat inside. Overall it wasn't a very nice experience mainly because of the wait, service and also the food doesn't taste as good as Toppoki.",['samgyeopsal'],0
170,Maggie F,Miss Korea,4.0,Something a bit different.,"We decided to try this place for lunch on a quick trip to Birmingham. There were four of us. Our waitress was very helpful, explaining and recommending dishes. We had a selection of appetisers, some meat that we bbq'd in the pit on the table, a broth dish and teriyaki salmon. I have no idea how authentic it is but it was all delicious. The gyoza were better than wagamama. The other dishes were interesting and made a change from Chinese/Japanese/Thai. There was plenty of food but not too much. It came to £61 which I thought was good value, we only had soft drinks. Only point to improve was that the ladies loo could have been a bit cleaner.",['samgyeopsal'],1
171,luckyme200,Miss Korea,4.0,Enjoyable.,"Miss Korea is a small, but smart looking little restaurant. There is a detailed menu and lots to choose from. It sounds like some people have had a bad experience, but really in my eyes it was very positive. The menu offers great choice but doesn't give you too much support if you're not familiar with Korean cuisine, that said it compared favourably to my previous experience with Korean restaurants. The food was quick, well presented, seasoned and flavoured and good value. The drinks a little more expensive but not out of sync with other restaurants. We didn't have any experience with the tap water, but in fairness to them at least they're up front about it. The service was attentive, no waiting at all to be helped, there was no checking-in on your enjoyment during the meal which is a little unusual but really not an issue for me. I would go again and would be happy to recommend it to others too.",['samgyeopsal'],1

Staff were very helpful and we had three starters and two mains including a deep fried tofu starter and a spicy pork stew with kimche the pickled cabbage that seems to be very important to their cuisine. We also had a glass of white wine and an iced lemon tea. The food was delicious Anf plentiful and the bill was £29!

174,simon s,Miss Korea,1.0,Avoid this restaurant; Bill was calculated wrongly on purpose,"I used to like this restaurant until today. I've been to ""Miss Korea"" more than 5 times in the past 1 years, I like the food although it's a bit over-priced. Today me and my wife ordered 4 dishes, a ice cream and a coke, everything is ok until I have the bill, there're 2 more drinks on the bill(Strawberry milk shake& J2O papaya, totally 6 pounds) which we never ordered, in the meanwhile there's only one big empty cup on our table.

I asked waitress, she realized immediately before I told her what happened. She then went to modify bill and bring the correct bill back without a apology. She seems not very happy about we checked bill carefully and found out what they did to our bill. I asked some of my Chinese friend, they have the same experience of be given wrongly-calculated bill. I think they're doing this on purpose, because what they add into bills are drinks, which are their most profitable things in menu.

As people already mentioned before: they don't serve tap water. why? as far as I can tell, a big part of their profit are from drinks. if you have a tap water which is free, they earn nothing from their over-priced drink. eg: a Korean grape drink, in ""Miss Korea"" 2.5 quid, in 100 feet-away Chinese convenience store: 50p. Now maybe you can see the reason why they don't serve any tap water.

Avoid this restaurant. if you can't, be prepared that there won't be any tap water served. Carefully check your bill.

Pro: the food was ok.

Con: Serve no tap water, Add drinks which you never ordered to bill stealthily",['samgyeopsal'],0
175,Doug_1970,Miss Korea,3.0,"A good restaurant, but not authentic Korean","I travel to Korea often on business so am fairly familiar with authentic Korean food. I was looking forward to eating here and seeing how the food in Birmingham compared with Seoul.

Firstly, none of the staff are Korean. Not that this in itself is a bad thing, but it would be nice to have some Korean staff in a Korean restaurant instead of all Chinese. All of the staff were friendly and efficient though, so we had no complaints with the service.

I found the food to be a disappointment though. While they had many of the normal Korean favorites, our food tasted very bland compared to authentic Korean. We ordered bulgogi, which didn't come with any of the normal side dishes, we even had to ask for lettuce.

If you had never been to a Korean restaurant before, then this place would be fine. But if you've already been exposed to proper Korean food, then you're probably going to end up disappointed.",['samgyeopsal'],1
176,jhwang0204,Miss Korea,1.0,Not authentic....at all,"From a Korean's perspective, I didn't find food at Miss Korea at all authentic or tasty. I could have made a better Bibimbap myself; Yuk-Kae-Jang tasted like mild beef stock; Kimchi-Jeon too sweet; Sam-Gyup-Sal tasted like cardboard.

I was surprised how Kimchi-Jeon and Hae-Mul-Pajeon were on desserts menu.... Just because the English translation is ""Kimchi pancakes"" and ""Seafood pancakes"" doesn't mean they are dessert material - far from it! The waiter who served me wasn't familiar with the menu, which made me having to point out the dishes one by one with my finger.

I was also appalled by how they refuse to serve tap water. Yes, bad for their profit - but shouldn't they still serve it if the customer wants it?",['samgyeopsal'],0

179,Tiberious_ok,Miss Korea,4.0,Pleasant experience and really good food,"With only one review for this restaurant (and a bad one at that), I didn't have high hopes. But, my wife really wanted to have some Korean food before a concert (Symphony Hall, a 10min drive away). So, this is the only Korean restaurant we could find in Birmingham.

It has a car park directly opposite. The restaurant is on the edge of China Town, and looks ok from the outside. On entry, its clean and tidy, nothing glamourous but pleasant. The menu is very Korean I think, although I think some of the staff were Chinese (not surprising in China Town). The menu had a heavy BBQ component, with the option to have BBQ bucket on your table to cook the food, or pre cooked by the chef. We opted for the later, as had limited time.

There were also the famous spicy cabbage dishes and soups. A good idea was to have option of jugs for juice/drinks, at reduced cost, which is good especially if your driving...plenty of juices to chose from too.

The food was fresh, plentiful, good value and really tasty. Lamb skewers went down a treat, as did the beef in beer and sliced pork dishes.

The only thing I could fault was no hand drier in the small gents toilet. Waitress was friendly, polite and attentive.

Would go again, its a really good addition to the cuisine availble in Birmingham China Town.",['samgyeopsal'],1
180,wolvesBirmingham,Miss Korea,1.0,What a terrible day out,"I wanted some water for my 2 year old son and was refused. After our meal I challenged the owner about refusing tap water and he said it was not healthy. Probably he meant not healthy for his profit margins. Disgusting attitude.

I am a huge fan of Korean food and have tasted many wonderful dishes in Korea itself. This is without doubt the worst I have ever had. The bulgogi tasted like a Chinese stir fry and the bibimbap was just run of the mill and quite tasteless.

To add to our misery, the owner had a tense and heated meeting with his staff a few tables away from us which made us feel uncomfortable. It just shows how unconsiderate he is. These meetings should take place behind closed doors and away from the public. I felt ever so sorry for the Korean cooks, they looked so sad and downbeaten by the owner’s bully approach.

Birmingham really needs a Korean restaurant. This is not it and you will be wise to avoid it. A huge disappointment.",['samgyeopsal'],0

195,Ash6996,Taste of Korea - Amazing Chicken,5.0,First ever Korean dinner,"After the wife suggested Korean for the first time ever and we googled it, this place came up with mixed but mainly good reviews even right here on Trip advisor. We though we'd give it a go. After driving around Gulf hotel apartments twice I had to get out of the car to walk around a little but eventually found it. Location could be better however that's all made up for when you try the food.

Small premises but comfortable, ambiance a little lacking as well and the food quality actually deserves a better more fitting authentic Korean mood in a nicer more accessible premises.

Anyway to the food, we ordered the Marinated Korean BBQ beef, the mixed spicy/sweet chicken, the Kimche rice and vegetable rice. The order came with an amazingly zestful tasty cold soup and a lot of sides and sauce . From the moment this stuff hit my tastebuds I was in heaven and I have now added Korea to one of those places one must visit before they die if only just for the food. Fragrant, aromatic, mouth watering, and satisfying. We will definitely be back don't care what the naysayers have to say.

My friends and I ( a group of 5 people) had dinner here on the 21st of January, 2016. It's in an alley across from chocolate room. There is a little area to park your car in front of the restaurant. It's open 7 days a week. It's closed from 3 pm to 4.30pm. The prices are reasonable and the food is to die for. I had dukbokki, kimchi Jeon, japchae, my husband had bulgogi and my friend had bibimbab. They were all delicious. It is a small restaurant but if you miss Korean food in Oman you can definitely have it here.","['bibimbap', 'bulgogi', 'pajeon']",1

211,Rolando Jr L,Taste of Korea - Amazing Chicken,4.0,Excellent Korean food near Muscat Grand Mall,"We're fond of Japanese and Korean dishes, and ever since the first Korean restaurant that we discovered near Ghala closed, we missed eating authentic Korean food in Muscat. That's why when friends told us that there's another Korean restaurant in the capital, we searched for it and tried their signature dishes. We were not disappointed.
The chicken was fantastic (there are 2 variants, one glazed with honey-barbecue sauce, the other just plain fried). It is basically similar to the dish from our favorite restaurant when we visited Seoul. Their japchae was also superb, and the kimbap as well. Their bulgogi was not exactly what I expected, but it was also generally good.They even serve few Japanese dishes, such as the miso soup which we ordered, which, I would say, was also tasty. The only thing I was disappointed a bit was that the side dishes (ban chan) was fewer compared to the previous Korean restaurant that we used to visit.
This restaurant is a little bit small; there are only about 5 tables, if I remember correctly. There is ample parking space at the side of the building where the restaurant is located. In terms of location, the restaurant is not hard to find, as it is just on the opposite road of Chocolate Room, another popular establishment in Ghubra.
The price is a little bit on the expensive side, but that's how it is anyway in majority of restaurants in Muscat.","['bibimbap', 'bulgogi', 'pajeon']",1

The food is always good and they do have a limited selection of beer and wine. The food is Korean with some Japanese influences. The kimchi was not killer spicy, the dumplings were tasty, and the bulgogi (beef) was moist and tender. In the past I've had the very tasty but spicy kimchi soup. (Spicy items are clearly marked on the menu.) The decor in this small restaurant is the very home-like, with lots of Korean knickknacks on display. The service is polite and efficient, and the prices are reasonable for Boulder.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
219,RedFrost,Korea House,5.0,Amazing food with very kind and friendly owner!,"This place is a gem in Boulder, that few know about. This place has amazing food. I love their Mandoo soup. I always get that or their spicy beef soup. The kimchi is fantastic and the rice cooked to perfection. It is a family owned place (one of the few remaining in Boulder) where the husband serves the food and his wife cooks. He is the most pleasant person you will ever meet. He pulls out your chair for you when seating and always is attentive, and comes quickly if you need something. The restaurant is very cute and I admire the way he decorates. It is a random assortment of stuff from all over the world. The restaurant is always clean as if he just opened. The food smells delicious from the back. I have become a regular because of his food and the family’s kindness. I was having a rough day once and he brought a mochi dessert, on the house. If you are looking for quality Korean food at a reasonable price, this is the place to come. He is always so grateful to all who come to eat at his restaurant. This place, is by far my favorite place to eat in Boulder and I was born and raised here. He will go to any length to make sure you enjoy your meal. You can also do take out, but I highly recommend you stay and enjoy his hospitality. He has Korean and other Asian beers as well as sake of different types. This restaurant is sadly, tucked away behind a gas station so it is not visible from 28th street. But once you know where it is. It is very convenient with tons of parking available. Great place to eat alone, with family or friends. I always walk out with a smile on my face and a warmth in my belly due to his wife’s amazing cooking. To the customer who said that he charged them 20% tip without them knowing, then he did not read his receipt or the menu. So please disregard that review as, the owner is the farthest thing from a con man. As noted with the dessert he so generously gave to me. I have a feeling the customer leaving the one star review, had a party of six or more and it is common practice at restaurants, to place a 20% gratuity charge on this many at one table. So next time you want a really good place to eat with great service stop in here. It is well worth it. I guarantee you won’t be disappointed.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

222,MunichEricJ,Korea House,4.0,Good Korean food in Boulder,"We visited on a Monday evening just to check it out. I tried the Bulgogi and it was good and tasted just like the Bulgogi I get in Korea. The Kimchi was also authentic, and they offer Kloud beer on tap so I had that. The service was excellent, provided by a kind and friendly Korean fellow. Prices were very reasonable.
There is a wide variety, a mix of Korean, Japanese and a bit of “pan Asian” on the menu – I suppose that Boulder is too small to support a Korean- only menu. As for beer, not so many Americans have heard of Kloud, Hite or Cass, so no wonder that more familiar brands like Asahi and Sapporo are also offered.
There’s a pleasant atmosphere with seating for around 30, so it’s not very large.
I would love to see a real down and dirty grill- at- the- table pork or beef Korean BBQ place in Boulder – I’ll bet it would be a big hit. But for the meantime, Korea House is worth going to, and returning to.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
223,Luke M,Korea House,1.0,Barely edible,"I lived in Seoul for almost a decade and this place's food tastes nothing like real Korean food. Overpriced (though I wouldn't eat their food again at any price, even free) and the ""recipes"" have been changed to ""suit American tastes"". Ha.

If you are in Colorado and want food that is more indicative of the cuisine you can find in Korea, I recommend Daegee (either CO location) or Soban in Aurora. Neither is spot on, but they are the closest I've found.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
224,jeanporr,Korea House,4.0,"Delicious, quick lunch, with excellent service","Contrary to previous reviews, the owner/server is friendly and efficient. He doesn't try to be your best friend, but that's not his job. He does see to it that your food arrives promptly, and that you have everything you need. I didn't need to wave him over for anything; all was foreseen. He checked several times during the meal, just in case.

I had the bento box with beef and dumplings, which proved quite tasty. It also included a cabbage side and rice. Unlike some Asian restaurants here, this one offers brown rice, a healthful plus.

The decor is a combination American country/Asian kitsch. The location is an easily-accessible strip mall with ample parking.

I will definitely return often, and I would encourage others to give it a try.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

The salad was a bit of iceberg lettuce with no dressing. The white rice was harmless. When the manager (owner?) asked how our food was, we told him.

So my thought was, ah new management, new cook. Alas, new does no mean better. This restaurant changes hands frequently, but seems never to rise above mediocre.

This restaurant is the closest thing to being in Korea that I have experienced in Colorado. I lived in Suwon, South Korea for more than a year, and this place captures the ambiance exactly. It's like eating in a Korean living room, with fun little decorations everywhere.

The food is fresh, tasty, and authentically Korean. We didn't order sushi, but kept to the Kimchi Jjigae (김치 찌개) and Kimchi Jeon (pancake). It was relaxing, and we had a great conversation with the owner over our food. After he learned that we had lived in Korea, he gave us a Kloud beer on the house!

Seemed like very authentic food, dinnerware, decor, even music.
This is a small, family run restaurant. You feel like a guest in their home. Everything nice quality and gracious. Not inexpensive, but seemed worth it to us. Portions seemed just right--more would have been too much, and we never take home a doggie bag.

Do not miss the Pearl barley Tea. It is different, but it is great. The people here work very hard to satisfy you. Some of the items on the menu are an adventure for some Americans so ask if Americans are going to like them. If you are looking for Adventure the food is very good. The Soups are particularly good . Spicy and full of vegetables and sea food. You can them to adjust the level of spice if the stock is not pre prepared.

243,Lee Y,Korea House,1.0,arrogant and racist waiter,"The waiter of this restaurant was extremely ARROGANT and went totally psycho when two of us asked whether we could sit at a table of 4 when there is only one table taken by two guests in the entire restaurant with about 10 tables total. He owner said IT WAS THEIR LUNCH TIME and they did not want 2 guests to sit at a table of 4. I asked then why the other two guests were sitting at a table of four. he said because they were Americans. At that moment my friend and I just wanted to get food and leave but his rudeness was not done yet. When we ordered and asked about lunch special, the owner said NO, IT IS NOT LUNCH TIME! Then I asked:""When is your lunch time then?"" He got pissed and asked us to leave. OMG! This is horrible.

I promised we were not being arrogant or anything. At the beginning I was thinking his rudeness might be a result of his limited English, as an immigration I should have more patience and sympathy. But no, i was wrong. He was rude and the reason he refused us what he served with the two white Americans was because we are not white.

Although I did not have the chance to dine here, I got a chance to glance at their menu. It was pricy compared to many other Korean restaurants in this area. And they don't have many typical Korean dishes on their menu. So it might be a good thing we were driven out of this place.

It was my first time ever to write a review about anything online. I just feel there are so many hard working restaurant owners and waiter/waitresses to be supported and this kind of people should run out of business if they are not changing their attitude.

Avoid this restaurant.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",0
244,Melanie S,Korea House,1.0,Rudest Owner Ever.,"I have never felt such an overwhelming urge to write a negative review for an establishment.

I walked in after a long day of work looking to order some takeout and enjoy it at home. After perusing the menu I decided to order an appetizer (vegetable dumplings) and a roll of sushi. I'm a tiny gal (4'11 and 96 lbs.) so this is more than enough to feed just myself. I had, however, been looking forward to trying the food here and had every intention of coming back and eating in another day when I had more of an appetite and could order a larger meal. Today I wanted to keep it simple. The owner, however, refused to even serve me unless I ordered an entree, which I simply wasn't interested in today. Not only that, but if I asked any questions about the items or dishes, not only did I not get much of a response, he just seemed irritated and responded in a very condescending manner.

I left absolutely disgusted with the way I was treated, and you can rest assured I will NEVER step foot in this restaurant again. I'm positive there are plenty of other restaurants in the area that would be happy to have my business and who are actually interested in having returning customers.

Good luck establishing any kind of clientele with this attitude.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",0

The spicy pork wasn't at all like any bulgogi we have had anywhere. The flavor wasn't there and the sauce was pasty tasting. The meal came with two small dishes of kimchi and pickle none of the other accompanyments that I normally see.

It looked like the decor had changed so perhaps it is under new management but they had better review their changes or I'm pretty sure the will go out of business. My favorite dish is Bulgogi ( a korean BBQ beef). This restaurant used to have wonderful slices of this marinated beef. The dinner I got today arrived in a ""bento box"" which is a novel way to serve Asian food, however, the meat that came in the box was like leftover scraps. It was about four tablespoons of beef shreds, the biggest was about the size of a dime. The was about half a cup of rice, a teaspoonful of green vegetable and about a tablespoon of Kimchi. I had ordered a combo with dumplings ( gyoza) and there were four of those without the unique dipping sauce that usually accompanies it. $2.00 worth of food costed $10.50. I left there very diappointed and hungry! Sad to say, I will not be back!","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",0

I travel a lot and always seek out asian restaurants. Korea House isn't 5 star but it is very good. The Kimchi is great. Pickled veggies are good.

The Kalbi (my favorite) is very good. The galbi was disappointing

252,Lpulitude,코리아하우스,1.0,Royal cuisine not Royal at all,"We've had high expectations as we booked the Korea royal cuisine online costing us quite something even the package we chosen was the cheapest one.

The experience was contrary to what we expected. First, we were not sitted in a Palace like dining area. In fact it was like a shack with no window to any outside view and only big enough for 4 square tables inside. Next there's no air circulation comfort in the room, and it's next to the kitchen. So no ambience, no comfort and no view!

The food spread was good but was averagely prepared. There are couple of nice dishes such as the nicely cooked abalone but a lot other were very basics & ordinary. The cutlery used were also very ordinary making us feel the value for money is not worth it. Not to mention the beef was so tough that Myeongdong street bbq beef is so much better!

Conclusion, we feel the charges is simply not worthy the food & ambience provided, and we suspected this is far from the real Royal cuisine. Skip this!","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

The reception where guests were received was bare, and I mean really bare. There was only a standing podium and a staff to receive the guests and check the name for the reservation. We were led to a dining room which looked like a dining hall. Not a tinge of class or history in there. Lunch was mediocre. We can get better food costing much less in restaurants in town. Description of the buildings within the compound seemed very interesting in the website but again I was disappointed. I mean they were architecturally nice traditional buildings but not as grand as I expected.
I was disappointed with the meal but may be it was lunch and the set meal that I gave have chosen is a let down. I give them the benefit of doubt that the Korean banquet and the meal with show may be better. The only thing traditional from this experience is that all the lady staff are dressed in their hanbok.

There were a few dishes that were OK, but overall they food lacked seasoning, and tasted like it was made in a hurry, like the sweet and dry bulgogi. There were only a few tables dining, those of us who were hoping the reviews of poor food would be wrong.

On the other hand, the show was very well done, even my niece and nephew enjoyed it, and they don't speak Korean.

Staffs are accommodating, friendly, and totally no issues for English communication. As I traveled with my pregnant wife, I do not have issues on asking them for those prohibited foods for her like raw meat and those with caffeine. Regarding the food, the food is great and a bit different compared to the typical menu on restaurant, thus not sure if those are actually traditional. What I remember is that the servings are small but it is a lot, and they serve it so fast that we haven't finished yet with the first one but they are already serving the 3rd dish. But i think they are doing it so you will able to finish your meal before the show starts. About the show, same with the other reviews, recommendable and very traditional. I'm about to give a perfect rating for this review because of the show, but I feel that the price is very expensive that I expect more, maybe on the food, and no extra charges on the drinks.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

259,zimonjonez,코리아하우스,1.0,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! I would give zero star if I could.,"I don't really give reviews online, but I believe visitors should stay away from this restaurant, as my experience was totally disappointing.

My wife and I went to Seoul in October 2015 for our honeymoon. Although we haven't been to South Korea before, we do enjoy plenty of authentic Korean food in Sydney.

We picked this restaurant as we saw the good reviews on the internet. However, we were extremely disappointed after having the Royal Cuisine.

Before visiting the restaurant, I made a booking via email and to make sure we could have the ""Royal Meal"". Although I've got a response saying food did not need to be ordered in advance, I was told at the restaurant that ""Royal Meal"" need to be ordered in advance...

I admit that the service was good, and good service is common in Seoul, but the food was extremely bad. The meat was rough and the food was cold. We were expecting authentic traditional Korean food, but we ended up having some westernised/fusion dishes...

The meal was a disaster not only because of the low quality of the food, but also the environment. We were lead into a room where all foreigners dinning together, while I saw Koreans were allowed to dined in spacious traditional rooms.

For all the unpleasant hours I spent in this restaurant, I was charged $350 AUD for a 4-person meal. That is very unreasonable for the quality of food provided, as a good Korean Bulgogi (BBQ) dinner for 2-person would cost less than $100 AUD in Seoul...

That said, Seoul is a great modern city and I really enjoyed staying there. This was a bad experience, but other local restaurants I've been to were extremely good. I believe this place was setup to rip off tourists...

For visitors who's travelling to South Korea and looking for a Royal Cuisine, please look somewhere else and stay away from this restaurant!","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0
260,pandjdmura,코리아하우스,5.0,Enjoyed Korean Royal Court cuisine of the Joseon Dynasty in a traditional atmosphere,"First, I want to warn you that there are two restaurants called ""Korea House"" in Seoul. Take care which ""Korea House"" entry on Trip Advisor you are looking at. I am writing about the restaurant with this phone number 82.2-2266-9101 and the web address: http://www.koreahouse.or.kr/eng/?en_skin=index.html.

That other ""Korea House"" listed within Trip Advisor has several reviews that I believe are for the restaurant we visited. The other Korea House specializes in Korean beef dishes and the menu looked very interesting, but we did not eat there. The staff was gracious dealing with our mistake and called us a taxi.

Overall, the meal, service and environment were wonderful. We arrived an hour late, and in the dark, but were welcomed with smiles from our hostess wearing a traditional Korean costume. We were lead through a large patio area where dances and other programs are conducted during the day. On the far side we ascended a set of rough stone steps and followed a cobble stone path to the building we would dine in. It was very impressive and the landscape lighting made it even more so.
There are several separate buildings and if you sign up for a court cuisine dinner, you will be seated in your own dinning room. My daughter in law was concerned about my back and knees and asked that we be seated at a table rather than eating laying on the floor. When our hostess slid the door back of our dinning room the table was low, but the space under the table was hollow, allowing us to sit normally on padded seats that had backs. Very comfortable!

The dinner is very similar to ordering from a ""tasting menu"" at a nice restaurant.
There are several courses depending on the meal you choose. We had the Eojin Jeongchan dinner. It is pricey, but you are paying for the experience as well as the gourmet food. Follow the link I provided above, click on ENGLISH, and look at Royal Cuisine to see the menu. All of it was delicious and the experience was fun. Our waitress, dressed in the traditional costume, spoke good English and was very helpful, attentive, and did not seem perturbed in the least we arrived an hour late.

I don't know when I will have an opportunity to return to Seoul, but the full experience of this place was worth the stop. If you time it better than we did, you can also attend a theater production following the meal. See the website for details.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

262,DownVegasTown,코리아하우스,5.0,Traditional Joseon Dynasty meal and show,"We truly enjoyed the meal, service and show. It was one of my favorite experiences in our 17 night trip to Korea. My wife is Korean and researched the menus and shows on the Korean website. Since I am a picky eater, we chose the Haerin Jeongsik menu. A little more expensive but very good. we accompanied the meal with a couple bottles of Bek Se Ju which became my go to drink for the rest of the trip.

A quote from their website: The traditional court cuisine of Korea House is cooked on the basis of the records contained in ancient literature. The foods are cooked by superior chefs at Korea House under the supervision of 'Han Bok-ryeo' who has been designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 38 for his expert knowledge about the court cuisine of the Joseon Dynasty).

Service freindly and outstanding. Maybe due to the constant delivery of new dishes throughout the meal and my wife's ability to communicate in Korean if they didn't understand my Texan. All the staff were dressed in traditional Hanboks.

We enjoyed the show and would see it again, given the opportunity. I particularly like the instruments and sounds they made. One selection was 4 drummers on stage playing together and putting on quite a show. I also like the dancers and the way their dresses shape while spinning around. All seemed very graceful in their movement.

After the show, the performers were in the lobby for people to take photos with them.

We took tons of photos but unfortunately they are still on the phones. Go to http://www.koreahouse.or.kr/eng/?en_skin=index.html for more info on food and show.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The food served are in small portions and you can expect up to 10 varieties of traditional food served one after another by girls clad in hangboks. You may not know what you have been served and the best thing to do is to ask the waitresses on what and how best to eat it. As expected the meals can be very pricey.

266,Kidkong,코리아하우스,5.0,Korean BBQ at it's best and most expensive!!,"Korea House is known for it's great service and quiet settings. You pay a premium for the location. And the restaurant is only made up of private rooms so I recommend reservations, but usually they can squeeze a party of four.

The side dishes are usually exquisite here, the beef is of the best quality. Though for basically the same quality you can literally walk about 100 meters to Saebyuk-jib and eat good meat. But you are paying a premium here for the privacy and small touches. For example the charcoal that they use is not preheated and they light in front of you since they are using a very good quality of charcoal.

Ask the waitress for the best cuts of meat that are available at the moment and they will recommend for you. As each day quality can vary.

They also have a dried fish (bori-geul-bi) with a green tea soup with rice to finish the meal. You take your hot rice and drop it in your cold green tea bowl. Take a piece of the dried fish that is broken up for you and dip it in the sauce they give and immediately eat the rice that was mixed with the green tea soup. It is fabulous.

I enjoy the dish so much that I visit the restaurant for the dried fish during lunch time and skip the BBQ.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

Aside from soy sauce, they have a red sauce available which compliments any hot dish.

They do have table top hibachi available if you want to cook the BBQ meat yourself.

My wife had the Dolsot Bibimbap which is a veggie mix with Kimchi in a hot bowl. It also had an egg in it. I had the Sundubu Tziigae that is a hot pot with seafood and tofu. The taste was great but only 1 shrimp, 1 piece of squid and a tiny piece of probably octopus. They did refill the little dishes of kimchi items; service was very good. Overall I felt the quality and portions dropped. Korean dishes have been a favorite of ours for some time.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

We sat down and immediately noticed very LOUD rap music coming through the restaurant speakers. Young servers and several young people standing around kitchen doors. We asked if they would turn off the music, and they asked if we wanted to move to another table. So we moved to a table at another Korean restaurant.

For a smaller party without grills, It also has quaint private tables. The wait staff are always very cheerful and will explain in broken english what you want to order. Lovely people will serve the side dishes that are always fresh and always an incredible variety. A variety of Korean wines are offered that are served in a special sake cup. Reasonable prices and a great menu await you.

They made my hotel room smell so delightful every time the fridge door opened and I almost cried when I left the leftovers in the fridge due to a long day ahead on the road.
For someone who enjoys Korean BBQ short ribs and live/travel to Orlando or Central Florida, this is the place to go. The beef bulgogi was amazing, too. Portions were large and the appetizer of dumplings was very tasty, too. We love Korean food, though we admit we typically do not eat everything. This place is the place for someone who wants to try Korean or eats it often, in my opinion. We will be back. I will also bring a cooler and get an extra order of short ribs.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

318,bousozoku,Korea House Restaurant,4.0,"Amazing food, good service","I'd been to Korea House a number of times in the 11 years I lived in the Orlando area. As with any Korean restaurant, they stick to real Korean food. There is no Americanization for any reason. If you don't like spicy food (and I don't mean spicy like Mexican food--that's mild, actually), you're probably better to go somewhere else, but there are a couple of options safe for non-Koreans.

I travelled to the Orlando area a few days ago for the first time in four years. I got together with 3 friends and we visited Korea House. They've resolved a lot of situations since moving to the newer location north of Rangeline Road. The service was quite good. They've installed vents over a few tables to allow for Korean BBQ. Korean BBQ is where you choose ingredients and cook it at your own table.

The friends chose Gal Bi, Bul Gogi, and Pork Bul Gogi. I chose Dae Gu Jji Gae. They really, really liked the food, and being Caucasians, they don't have much experience with real Asian food. That's not a criticism--it's a fact, when places like P.F. Chang's represents itself as real Chinese food, what can you think?

I was thrilled with my Dae Gu Jji Gae, but I really dislike the fish bones. I know what's going to happen. They don't remove the meat of the fish and put it in the pot to cook. They put the fish in the pot in pieces, including the bones. Cod is typically bony anyway, so it was a good-bad choice. I scooped a bit of the broth into another bowl and let the three of them try it. They were especially surprised when I told them that it was medium spicy for real Asian food.

We had a good visit and a good meal. Korea House's owners--a family of four--care a lot about food and people. They really want you to have food you'll always love. It shows!","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae', 'bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The food was the same, the Fish soup with red chili broth was great and tasty. The kimchi soup with Tuna also very delicious but the Bibimbap a little-bit boring, too dry and no have a good taste of sesame paste as in Seoul or any city in Korea. The free appetizers is always generous portions like in many Korean style restaurant. The high light was the Cinnamon drink, a little bit too sweet for western tongue but compliment the spiciness of Korean chili paste on the dish.

We definitely did not go away hungry.

327,You Y,Korea Haus,1.0,The worst experience I have ever had in a Korean restaurant!,"The worst experience I have ever had in a Korean restaurant!

I am an Asian myself and have been in South Korea. I can say that I have had amazing Korean food everywhere in the world, but for sure NOT in this Korea Haus!

I went there with my friends and wanted to try out this Korea Haus, since our favorite Korean restaurant just moved to Charlottenburg. The food was disappointing and the price was way too high according to the size and the taste of the food. The four of us ordered four dishes, including two portions of Bulgogi, one fish soup and one noodle dish. The bulgogi cost 15€ per person, and the two portions we had were not even enough for one person to get full. There was barely anything in the fish soup, maybe four tiny pieces of fish?! The noodles were kinda OK, but did not have much flavor.

Two small side dishes came with the food. Since the four of us shared the side dish, we asked for another portion of kimchi. The waiter was nice enough to tell us that we have to pay for extra kimchi. We were surprised to hear that because ALL the normal Korean restaurants offer side dishes for free, as a custom. The waiter went to ask the owner if we could get one for free. The owner came out from the back with such an arrogant attitude and told us we cannot get one for free. He said, if we want to have free side dishes, we should go to another place. We were totally shocked and could not believe it. The owner obviously only wants money and does not care if any customers come back again or not.

Furthermore, I, for the first time, had diarrhea after having Korean food.

As a foodie, I will never go back to this place again and would also advise all Korean food lovers to avoid this place. You deserve better food and treatment for your money!","['jeyukbokkeum', 'gimbap', 'jjamppong']",0
328,virginia m,Korea Haus,4.0,surprise!,"i would have never thought that this place could reserve such a surprise!
we had the buffet (6€). we didn't eat meat but the rest was more than enough! there is a selection of korean pickles (kimchi, cucumber pickles, carrots, beets, delicious stuffed peppers and others) you can tell that they are homemade. kimtchi was not particulary strong flavoured, as i like it, but my companion preferred it like this.
the lady prepared for us freshly deep fried vegetables puffs, banana and fish fillets. I was really surprised, the fish was actually really tasty and fresh, perfectly well cooked, juicy and delicious! even the rest rest was not greasy at all.

there were a few other dishes that I haven't tried, from what i could see it was noodles in different sauces with veggies and meat. there was a hot and sour meat soup as well, and rice of course!

I was so happy of changing my mind about this little family-run restaurant. the owners really care about what they are doing, and even though they don't have many clients, whenever someone arrives they treat him like a real host at their place.

the furnishings is really heavy and peculiar, but in its own way it gives a feeling of authenticity (though not Korean! elvis was printed all over on the seats :) ). the owners seem to be there out of any pretention, if not to do the best they can to prepare good food.

i left this little place with a smile and bitterness too,for having prejudged koreas Haus as just another fake orientalish imbiss for so long before TRYING IT!

Squash is virtually non existent, golf is too expensive, but the Cinder Bar , oh the Cinder Bar. From the first moment I entered the doors of this small bar, I realised it had a huge heart. The guy who runs it tirelessly is Warren, a guy who remembers everyone’s names. The beer selection is amazing ... 12 on tap and at least 12 different bottled ales.

381,Kevin S,더 신더 바,5.0,Home away from home,"Since moving to Korea in January 2017, this is by far the best spot in the area!! There is a great mix of local, expats and travelers passing through Incheon/Songdo leading to a ""never know who you might run into"" evening.

The location is a bit hidden for a first-timer, but that adds to the mystique. Once there, the interior is intimate and welcoming. There's also additional seating upstairs and a recently added dart machine for a fun competitive game with friends. And for spring and fall, there is outdoor seating as well (you will appreciate the air conditioning indoors during the Korean summer months!). Don't miss out on the monthly Trivia Night as well for a good time with co-workers or friends.

The food, with the recently expanded menu, is always great. Remember, the Cinder Bar is a bar, so the menu is very appropriate, but don't let that fool you in terms of quality and taste! My personal favorites are the colonel chicken sandwich and wings...which remind of wings from back in the US. The burger, fish sandwich, fish & chips and fries are also favorites and give a variety of choices. Cost is very reasonable and appropriate.

On to the beer....the Cinder Bar offers a dozen or so beers on tap and countless bottled beers. The tap selection is vast from Asia-Pac to Europe to US to local craft and includes many types (pilsner, stout, IPA, porter, wheat, etc.). The whiskey selection is also extensive with many of my favorite single malt Scotches!

And lastly, the services is always phenomenal, which is the main reason I return. Warren, the owner, and his staff are always welcoming to both regulars and first time visitors. He goes out of his way to introduce himself and get to know his patrons.

So if you've relocated to Songdo or happen to be passing through, I recommend an evening at the Cinder Bar.",['cocktail'],1

Cinder is run by absolute legend Warren, along with his mate Sam. These guys are hard-working, honest Kiwi blokes who always put their customers first. Warren even arranged free tickets to the baseball for me!

I’ve spent the past 6 months living in Songdo and visiting this bar on a semi-frequent basis. When I moved here I didn’t know anybody. Now I’m leaving Korea and most of the people I know have all been Cinder Bar contacts through Warren.

They show the baseball, rugby and many other sports, not to mention live bands and quiz nights. This place has all the hallmarks of a western style bar, but with a genuine Korean welcome.

Highly recommend you pay a visit any day of the week - oh and say hi to Warren and Sam for me!

384,G039260,더 신더 바,5.0,Hard to find but don't give up it's worth it.,I had a little trouble finding the place but once I did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet. Amazing! The beer was ice cold and served in good portions. Beer price was a little steep for me but I hit happy hour just right so I got a bit of a break. Totally satisfied. Pro tip if you are trying to find it: if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it's on the left side of the street before the bridge. It's in a bit of an alcove in a housing development. Set back off the road a tad. There's a sign the points left and I made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road. Unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it. Obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it's the first set of building after the bridge on the right. The staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice. The fish and chips are phenomenal. Did I mention the fish and chips are great. You should definitely try the fish and chips.,['cocktail'],1

Primarily because it is one of the few true Expat Pubs in all of Incheon. The Kiwi, Warren, runs the Pub, and he was most hospitable. We settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely. Even had time for some fish and chips: the fish was covered in golden batter, and the chips were delicious. The bar looks a little broken down (as was the area it was located in), but that added to the charm. If it was a rugby night, you could watch the TV, but it would've been a bit of a squeeze. There was also an upstairs, loft-style area.
Overall, a pleasant evening after work.",['cocktail'],1

Warren and his new partner Sam have crafted this cozy establishment into a welcoming, warm and friendly place to have a nice meal and a brew or two. If you are in the mood, they also have a superior selection of single malt whiskeys. The prices are the best you will find in Incheon and the atmosphere is unmatched. The food is excellent as well. This is a family affair and Warren's wife is the establishment's cook. Of particular note is the new hamburger offered which is a new collaboration between Warren and ""The Flying Chef"".

Despite being born in New Zeeland he has lived in Korea long enough to speak fluent Korean.

Mix these things together and you get a bar that performs, where the seats are always warm because nobody wants to leave. Awesome place.

547,Kevin S,더 신더 바,5.0,Home away from home,"Since moving to Korea in January 2017, this is by far the best spot in the area!! There is a great mix of local, expats and travelers passing through Incheon/Songdo leading to a ""never know who you might run into"" evening.

The location is a bit hidden for a first-timer, but that adds to the mystique. Once there, the interior is intimate and welcoming. There's also additional seating upstairs and a recently added dart machine for a fun competitive game with friends. And for spring and fall, there is outdoor seating as well (you will appreciate the air conditioning indoors during the Korean summer months!). Don't miss out on the monthly Trivia Night as well for a good time with co-workers or friends.

The food, with the recently expanded menu, is always great. Remember, the Cinder Bar is a bar, so the menu is very appropriate, but don't let that fool you in terms of quality and taste! My personal favorites are the colonel chicken sandwich and wings...which remind of wings from back in the US. The burger, fish sandwich, fish & chips and fries are also favorites and give a variety of choices. Cost is very reasonable and appropriate.

On to the beer....the Cinder Bar offers a dozen or so beers on tap and countless bottled beers. The tap selection is vast from Asia-Pac to Europe to US to local craft and includes many types (pilsner, stout, IPA, porter, wheat, etc.). The whiskey selection is also extensive with many of my favorite single malt Scotches!

And lastly, the services is always phenomenal, which is the main reason I return. Warren, the owner, and his staff are always welcoming to both regulars and first time visitors. He goes out of his way to introduce himself and get to know his patrons.

So if you've relocated to Songdo or happen to be passing through, I recommend an evening at the Cinder Bar.",['cocktail'],1

Cinder is run by absolute legend Warren, along with his mate Sam. These guys are hard-working, honest Kiwi blokes who always put their customers first. Warren even arranged free tickets to the baseball for me!

I’ve spent the past 6 months living in Songdo and visiting this bar on a semi-frequent basis. When I moved here I didn’t know anybody. Now I’m leaving Korea and most of the people I know have all been Cinder Bar contacts through Warren.

They show the baseball, rugby and many other sports, not to mention live bands and quiz nights. This place has all the hallmarks of a western style bar, but with a genuine Korean welcome.

550,G039260,더 신더 바,5.0,Hard to find but don't give up it's worth it.,I had a little trouble finding the place but once I did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet. Amazing! The beer was ice cold and served in good portions. Beer price was a little steep for me but I hit happy hour just right so I got a bit of a break. Totally satisfied. Pro tip if you are trying to find it: if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it's on the left side of the street before the bridge. It's in a bit of an alcove in a housing development. Set back off the road a tad. There's a sign the points left and I made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road. Unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it. Obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it's the first set of building after the bridge on the right. The staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice. The fish and chips are phenomenal. Did I mention the fish and chips are great. You should definitely try the fish and chips.,['cocktail'],1

Primarily because it is one of the few true Expat Pubs in all of Incheon. The Kiwi, Warren, runs the Pub, and he was most hospitable. We settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely. Even had time for some fish and chips: the fish was covered in golden batter, and the chips were delicious. The bar looks a little broken down (as was the area it was located in), but that added to the charm. If it was a rugby night, you could watch the TV, but it would've been a bit of a squeeze. There was also an upstairs, loft-style area.

We've been here quite a few times and haven't been too lucky. We check out Trip Advisor and guess who's #1, Cinder Bar! We're reading the reviews and Warren, the owner's name keeps popping up. We head out to find The Cinder Bar.
We walk in and are instantly greeted by, guess who? Warren! He is one passionate and friendly man. He wants us to enjoy ourselves. The music was so great. We were hungry and he recommended a few items and they were delicious.
Warren is known for his famous gin and tonic, I'm not a fan of gin. He insisted we try just one, which we shared. I slurped it down and now I like gin and tonics.
We ordered his homemade dip and chips, chicken wings and fish and chips. All very, very good.

Warren has made an excellent atmosphere and the customers were all in on it. I arrived alone but left with the intention of going back and continuing to meet great people.

Warren, the owner, gave our Uber driver directions on how to get to the bar (20 min from the airport). Kitchen open late for fish/chips and wings. Great alcohol selection (IPA imported from the U.S. on tap!) Great spot and will come back next time we have an overnight layover on Delta or Korean Air. Great mix of locals and expats. A must see on the the way through.",['cocktail'],1
643,Crespie,더 신더 바,5.0,Great selection friendly environment,"In Town for a conference and spent some time searching for a place to have a drink. Uncovered Cinders after a detailed search but surprised that they weren't top of the search.

Owner, Warren, an extremely friendly and welcoming host! A range of beers to cater for taste and an even better selection of spirits for even the most discerning palate.

I started with a malty indiga (American craft) served with some dubiously crunchy (typically Korean) nuts and graduated through Guinness and Stella Artois to an extremely reasonably priced local lager. Even a selection of Scottish beers and islay malt whiskeys for the more selective drinker.

Would highly recommend the venue to anyone!",['cocktail'],1

658,Dizzy Jay R,Korean BBQ,1.0,"Frozen meat, frozen staff, cold restaurant","Very disappointing.
We arrived Sunday late afternoon, the staff could not have been more disinterested. Despite only a few tables occupied the waitress was more interested in talking to other staff members than take our order.
The restaurant was physically cold. A couple at the next table had to put on their outdoor coats after ordering.
The (electric) grill took an age to warm up, and when the food arrived (full meat platter) half of it was still frozen, obviously previously band saw freezer cut -- no marinade. For a restaurant that claims to be a barbaque, the meat was given shockingly no thought, oddly butchered cuts that could not be cooked without undercooking one half or overcooking the other.

Service continued to be at best minimal. The grill was occasionally manned by a member of staff (taking away the one gimmick the style of cuisine has) who left without any word. When we took to cooking our own cuts of meat, we were sternly told on how to operate the grill as we obviously missed the 12 week preparatory course for dining.

We left with most of the meal uneaten- the waitress did not ask why or if the meal was saitisfactory. I'd like to personally apologise for interrupting her 8 hour paid social club.

If the idea of being exposed to cooking yourself is some kind of wild evening entertainment and you don't mind that there are far better places to actually eat, I'd highly recommend ""Korean BBQ"".",Korean BBQ,1

663,479karine,Korean BBQ,1.0,Birthday,Started off goodish they took full order then 5 mins later said had no chicken skewers for starters so we both took chicken dumplings then while ordering food started telling me I was ordering too much I was ordering for 3 people strange. The dumplings were good except one person asked for veg dumpling but got chicken. It’s a birthday she didn’t complain then the bbq food started to arrive but one of hot plates would only go to number two a warm setting when we complained as food was poaching not browning were told they knew it was broken so just use other one for 8 people we asked to move then every member of staff stood round our table telling us it will heat up give it time eventually they tried to intimidate us with restaurant and kitchen crew huddling round us. They said give us 2 separate tables then they were shouting tried to move another table threw the cooking food on top of the raw food aggressively....at that point we said we wanted to leave and they had spoiled his birthday. We found a better staffed restaurant to celebrate and will never eat there again.,Korean BBQ,1

I tried bbq sets and bulgogi dishes so far. They were always really tasty. Last time I got beef bulgogi, seafood pancake (that I adore) and a soup. Everything was just great. Little space, so if you don't book sometimes it's a bit of a risk. But it's really easy to book online. The service was great, everyone always friendly and welcoming. really nice a cosy atmosphere.

No one really explained why. We ordered 1 starter which came very quickly as did the drinks. My main came 10 mins before my husbands but I assume as his was fried this was the reason for the delay. No one explained why. The food was very tasty, drinks a good variety and reasonably priced. Cannot really comment on staff as not a lot of interaction. After our mains we asked for the bill as it was 7:40 and did not look at desert/coffee menu. Would definitely come back but would reserve a table at a less busy time.",Korean BBQ,0

The lettuce, sauces and sides were topped up for free. The service was excellent with frequent grill changes and the food compared favourably to bbq I have eaten in South Korea. My partner very much enjoyed his first Korean bbq and would come again. I was initially a bit apprehensive as it was empty (at 5pm) and doesn't have a great exterior but I am glad we came in. Highly recommended, I just wish we'd had space for the kimchi pancake!",Korean BBQ,1
672,Martin H,Korean BBQ,3.0,A bit disorganised,"I'm in two minds about this place. Staff were friendly, it was packed and some of the food was very nice and the salads plentiful. The first time in the UK that I've tasted kimchi which actually had some kick to it. The pudding menu is very limited but some really unusual flavours - black sesame or red bean ice cream anyone? However some of the meat wasn't well cut & was therefore awkward on the barbeque and the overall value of the barbeque was poorer tan some I've had. Dishes arrived a little haphazardly and one a couple of times things were forgotten though came quickly after a prompt. Overall a pleasant evening but wouldn't go out of my way to come here again when there is so much other choice in the city.",Korean BBQ,0

675,MikeFromEdinburgh,Korean BBQ,3.0,Not great. Poor choice. Friendly but not wonderful service. Food was average at best.,"I've had Korean BBQ before. Its not really my thing since I can cook reasonably well at home so there's little fun in doing this in a restaurant. However my teenage daughters fondness for K-Pop made her ask to go here. We went. Table was OK. Place was light and airy. We saw about twelve ingredients on display for the customers to add to their meals. Soy and chili, coriander, spring onions, oyster sauce, two red bean sauces and so on. Nothing really exotic and nothin particularly Korean. Supermarkets have most of these ingredients nowadays. We ordered tempura starters and although huge and expensive for starters they weren't awfully good. Tempura batter was darker, oilier and heavier than the best I've had. Particularly for the prawns. My veg tempura was a little better but still not great. We ordered beef mains. Meagre portions considering other places in Edinburgh offer more variety. We got three bowls of lukewarm sticky rice which was more ""badly made"" than actually sticky. I can make better at home and I expect better from restaurants. I won't come here again. The Korean beer we wanted was out of stock. Our starters arrived several minutes apart and the nice waiting staff told me the kitchen was busy. There was about ten more diners in the place than we three. We had pints of Diet Coke each. Bill was pricey for what we received although average for the typical fare. Sadly this place was below par.",Korean BBQ,0
676,DaveMcD101,Korean BBQ,5.0,Amazing,Fantastic meal. Ordered a verity of marinated meats along with some sides. Fantastic food.

The beef BBQ I ordered was way too salty and the some was the meat was not marinated. The amount of meat was too little in comparison to its price and other Korean restruants in the city.

The waiters were not friendly and when the chef came out to greet us, he was really...odd and we felt really uncomfortable due to his attitude towards us.

We ordered set D, which was a great combination of really fresh meat and was great if you're not sure what to order. The side dishes were delicious too, especially the salad and the marinated beansprouts, and the sauce was so tasty. We ordered rice as well, but it really wasn't necessary as the set itself is a very generous portion for 2 hungry full-grown men! I have, sadly, never been to Korea, but I have eaten at barbecue restaurants in the Korean district of Tokyo and this competes with the best of them.

We just randomly walked in, seeing many people there so we really thought this should be a good place for food. However, the food there made us soooo disappointed. We ordered four dishes and none of them tasted okay. The BBQ source was so weird and the beef was not fresh at all! As for the beef soup, I would say they destroyed every thing. It was so slight and there was not enough ingredients inside. All in all, I don’t recommend it. This restaurant is unqualified.",Korean BBQ,0

690,A M,Korean BBQ,3.0,"Good food, but mixed service","We ate at this Korean BBQ Restaurant the other night with friends (You cook your own food if you pick a BBQ dish).
Service was very mixed, girl waitress was excellent, organised and efficient, but the other staff not quite so, some were just lazy. Asked to get table cleared after main course, as they left it on table for 20 mins, even though the restaurant was quieter. The youngest staff cleared 1/4 of table, after requested, then proceeded to stand around and do nothing for next 10 mins. Eventually got table cleared, including glasses with wine remaining in them, after requesting again. Awful attention to guests.
Food was a different case. BBQ chicken was a generous portion, BBQ Prawns not so, only 6 medium prawns for the money. Stir-Fry was generous portion and tasty.
Restaurant really has to sort out service, as we left thinking there are better Korean BBQ restaurants near-by, so why would we go here again.
Tip should be given in cash, if added to VISA, staff do not get it, owner told me which is fair enough. If cash they get it (Legal requirement in UK anyway).",Korean BBQ,1

693,720leannt,Korean BBQ,5.0,Great food!,"Three of us went for dinner, having the kimchi pancake (very generous with the kimchi, and not too spicy if that’s something you’re worried about), the BBQ Set D and the Naengmyun (Cold noodles in a vinegar broth). The pancake was delicious and probably the best I have had outside of Korea! And the set includes a variety of 5 cuts of meat (the pork neck slice is especially tender and delicious) and 2 beers of your choice, this was an extremely generous portion and undoubtedly worth the price - a great option if you’re new to KBBQ and aren’t sure what cuts to order. The set also comes with all you need for Ssam (lettuce wraps) and the side dishes are also of a great quality (and are refilled for free if you ask). The naengmyun is also probably the best I’ve ever had, I highly recommend!! The service was great - very attentive and friendly, explaining how to use the bbq and changing out the grill halfway through to a cleaner one (something I was very impressed by, as many Korean restaurants don’t do that in the U.K).

697,emmacraggs,Korean BBQ,5.0,Outstanding meal in an incredible atmosphere,"Haven't tried Korean food in a Korean restaurant before, and was thoroughly impressed.
We visited on a Saturday evening but however, I DID NOT reserve a table. So my advice would be to do so as it was busy. I managed to get a slot at 8 o'clock and eagerly returned.
The atmosphere was electric, the bbq's which acted as a lively centrepiece for each table, were producing an enticing aroma which elevated our appetite.
We ordered the sirloin to BBQ and the rice cakes. The sirloin was nicely marbled and marinated in a delicious sauce. It was served with lettuce leaves, kimchi, salad and bean sprouts. All were delectable.
The rice cakes were chewy and tasty. Perhaps a little too sweet for my liking as I prefer hot, spicy food but still so delicious.
We got octopus balls and dumplings for starters which were both so incredibly yummy.
Nothing was disappointing. I can't say a bad word. All customers were smiling and laughing. The staff were incredibly helpful and polite. The pricing was extremely fair.
An excellent meal and a great introduction to Korean cooking.",Korean BBQ,1

699,760donc,Korean BBQ,5.0,Friday night dinner,Out in Edinburgh for a gig and decided to try something a wee bit different than the usual pub grub and have to say I was very impressed with what was our first ever Korean BBQ. We went for the the BBQ set meal D for 2 which came with to beers and prices at £38:80 was great value for what was served up. The only thing that we made a mistake on was not ordering side dishes of rice/noodles as wasn’t sure what the set meal came with..lol the Wee bbq plate in the middle of the table was quick to heat up and did not make the dining area to hot to enjoy your meal. The marinaded beef slice was outstanding and watch out for the chicken as it’s bloody spicy (well for my mouth anyway..lol) this restaurant is very busy and we were lucky to get a table for 2 not long after opening time so I would suggest phoning to make a reservation to make sure you’re not disappointed..,Korean BBQ,1

706,sullko,Korean BBQ,5.0,Amazing food at a great price - great night out!,"One of the best Korean BBQs I've visited - their bulgogi marinade is absolutely on point, and the kimchi pancake was wonderful.

We ordered the mixed meats set menu for 2 and were treated to a quick overview of how to cook our food (we'd been to a Korean BBQ before so didn't need the full demonstration). Our grill plate was frequently refreshed, and all the meat was absolutely top quality. The pancake appetizer took awhile to come out, but we were given a bowl of amazingly tangy kimchi to make up for the wait - perfect spice, great texture and flavour.

The staff is charming and helpful and the food was perfectly composed.

Finish off your lettuce and sauces? No problem - they'll bring you more right away!

If you enjoy cooking and like to ""play with your food,"" this is a perfect night out. Just be sure to come with an appetite - that set meal for 2 is really enough for 3 or even 4 people!!",Korean BBQ,1

708,xlavayukix,Korean BBQ,5.0,As authentic as yo can get!,"I'm a huge fan of Korean food and have been in too many Korean restaurants to count in many cities (Dublin, Tokyo, Osaka, Austria, London, Manchester, Seoul etc..), and this one is a definite 5 star. It was very authentic, we were also the only two non-Korean people in the entire restaurant which was full and booked out for the night, which must mean that this place is the real deal!

We ordered the Kimchi pancake and tofu bibimbap, both of which tasted just like in Korea, I savoured every bite! Not all Korean restaurants outside Korea seem to give the complimentary starters, but Korean BBQ does, which was great.

The prices were standard, each main ranging around £10-12. The service was efficient and good, no complaints.

A word of warning, this place is extremely popular, even on weekdays. We came on a Saturday to find it booked out so I made a reservation the following Monday online, which was ok. While we were there, the place was a full house and the waitress was turning down those without reservations as it was booked out until around 8:30pm.

The online booking is easy and quick, it fills up fast. I booked two days in advance for a Monday night, and the latest available was 6:30pm, with nothing available any later. So I advise booking quite a bit in advance or be ready to eat either early or late, as the 7-9pm times seem to get taken fast as the restaurant is small and seems to be very popular with Koreans in Edinburgh as well as tourists and locals.",Korean BBQ,1
709,Anna M,Korean BBQ,4.0,"Great food, good value","We had a reservation but turned out it wasn't needed. The food was great, overall good value, the service could've been a bit faster. The kimchi was a bit more sour than spicy and not as crunchy, but it's up to personal taste. I think they could serve kimchi as a complimentary sider to the bbq, as they would also in Korea. Some music would be nice.",Korean BBQ,1
710,1313mark,Korean BBQ,5.0,Fun and great food,"We really enjoyed our dinner here, The hostess/owner was great, we ordered the platter for two that included two beers, My wife does not drink beer, so it was a win win. The food was flavorful and fresh, and we had fun cooking it. Our server refilled the vegetable sides as needed . Well worth the money",Korean BBQ,1
711,Jay M,Korean BBQ,4.0,Solid Korean food in the heart of Edinburgh,This is one of your typical grill your own Korean places. Meat is fresh. Portions are large and the prices are reasonable. Only 3 sides with the meat less than what I usually get. They could also use another server but overall a good non tourist experience.,Korean BBQ,1
712,FlameOfFrost,Korean BBQ,4.0,Very tasty first experience,"My friend visited from the USA, where there are many Korean BBQ places. She took me here to experience it and we were very happy. Food is good, very filling, and the staff are friendly. When we arrived we were told the small restaurant was full, but instead of just turning us away the staff took my contact number and called us when a table became free. A very nice idea, meaning we could explore a bit more!",Korean BBQ,1
713,saltsugarspice27,Korean BBQ,5.0,A bit of Korean BBQ experience.,I love this place and remind me a BBQ place in Daegu that I used to go to. The meat choices are great and we had a lot of fun cooking and it’s a good chat. Waiter was so kind to offer extra salad if we needed more. Side salads taste great. Will recommend.,Korean BBQ,1
714,igal27,Korean BBQ,5.0,"Very tasty food, friendly staff, and an overall great dining experience","I had never been to a ""Korean BBQ"" before, so the entire experience was new to us. Luckily the staff is very friendly and helpful, and they were there to assist us in ""preparing"" our meal! You have a heating plate built into the center of each table, on which you ""barbecue"" your own food (meat, prawns, etc.), or you can order one of the prepared stir-fried dishes. One of us had the BBQ, and the other got stir-fried. We both extremely enjoyed our meals. Whether you have stir-fried or BBQ, the ""Korean way"" of eating it is by placing some of your cooked meal on a lettuce leaf, adding some of the condiments they bring you (spicy radish/bean sprouts/sauce), rolling it up, and eating the roll. Very tasty, and a fun/interesting way to eat, to boot! The prices were also quite reasonable. Highly recommended!",Korean BBQ,1
715,Jimmy A,Korean BBQ,5.0,Very good restaurant!,We were there with 13 guys. We ordered a mix of meat and fish and that was very good. The people were very friendly and gave us good information about the menu's. We've been twice now!,Korean BBQ,1
716,Polymath59,Korean BBQ,4.0,Great Korean food that you barbecue at the table,"Although it is an electric bbq in the centre of the table, this is still a great experience. Good menu with choices with selections for two that was adequate for three of us. Food comes raw and you cook it yourself to your liking. The grill is changed regularly so you don’t have to deal with burnt scraps. Although the waiter was attentive in that respect, they were a bit slow with us having to ask to clear the table, ask for the dessert menu, ask to order our dessert and then ask for the bill only to have go to the counter to pay in order to get our taxi. However, would still recommend that you give it a try.",Korean BBQ,1
717,VeniVediAmavi_185,Korean BBQ,5.0,Fantastic find - thanks to Tripadvisor!,"If it wasn’t for the reviews of this place we wouldn’t have tried it.

Looks not a lot from the exterior but the whole experience of having your own personal BBQ on you table to the delicious meats you can try it was absolutely fantastic, definitely worth a visit if looking for something different!

We booked a table for around 4pm which in our opinion was a great time, not too busy and you didn’t feel rushed. staff were very helpful and even called us a taxi to the Playhouse after our meal, which was fantastic and saved us a very wet walk through the city.

If you are looking for something different from a chain restaurant and a little taste of Korean Food then definitely take a trip here - you’ll love it!",Korean BBQ,1

Great ribeye, short rib and marinated fillet. Accompanying pickled veg was excellent. Lots of soft fluffy rice. The chilli paste was very tasty as well.

If you like Korean and you love BBQ beef then give it a go. Value for money for four people.",Korean BBQ,1
722,Zoelss,Korean BBQ,4.0,A fun dining experience,"I have been twice now and both times ordered a set of mixed meats, set D I believe, to bbq. Out of this the sliced beef is defiantly the best! The goyzas are also yummy.

Unlike when I have had Korean BBQ in Asia, here there are no extractors above the tables which does lead to a slightly smokey atmosphere and you defiantly leave smelling of a garlic-y bbq.
But all in all, a great find for some fun and tasty food.",Korean BBQ,1

The staff were very friendly and accommodating and fitted us in.
At our table we opted for a couple of mixed meat cook at table bbq dishes and all the meat was great! This was more than enough for four of us. The other three opted for their own dishes which also looked very appetising!
Great little find and I’m sure I’ll be back!",Korean BBQ,1
724,Sothea45,Korean BBQ,2.0,Very disapointed,We went to this restaurant thanks to tripadvisor recommandations but we were very disapointed by the food. We ordered 2 C set (beef bbq for 2 people) and the quantity was very small. Plus the food was not very tasty... We were forced to have another D set (mixed meat for 2). This time there was enough quantity for 2 but the quality was not there... To conclude i would not recommend it. It was also a bit expensive.,Korean BBQ,0
725,Nan K,Korean BBQ,4.0,Something different,"Ate here before the theatre..a random week night in chilly Edinburgh at 6.00...no need to book, I thought. Well, as they had online booking decided I might as well and, although there was one free table, it looks like booking was a wise decision. It’s a small, cozy space with friendly staff who talked us through the menu as we had never eaten in a Korean restaurant before. Prawn starter was magnificent and easily enough for two, followed by the Korean BBQ, neatly fitted into the table top. A decent bottle of reasonably priced house wine...what’s not to like?",Korean BBQ,1
726,steadyslack,Korean BBQ,4.0,Smokey,"The smell which hits you as you walk through the door is similar to that of teriyaki which makes your mouth water!
We opted for bbq and ordered a set of mixed meats and also sliced beef accompanied by goyzas both chicken and vegetables plus an aubergine.
The bbq grill is electric and we felt was never sizzlingly hot (like in Asia where they are mostly gas powered). There are no extractors over the tables therefore the whole place is really smokey with 12 grills on the go! Your clothes will whiff.
The service was a little sporadic.
All in all pretty good for somewhere out of Asia.",Korean BBQ,1

732,Thistly_Cross,Korean BBQ,5.0,"Great quality, friendly vibe, stunning side salads!","Second visit here. Tuesday night and it's packed!
Last time, we got a BBQ for two, and starters, we only just managed to eat all this!!

This time, I opted for a stew, my ptnr went for some sort of spicy chicken thing, and we had dumpling starters and a kumchi side.

As last time, we got three different salads that came with the food, free refills of same which we made use of. Dressings in salad all different but are lovely sweet/sour/salty combos, go with everything!

Lots of Korean diners, and other folk who know their stuff, but I think you would be well looked after if you hadn't a clue - staff checked we were ok both visits, and checked if we wanted chopsticks or knife fork spoon.

Be aware that in common with many Korean restaurants, your clothes and hair will smell after!! Don't wear anything like a doen jacket that needs special cleaning.

We recently went to another, new, Korean bbq in Edinburgh but this place totally outguns it! 2 starters, 2 mains, side salads come with it, and we got a drink each, £40 total.",Korean BBQ,1

Their tempura is so tasty, I keep telling my man to go back to get more.
I would definitely recommend!",Korean BBQ,1
734,535family,Korean BBQ,5.0,Great food and lovely service,"We had the Korean BBQ (menu D) for 2 people with 2 beers each and more than we could eat, all for under £50. The waiters were so friendly and helpful showing us how to use the BBQ and talking us through all the pickles and seasoning. The food was absolutely delicious and the Korean Beer was good too. At the end the staff called us a taxi - they couldn’t do enough to help. The only thing to note is that it was cash only so make sure you take enough cash with you but definitely go! Also it really would be hard for vegetarians.",Korean BBQ,1
735,Madeline R,Korean BBQ,5.0,"Always tasty, great atmosphere!","My friends and I are regulars at KBBQ and although their normal dishes are very good, we love the Korean barbeque the most. It's super fun to cook the meat yourself, although if you're nervous the staff will jump in to help, or cook it for you if you prefer. Even as a group of students we find we can all leave full and happy for around £10-20 per person depending on how greedy we are about the meat selection! A great place to spend some quality time with friends or family and enjoy crazy tasty food all the while.",Korean BBQ,1

The menu is varied - for both carnivores and vegetarian options. We tried the barbeque at the table - and this added to the experience as well as the flavor- with staff attentive and helpful, to make sure the food was prepared properly- cooked well but not singed and smokey. Marinades flavoursome with just the right amount of bite and side veg dishes crispy and tastey. We had dumplings and seaweed salad to start. Finished with black sesame ice cream I have travelled in Asia and experienced authentic local dishes and this was on par.
Smiling staff and service was great. We will definitely return- would be good for a light lunch or as we had- a full evening meal.",Korean BBQ,1

741,dug289,Korean BBQ,5.0,Absolutely outstanding!,"This place is amazing, to say the least. We'd never been to a Korean bbq before so didn't know what to expect, but what a great experience it was and we had such a great time. we ordered beef slices, king prawns, seaweed, two portions of rice and two grape juices; all of this coming with free sides and sauces. The beef and prawns were beautifully marinated and the staff was very helpful in showing us how to cook as it was our first time. The rice was excellent and the seaweed was as well (despite not liking it much myself). Would highly recommend getting the grape juice as well if you're looking for something non-alcoholic, tasted great and even had little grapes inside the can which added to the experience of a different culture. Overall, I must say that this place is a true wonder, with a great variety of food, friendly staff and excellent little details such as the metal chopsticks and drinks being served in their original can/bottle covered in Korean/Japanese writing; and for a very filling meal we only spent £30.",Korean BBQ,1

It was super busy with no available tables on the moment we went, but waiter kindly asked us to wait for 10-15 minutes. Finally we got our table and happily ordered beef bbq set for two. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with lots of little additional dishes as in South Korea does, but one has to order for extra fee. Our bulgogi tasted well, but it wasn’t that authentic though. For me the highlight was kimchi, that tasted very different from packaged ones. Waiters were quick and polite, thumbs up for them. Also it felt a bit expensive for what you get. Oh, and bare in mind your clothes will be soaked with smelly smoke for days, as everyone is grilling it’s own meat and there are no smoke extractors, unfortunately.",Korean BBQ,0

We also got an order of Kim, Kimchi and Hot Beef Soup to share. We loved it all. The beef selection came with three types and they gave us three sides/lettuce/sesame oil with salt and chili paste. All were YUMMM. I had to order white rice as it doesn't come with the order, which from other places I've been to globally that was weird. My water glass came out with food on it, which was gross, but the server replaced it. We asked for a pitcher of water, but that never came. When it came time to pay it was hard to get a server and the restaurant at this point was not full. I would recommend the food and would go back for the food but the service could do a bit better.

Green Tea Ice cream was yummm and on point to what we had in Japan.",Korean BBQ,1

After a rough day of pulling suitcases up and down hills to get to our hotel, we had a delicious meal at this place. Food tasted fresh, staff was friendly and place was very clean. The only down side to this place and why I gave 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because they only took cash on the day we went. Not sure if this is a usual thing but they at least knew where the closest ATM machine was. Overall great place would definitely recommend it and would go back if we ever returned.",Korean BBQ,1
756,bblue88,Korean BBQ,3.0,"Okay, but a bit bland","A nice atmosphere and good to see a Korean BBQ in Edinburgh this concept has potential if the food improves. Food was edible and pleasant enough, but I feel the chicken dish I ordered was miss sold by the waitress, she warned me the dish I ordered was very spicy, however, it was actually tasteless and bland not a hint of flavour or spice in my opinion.
Also the side dishes weren't very authentic and options to buy more sides were very limited e.g the only noodle option is udon.
If you're looking for good Korean in Edinburgh I'd recommend sodaeng as the best. Hope Korean BBQ is able to improve on authentic Korean flavours as I liked the look and feel of this restaurant.",Korean BBQ,1

759,baronynine,Korean BBQ,1.0,Cash Only,"Book a table well in advance, get e- mail confirmation.

Take train into Edinburgh, travel light with cash for a few beers, card to pay for meal.

Go see a Festival show in George Street and then 15 minute walk up to Tarvit Street.

Table ready for us, sit down handed menus, all good so far.

Just about to order and the wife spots the ""cash only"" sign at the till at the back of the restaurant. We ask the waitress if it was indeed cash only and she says ""network was down"".

Only have card with me so we have to sheepishly leave the restaurant.

Fair enough that the network was down (a first for me) but surely they could have emailed or phoned us to let us know?

As the Festival was on everywhere was full so had to head back to the train station hungry

761,GarethClaase,Korean BBQ,5.0,"Great food, value and staff","Tiny bit off the main thoroughfare, and the frontage I think conceals a bit that the interior is really quite nice, but not to be missed.

Korean bbq is great because there's nothing like cooking the meat yourself then popping it in your mouth while it's still toasty hot. Vegetables also cook nicely too.

Staff were charming and very attentive. Nice touch that the chef popped out to check on everyone. Really surprised at the bill given how much meat we ate. We didn't drink much but it still felt good value.

We had the assorted meats bbq, and it was all great. Marinaded strips of beef were particularly nice. Will look forward to bulgolgi and bibimbap next time (other Korean specialties).

We couldn't eat everything, and they suggested themselves that we just cook up the rest and take it home. I often wish I could do that at restaurants but I'm too embarrassed to ask.",Korean BBQ,0

Its a normal Korean bbq where you cook your own meat at the table but the staff gave great tips on the best way to do it. Great sauces and side dishes to go with the meat as well.

768,Daniel M,Korean BBQ,5.0,Closest thing to Korea in Scotland,"Visited with some friends recently after we'd all come back from working in South Korea and were missing the food.

Stepping inside and first getting that aroma we felt instantly back in Busan!

First off the staff were incredibly friendly and took loads of time to speak to us and were always on hand with anything we needed - even showing the correct way to make a so-maek (?)

The food was outstanding and I honestly don't think you'll find a better representation of the BBQ atmosphere of Korean restaurants in Scotland, or even the rest of the UK for that matter.

We had the assorted meat platter with some soup and it was plenty for 4. We also got some kimchi and again it's much better than you can buy in the shops.

No Korean night out would be complete without some Hite and some Soju and thankfully they have both ;o)

All in all we had a great night there due to a combination of fantastically attentive staff
And delicious food all in a great relaxed atmosphere.

They were so good. Great service, made us feel so comfortable and were always keeping a check in case we weren't sure about the BBQ. The chef had also come out once to check the bbq.

It had a good buzzing atmosphere and service was excellent which makes such a difference. Staff were friendly, helpful explaining how the BBQ worked and they all looked like they wanted to be there. BBQ was excellent and very reasonably priced. You can get just pork or beef or a mixed one. We got the mixture of pork, beef, chicken and came with 2 beers for £38. The experience and the meat itself was fantastic especially the sauces and the pickled vegetables- the marinated chicken and beef bulgogi were devine. If you're on the Atkins diet no danger here as the meats and vegetables are plentiful with no carbs in sight

Would highly recommend",Korean BBQ,1
772,jon0269,Korean BBQ,4.0,Great Korean right next to the King's Theatre,"We went here for lunch just a few minutes after it opened at 12 so we were the first in. Friendly welcome, quick service, tasty Korean food. Worth a visit.",Korean BBQ,1
773,Nimes F,Korean BBQ,5.0,Great dining experience,"Like some other comments, I experienced a Korean BBQ whilst in Tokyo many many years ago, and have wanted to experience it again but have been unable to find one in Scotland. I then found the Korean BBQ on the tripadvisor website and immediately visited.
I ordered a mixed meat set meal. The waiter suggested that this was a 3 person serving but since there were 2 of us, they would pack the remainder for take-away.

The mixed meat plater is accompanied by an array of side dishes from salad leaves to chilli paste. The platter itself held many differently marinaded cuts of meat (chicken pork and beef) All raw for you to cook yourself on the bbq grill situated in the centre of the table.

The meats were delicious and as we did not finish, the waiter packed up the remaining uneaten cook meats. We accompanies the meal with korean beer which was the perfect match.

For the uninitiated, this as a really fun way to dine, and something everone should try. It can get busy at the usual eating times so booking is advised. We ate after the lunchtime rush so was easy to get a table. I've already made a reservation for next Saturday and looking forward to it.
One last interesting point, the bbq meal consists of meats and veg so a carb free option, making it both delicious and healthy. A seafood option is available also.

Check it out, you will love it.",Korean BBQ,1
774,ScotsGlobeTrotters,Korean BBQ,5.0,Fabulous authentic food and love staff - will be rushing back!,"The staff greeted us warmly checking if we eaten at the restaurant and / or Korean food before...No and Yes. They asked if we needed help with the menu and also brought out complimentary sides which are also refilled for free which is a wonderful idea....not just because they're complimentary but because they tasted divine!!
It was my mum's first time eating Korean food and now recognises there was no need for apprehension. Every morsal was heavenly - our only disappointment was it was a light pre theatre dinner and we wanted to try more. 1st rate kimchi, salads are so flavoursome, the hot pot was amazing and katsu curry spot on.
I can't wait to come back for a full on bbq feast and try lots more. And its such an important note, the staff were friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there which is so refreshing. A real gem of a restaurant",Korean BBQ,1
775,Sarah M,Korean BBQ,4.0,Perfect pre-theatre Asian food,"My son and I visited after his ortho appointment for a lunch treat. I'm on a low-carb diet just now and have to be a picky eater. Korean BBQ was perfect as they brought suitable nibbles, then I had a pork belly kim chi soup with a side of rice (we took away) which was satisfyingly spicy and delicious. My son had chicken katsu (his favourite) and rice and said it was really good.
Service was lovely, small business, chef/owner, and great decor. Very reasonable price.
This little place is tucked at the side of the King's Theatre and so easy to miss, but don't. This food is perfect for pre-theatre as it's not heavy and so less likely to induce that post-supper soporific state so fatal in a darkened theatre space...
Definitely returning to do the whole BBQ thing.",Korean BBQ,1

782,Prism11,Korean BBQ,4.0,"Good flavor, not perfect","BBQ'd meats were delicious (we had the squid and pork). Not rating this a 5 due to mediocre starters and lack of traditional banchan (all the small plates that typically come with a Korean meal). We were also asked if we wanted rice, which I found strange since that's expected with a traditional meal. Service was nice and expedient. Would still gladly return for the delicious flavor of the BBQ!",Korean BBQ,1
783,GyNLff,Korean BBQ,5.0,"Great quality and experience, is a must!","We went there because we already knew about the Korean Barbeque, and when we saw it walking around the area we thought to come and try it, and it was an amazing success.

We ordered a Seafood pancake, Chicken Gyoja, a Kimchi side (to try it since it is something typical from Korea) and the Mo Dum Gu I (Assorted meat bbq selection). Everything was really good. The seafood pancake was nothing special, but it was nice and tasty, more pancake flavour than seafood, but it was nice overall. The chicken gyoja were really nice, the Kimchi side is something you have to try at least once, and it was something spicy, crunchy, fresh and with a lot of flavour, even though is a side measure, it is quite a nice portion, so keep in mind if you just want to try it. And the best for us was the Mo Dum Gu (we got the Assorted meat bbq menu that includes salads), it comes with 2 sauces, one spicy and delicious and another of sesame that it was also really good, also comes with lettuce to make wraps (and when we ran out of lettuce they brought us more without charging for it), it also comes with some salads to fill your wraps or eat them alone, delicious, spicy and tasty. And the meat selection is top notch, everything was really nice but our favourites were the Pork neck slice and the Darkgalbi, both of them marinated. It includes also 2 beers or 2 soft drinks, but as we were ordering a bottle of wine, Pinot Grigio Veneto, we didn't ordered them. They brought to us some special radish to taste and include in the wraps for free, it was really good and it fits perfectly with the pork belly wraps.

Since it was rather late and we were quite full we decided not to order any dessert but we will do for sure the next time.

The waitress and the waiter were friendly, helpful and professional, they didn't step in too much in our table and we didn't have to wait for anything, they were really attentive and smiling.

Since we had a lot of food with sauces and we were eating slow, we got replaced our grills twice, but it was made with the best of the attitude and they were not intrusive or disturbing at all.

The experience was amazing, we will come back for sure and try other dishes and desserts.

As recommendation for the staff, you could put a sign on the corner of the street to make more noticeable your place, because you deserve all the possible attendance and success.

Cheers!

I enjoyed the tasty food - from an excellent choice of dishes, but loved the intimate feel of this cosy restaurant. We went early on opening (5pm) and very soon after we could see how popular this place is with young couples.

I have tried a few Korean restaurants in Edinburgh and this place is actually good.
Ordered three dishes and all of them are really tasty. We(two of us) cleared all of them. Fine dishes! Loved it. I gave 4 stars for two reasons: 1. Parking can be a nightmare 2.Price is slightly higher than other restaurants. Am I going back? For sure!

796,Madfortripad89,Korean BBQ,1.0,This restaurant does NOT cater to dietary requirements,"We had a very disappointing evening here. I have to follow a gluten-free diet and my friend stated in advance in her email booking that there would be two people who had to eat gluten free. The menu online also says that dietary requirements should be made clear to the waiters.

When we were ordering we asked the waiter which of the dishes could be made gluten free and which dishes should be avoided. The waiter did not know what gluten free meant and what wheat was when we tried to describe the dietary requirement. He made some suggestions from the banquet menu but could not confirm whether any of the sauces in the dishes contained gluten-ingredients which was very worrying.

We ended up having to order boiled rice and edamame means as we could not take the risk of having an allergic reaction. I would advise anyone with any dietary issues to avoid this restaurant as nobody seemed to follow through on the claim that they could accommodate dietary requirements.",Korean BBQ,1

THis is a good place for friends to sit down, chill and cook out.
The place is average, decor does not add a feel of being in an Asian food place.
Service is ok, they do help other customers who are new to table top grill experience.
The food is satisfying, especially since it's been a long time since we've had some grilled meat on the table. But I would say I've had better in the past. Also, there were only three side dishes. In authentic Korean restaurants, they provide about 5 or more with unlimited refills.

Nevertheless, if you miss the experience, this place provides some semblance to Korean grills in the UK",Korean BBQ,1
799,Kakibot,Korean BBQ,5.0,A hidden gem!,"This place is hard to discover by chance but if you're lucky enough to walk past it you shouldn't hesitate to come in!

We'll definitely be back.",Korean BBQ,1

801,Drumclog186,Korean BBQ,5.0,Authentic food and great atmosphere,"I visited this new restaurant with my Korean born family for a celebration, after a recommendation. I was so pleased I chose here because everyone was very impressed with the food and the atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing. The interior has a contemporary design feel.
We went for the barbecue at your table option and cooked the meat ourselves which was good fun and made for an inclusive experience as we fought for control of the tongs and argued over who was to be chef.
We had the Sam Gyup Sal ( 3 layered pork) , Doe Ji Bulgogi( marinated pork) , So Bulgogi ( marinated beef), Saeng galbi (beef ribs) and Doenjang jjigae ( traditional stew). It was all excellent, particularly the meat I cooked ㅎㅎ. I would particularly recommend the Sam Gyup Sal which was a really flavoursome piece of meat.

802,VeBeKay,Korean BBQ,3.0,They could do so much better!,"Been there twice since they've opened and, yes, the food is good (I'd give it 4 stars - points off because my kimchi soup was a bit bland..), but it was so frustrating how the dished appeared with LONG delays for different people...
The first time, it was just two of us, and it was relatively busy, so we thought it's not the end of the world that my boy-friend had already finished his meal before mine appeared (also: he hadn't noticed that he had to order rice with his meal and this also wasn't pointed out by the waiter... by the time we noticed this, the waiter was nowhere to be seen, so basically, my bf ate his main course..with some delay also his rice portion.. and then , finally did my course appear).

The same thing happened again the next time we came. We were 4 people then and there was only one other couple in the restaurant, but there was a ~10min lag between everyone's course being brought to the table. Very frustrating! (The fact that the waiter said ""enjoy your meal"" to the first person who got his food and then walked away, kind of implied that he'd better eat before it gets cold, I guess...)

It was generally very hard to get the waiter's attention , he even disappeared to the outside and never looked if we wanted more food/drinks etc.
By the end of the meal, we were sat for 30minutes chatting, but nobody came to actually remove the dirty plates and dishes from us.

I really hope that this place gets its service sorted, because it could be really good if it does...",Korean BBQ,1

We ordered the mix set which comes in 2 portion - spicy and non-spicy. The spiciness of the spicy version is just right and the non-spicy version is marinated in a sweet sauce.

The non-spicy portion turned out to be a little salty but the kids loved it. The spicy portion was great and not too hot for Asian level of hotness. We concluded that the spicy one was better compared to the non-spicy one.

They cooked the meat and rice for you, though you can do some of it yourself. That’s one of the beauties of eating like this, the active participation and freshness of the food you get to eat.

This dish is really tasty! There’s vegetables as well and it is saucy with a spicy, sweet, and savoury flavour. It’s difficult to a solo diner here because the portion is massive and I don’t know if they have “to go”.

890,Hashima D,유가네 닭갈비 명동1호점,5.0,Chicken Galbi Goodness!,"Firstly, the staff was very gracious and accommodating.:) They helped us with the menu because we weren't aware of the level of spiciness.

There was a salad bar where you can get the vegetables and kimchi. :)

The meat is as tender and as well-marinated. The level of spiciness is less than moderate, and it is more sweet than spicy actually. It was complemented by the vegetables and kimchi.
The chicken may be the main dish, but we also tried the seafood which was equally amazing and tasty.

Overall, I enjoyed Yoogane because of it's value for money, great dining experience, and the food of course. We came back regularly during our stay in Korea. :)",['dakgalbi'],요

We headed there a little later in the afternoon to miss the lunch crowd. When we got there, there was no queue and a bunch of tables available. GREAT!!! .

The ladies headed over to the restroom but there was a queue. My dad and myself had a seat and looked through the menu. We decided on what we wanted to eat and my mum got back and started looking through the menu.

Here is when our mood was totally killed. My lady wasn't even back yet, and its been no more than 5 minutes. This guy, whom i assume is the Supervisor, cause he was in a different uniform, came up to our table aggressively and raised his voice saying, 'Order NOW, YOU SIT HERE SO LONG'. I explained, my wife is in the toilet, dont worry once shes out we will order'. He shouts, 'NO ORDER NOW' and flings the menu at my 64 year old dad.

Things have clearly already gone out of hand. I tell my parents to pack and i stood up and told him to back off. I was FUMING. This went way too far. If my parents and lady were not there, this would have gone alot worse.

We stood up and left. I am disgusted by this establishment, and would NEVER recommend stepping foot in this horrendous place. Picture of the 'Supervisor' included.",['dakgalbi'],1

The restaurant that claim themselves as Korea's number One chicken Galbi has been in the business since 1981. A narrow entrance and staircase brought us to the second floor of the shop. We waited around 15-20 min at the staircase as they only have around 15-20 tables and no waiting room.

We ordered Marinated Chicken Galbi Fried Rice and the Marinated Chicken Galbi by itself with the addition of extra noodles, rice and cheese. They are cooked in front of us and everyone was given an apron to prevent any spraying from the cooking. Main ingredients were chicken, cabbage, oil and chili . Chili empowering the whole dish, so for some people, the dish might be too strong and spicy but it is very delicious.
Kimchi and other pickles were self served and they are fresh.

Please note that if you're looking for top service then this may not be the correct place for you. It's an establishment to enjoy the atmosphere of the galbi being cooked in front of you.
We waited for about 10/15 minutes and eventually got seated, table still being half cleaned as we sat down. Had a more older waitress waiting us, she tried her best to explain to us how it worked but communication barrier broke down a bit and not to her fault. We chose the standard chicken galbi and ordered additional rice to go with it.
Everything arrived pretty quick and was soon on the fire cooking, the service staff must rotate in the tables since we didn't really see the original waitress again. You're able to stir the ingredients yourself or the staff will come around periodically doing it. Either way, it can be fun so enjoy it.
Once cooked we were asked if we wanted the rice added in as well. Note, the rice is supposed to be added after you've eaten some of it and not added in straight when the cheese, chicken and veg is cooked. The new waiter that's come to our table asked if we wanted, but didn't advise that it should be done after. Only knowing after it was added, its meant to be cooked with the left overs to soak up the remaining flavours on the palate.

The waiter wasn't friendly (or rude) but we were able to order our food and got what we needed. We went after the lunch rush but there were still a lot of diners and it was busy. Our food came shortly and we chatted while waiting for the chicken to be cooked all the way. I thought the food was just average and wasn't spicy enough but my friend who never had Dakgalbi before loved it. We loved dipping our chicken in cheese and the fried rice they made for us at the end. I'm glad my friend enjoyed her meal but I probably won't visit on my own.",['dakgalbi'],0
945,JessDunbar,유가네 닭갈비 명동1호점,1.0,"Terrible service, walked out before ordering!","Never have I ever placed a 1 star review on Tripadvisor, nor walked out of a resturaunt so confused and angry.

Me and my partner went to this restaurant as our first BBQ experience. Small menu, so we tried to order a BBQ chicken dish for 2 people (23000 won) as well as another chicken rice dish (6000 won) as we were so hungry. Was told we could not order both dishes? We didnt understand why this was, so tried to clarify - and our waiter was so rude, treating us like we were stupid. We continually tried saying we wanted both, and was not given a clear explanation as to why we had to choose one or the other. Why is it that your resturaunt would not allow us to spend the extra money for one extra dish?

Also found it odd the treatment of other customers wanting to come in to the restaurant by the man at the front - not even a smile on his face, very abrupt.

Lack of service standards are clearly reflected in many reviews as we found out after exiting the resturaunt and searching it up online.

We ended up walking out without ordering anything, and found a better resturaunt with MUCH better service.",['dakgalbi'],0
946,udubfl,유가네 닭갈비 명동1호점,4.0,Spicy Chicken BBQ! Yummy,"First off, if you are visiting Korea, chicken BBQ (galbi) is one of the must food you must try! So, there's hundreds of restaurants you can go to. So, I would say Yoogane is pretty popular with tourists and locals. It's a chain but they are consistent and good. It's spicy but you can order non-spicy for children or those who don't want spicy.

Like everyone says, they cook the food in front of you so, it does get smelly (but so does every local BBQ joints in Korea). So, cover your jackets with their aprons they provide or put it in a shopping bag if you have them. This helps reduce the after effects :). They have frebreez-type spray by the exit if you can't live with the smell.

I would say it's almost a three course meal. First, your chicken BBQ. You can add whatever you want to make it more customized to your tasting such as cheese, udon noodles, etc. Second course, you order the fried rice, which they take your leftover chicken BBQ and its sauces and mix white rice and other little ingredients. After you get your filling of rice, then you order your third entree, which is Naeg-Mun (cold water noodle). It's has some sweet and vinegar taste. It's a nice way to refresh after the hot and spicy food.

It's nothing fancy but it's a nice way to get some culture and local food. The hard part is finding this place. It's tucked away with all other shops.",['dakgalbi'],1

The menue had an English translation which made it really easy to understand what we were ordering. The 2 of us got 2x orders of the chicken and octopus Galbi with 2x sides of rice and 1x serve of cheese. Our waitress then proceeded to prepare the food right in front of us in a giant bbq built into our table, by progressively adding the rice and cheese into the bbq.
