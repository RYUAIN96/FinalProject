0,AppleTech,Korea House,5.0,Fun and Authentic Experience with Great Service,We’d never had Korean before and I’d been wanting to try this for a while. We let our server know we’d never had it before and she gave us some recommendations. We ended up going with the beef bulgogi and the dolsot bibimbap. Both were great. It is important to know that some of the food is season to taste - so plan to add some of the table sauce and soy sauce to make it how you like it. The appetizer sides that came with each entree were great too. Service was excellent and everyone was very friendly. Lots of regulars while we were there.,"['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
1,NickyD202,Korea House,5.0,Get the seafood pancake,"I really was unsure of how much of the menu would appeal to me at Korea House but I went with a large group that order several dishes. They were all excellent!

My favorite dish was the seafood pancake but really enjoyed the chicken bulgogi, fried dumplings and fried rice as well.

I definitely recommend Korea House. It's not fancy but it's good food. Also the staff were great dealing with our large group and the food came out fast and hot.

You can bring your own wine for a $5 corkage fee.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
2,RCSColumbus,Korea House,5.0,The Real Deal Korean,"Absolutely delicious authentic Korean food served in a no-frills tiny space in an otherwise drive-by shopping center on Charlotte Pike. Go early (or late) to get a table, or just plan to take-out. The wonderful small trays of side dishes that come with every meal come first and are so good they'll be gone before your food arrives. Ours were. And the bibimbap is worth driving across the state for!","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
3,Btravelfood,Korea House,4.0,Banchan,"The banchan or side dishes that they serve are what I love about this restaurant. There's about 8 different kinds and they're very consistent in terms of quality, preparation, and taste. I also regularly get the doenjang jiggae, usually to-go. The place can get crowded pretty quickly at peak meal times. There aren't too many tables and no waiting area.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
4,cmcwhirter33,Korea House,5.0,Excellent food,My eleven year old twins beg to get biminbop on days off of school. We drive 45 minutes for the best around!,"['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
5,Profcapt,Korea House,5.0,Authentic Delicious Food,"Dont go here for ambiance but if you want Bulgogi, Mandy, Soju....great lunch. The meal comes with rice and about 7 (seven) other side dishes (radish and cabbage kimchi, marinated bean sprouts, tofu, egg dish, sweet radish, etc). Get a cold Soju to split or barley tea. Split an entree because you get such a large serving. Yummy.

It's a good meal, service is fast and pleasant. Plenty of parking. Locals Koreans also eat here. Worth a drive.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
6,Gary G,Korea House,5.0,Authentic,"Quick visit for lunch. First time eating Korean food. This place isn't big or fancy, but it's small and friendly. And the food is excellent. I can recommend the Chicken Bugolgi.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
7,CruiserHoo,Korea House,5.0,New Convert to Korean Food!,"Heard great things about Korea House and decided to take DH here as a surprise dinner for our anniversary. Wow! I'm not a huge Korean food fan but DH loves it. I figured I could find something here, and boy did I! Yum - E! As recommended by others the chicken bulgogi was delicious. Don't skip the fried potstickers - DH said they tasted like the ones in Seoul. He had the bibimbop and said it was delicious. As others mentioned, the place is small with kitchy decor. Service and food quality were 100% and top notch. I'm all in on the Korea House! We'll be back!","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
8,jillnWendell,Korea House,5.0,Love it.,"One of our favorite places. Nothing much in the decor, but service and food are wonderful. I will say that I’ve eaten there more than 10 times and only have gotten the chicken lettuce wraps. They’re so good, that I can’t bring myself to order anything else! Pretty small place. We only go on “off times”.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
9,LiketoeatCincinnati,Korea House,4.0,Authentic Korean Food,"This is a small but very good place specializing in authentic Korean food, and not fusion. They offer numerous delicious hot soups, as well as awesome hot pork and other meats. The place is very good.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
10,Kcjmiddle,Korea House,4.0,Korea House,"Korea House is a tiny, strip mall restaurant close to Sylvan Park. We went for dinner on a Thursday and were able to sit down immediately. I noticed that some folks were getting to-go orders, so that is an option as well. The service was good and the food explained to us when we asked. I have zero experience with Korean food, but I found everything tasty. The side dishes are fun. Prices are moderate and parking plentiful. This is a very casual place. They do take credit cards.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
11,524512,Korea House,4.0,A Festival Of Flavors!,"Today I went to Korea House. I was assigned to South Korea from 1991-1993 and I developed a love of Korean food. I had bulgogi and several small side dishes like kimchi, pickled radishes, pickled bean sprouts, etc. The dishes were all delicious and the service exceptional. If you have an affinity for korean food, I recommend Korea House.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
12,KendallTellsAll,Korea House,5.0,Worth the Wait,"I ordered the Chicken Bulgogi and the flavors were phenomenal. I got it with regular heat which is spicy but tolerable to finish the meal. The vegetables were mixed and sautéed well. Portions were very appropriate for someone with a large appetite. Rice was sticky and moist without being mushy. There was a bit of wait as it was very crowded; but, I would say it's worth the wait. They make up in quality what they are lacking in ambience and decor. The staff was nice and quick.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
13,badgercadger,Korea House,5.0,Fantastic!,"My first experience with Korean food--I was skeptical that I'd like it, but I absolutely loved everything on the table! Tiny little place that stays busy. Very reasonable prices, and the food is deeeelicious. Friendly staff, authentic food and atmosphere. Love this place.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

15,bdcdaddy,Korea House,4.0,Pork Bulgogi for lunch,"Our first time here. Made me wonder if I’d ever had a Korean dish like this before. It is a simple restaurant. I told the waitress I wanted something with pork and she told me to get the bulgogi. My wife had the beef version.

Many cold side ms served with it along with lettuce to, we assumed, use for eating similar to a lettuce wrap except these were longer skinny romaine leaves (I think).

Food was very tasty.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",0
16,ScuttledCuttle,Korea House,5.0,Best Korean hands down.,"I need to be more adventurous here and get more than bibimbap or Korean BBQ, but both of those things are so, so good here that I rarely stray. Generous portions, full of vegetables, nice touches like freshly fried eggs on top, and those steaming clay bowls are awesome. They bring out a lot of sides (""banchan"") to the table for everyone to share, good variety of dishes like kimchi, bean sprouts, potatoes, etc. Staff is always welcoming and friendly. All those awards are well earned.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
17,AndrewCern,Korea House,5.0,Seobiseu,"Hands down, the most authentic Korean experience I've had back in the states, the food is delicious, and prepared by what appears to be a family. Make sure to eat your fill while you're there because Korean food has the tendency to make itself known in the fridge. I've seen some complaints about service, but they operate just like restaurants in Korea do, you've got to tell them you want something, and it'll be on the table in no time flat. The only downside is that I didn't have the stomach to eat everything on the menu, they basically have all of the classics that you could possibly want. If I lived closer, this would be a weekly spot.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
18,YankeeElitist,Korea House,5.0,Tasty and Legit Korean Chow!,"My wife and I both enjoy Korean food very much but it is very difficult to find in many cities in the South. This restaurant was rated as the best Korean food in the Nashville area so we tried it. I had the KimChee soup with beef and Mary had Bulgogi. We were served the traditional little side dishes with our meal and these are always my way of separating the good from the very best. The kim chee itself was on the rather tame side. I did not request the really dilish hot stuff and am sorry I did not. However, it was very good and the soup was outstanding to the last drop and it was served in a huge bowl which I lifted and drained just like I used to do in Korea! The bulgogi was also very good. The service was friendly and helpful and relatively fast and the prices were reasonable. If you want to try Korean food, this is a very good place to do it with good food and a large selection to choose from. I cannot remember the name of the red ""paste"" they always bring in a side dish which looks like ketchup but I can say that it is what stole the show for me here! I dipped everything I could in it and it was SCRUMPTIOUS!","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
19,OTAN,Korea House,4.0,Tasty and uncomplicated...welcoming staff.,"Four folk for dinner...staff explained all dishes, even going into detail for the newcomers next to us who'd not had Korean food.
Tasty dishes, ample sized portions. Simple, unadorned storefront...no ambience at all save good food. Noisy when crowded. Expect to speak loudly and be heard by others at close-in tables.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
20,simchah3,Korea House,5.0,Great Korean food in Tennessee,This restaurant has delicious Korean food. We recommend the bibimbap and the galbi. They make their own kimchi and it is very tasty. Their service is quick and friendly. The restaurant is busy at lunch on the weekend.,"['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
21,C8440PVjohnh,Korea House,5.0,First time there,Very small restaurant in a strip mall. Most authentic Korean food Ive hade in a long time. Their service is great. BUT the food is excellent,"['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
22,wchardin12,Korea House,4.0,A small place with a lot of flavor!,"Decided to have my last lunch of 2016 at Korea House. I know there's a Chinese New Year, but is there. Korean new year? The iPhone didn't capitalize Korean new year, but did for Chinese New Year, so I guess not. Anyway, back to Korea House. Located in a strip mall along Charlotte Pike, it's a rather small and unassuming restaurant. We had a party of six and were at immediately, but we also arrived at open. I can see where this place would fill up rather quickly because of the small size.

As my first time here, and I think my first time at a Korean place, I skimmed the pictures on here and got a couple tips from some friends who'd ate here before. I went with the chicken bulgogi ($14.99). I wasn't sure what it was, but the bulgogi seemed like the popular thing on the menu. It came with a bunch of different sides. We had a table of 6, and they brought out two ordered of sides for the table. The portion for the chicken bulgogi was large, it also came with a container of steamed, white rice. I mixed some of the rice in with the main dish and put a little of the sauce from the bottle onto my plate. It was a little spicy, but not insanely spicy. I enjoyed it and would probably get it again if I went back.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
23,283shirleyw,Korea House,5.0,Best Korean in Nashville,The beef japchae and bulgogi are to die for! And their bibimbap is toasty and filling. Great place for lunch and dinner.

25,Chris R,Korea House,5.0,Another hidden gem in Nashville,This Nashville restaurant is nestled in a little strip center on the West side. There are about 12 tables and you may have to wait a bit if you show up during prime time. But it will be well worth the wait! The service is great and the food is spectacular. Very flavorful. Great sized portions. The staff is very good at suggesting something if you aren't quite sure what to get. The prices are fair. Food is great. No excuse not to go there!,"['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
26,TravelingTnHillbilly,Korea House,5.0,Seeking Diversity,"The food was amazing; however, the restaurant has won ""best of"" eleven years running.

29,Ler8804,Korea House,5.0,Love these folks!,"This is a fantastic hole-in-the-wall that is always full to the brim of people who don't speak English. You know a restaurant is great when it seems to be a gathering place for the local community of wherever they happen to be from!

32,329bbww,Korea House,4.0,Good Family Restaurant,"In today's world of cookie-cutter chain restaurants and the-thing-of-the-moment-menu items, it is so rewarding to find a family owned restaurant presenting the ethnic food of their home country. And they present it well and at a tremendous value.
Four of us began with the wonderful seafood pancake accompanied with a sauce the waiter explained to us simply as ""pancake sauce"". Just wonderful. Then we ordered an entree of beef, of shrimp, of pork and the kimchee rice.
We all had to laugh when we received our food. With the companion dishes that come with any entree order, we had covered every inch of our table with various dishes and sauces. I won't list everything we ordered (previous reviewers have listed their own favorites) but it was all good, and some great (especially the seafood pancake).
And we finished every morsel.
No reservations so come early or you will wait for a table.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",0

34,lefaystorm,Korea House,5.0,Korea House!!,"The food is excellent and the staff super friendly. The restaurant looked very clean with good light and seating. The price is reasonable and the food memorable. I live about an hour and a half away and have traveled to Nashville just to eat here before. They give you a very large portion along with the sides everyone at my table always leaves with a doggie bag, or a doggie cup if they got soup. :) The only downside is the restaurant is very small and everyone loves the place so if you come during the lunch or dinner rush be prepared to wait in line.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
35,V3763LOpauls,Korea House,4.0,Great authentic korean food,"I would give Korea House a 4.5. It can't get a 5 simply because of the atmosphere. It is totally a dive. That said, the food is excellent. The dolsot bibimbap is excellent. The bulgogi is also very good. The service is average. The value is great. I would have no problem giving them a 5 if the atmosphere was a little nicer and the service a little better. That said, I would recommend this place to anyone.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

40,radioriffraff,Korea House,5.0,Unexpected Delight!,"Those of us in the Nashville advertising community are a fairly tight knit bunch. Joe and I made a date for lunch and he suggested Korea House on Charlotte. ""Sure thing"" was my reply. When I arrived on the scene Joe was seated and I told him as I sat down that it was my first time, not only at Korea House, but also to try Korean food. His immediate response was that he assumed I'd been there with his cousin, Judy, also an advertising vet and dear buddy of mine. The place was shabby chic. Populated by diners who were largely seemingly Korean. A Korean TV station was on the screens. Followed Joe's lead and ordered the #16. Dolsot Bibimbap - rice topped with vegetables and beef bits and a fried egg in a hot stone pot. When our dishes arrived on he table they were literally sizzling. The waitress with a beautiful smile had brought us small dishes of assorted additions to mix into our stone pots. We mixed and blended. The results were a delicious cacophony of flavors. Have to confess, upon entry I was a bit worried. Glad I followed Joe's lead with #16. Just really great! Going back for sure. Thanks, Joe for introducing me to Korea House! Totally enjoyed! A new Nashville favorite!","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

Server Jennifer was understanding about our cluelessness re Korean food and kindly made a suggestion to help firm my choice and several others made the same decision. Yummy beef, veggies, rice served in a hot iron pot topped w/egg.

44,Two2007Foodies,Korea House,4.0,Don't pass by this hole-in-the-wall,"You may not give this restaurant a second look if driving down Charlotte but it’s definitely worth the stop. The food was delicious and hot (both temperature and spice) and you get a lot of it. Some lunch items were served in a steaming stone pot that kept the food cooking throughout the entire meal. The menu is authentic Korean cuisine with nearly 100 options to choose from. However, it’s not somewhere to go if you are looking for a quick business lunch. Lunch lasted about 90 minutes. It’s also not good for large groups (go with a group of 4 or less).","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",0

46,Christa P,Korea House,4.0,Good Korean Food,"We have been to Korea House a few times. The food is consistently good and is pretty cheap overall. I order the bimbimbap with beef, which comes with all the classic Korean side accompaniments. It comes out served in a hot stone or clay pot so that the bottom of the rice gets extremely crispy- which makes it absolutely delicious. Another staple we normally get is the beef ribs - they come with scallions and a wonderful sauce on a hot plate. I absolutely love their house made hot sauce - it is like a Korean style Sirachai- sooo good. The only things we haven't been huge fans of were the seafood pancake and the tripe soup. The seafood pancake was almost inedible because it was so fishy tasting. Even with having a few dishes we would never order again, the food is consistently pretty good. Service is ok- its not fine dining or even like a regular restaurant. The set up is a little cramped style but is normally full because its probably the best Korean in Nashville.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
47,Byron W,Korea House,5.0,Birthday Meal,"As out-of-towners, we asked my bro where he'd like to dine for his birthday. We ended up at Korea House. Initial impressions were not great, little strip mall, tiny crowded room. Folks standing in line outside should have been our first clue. The service was slow, but the food was oh-so-wonderful. Like beef bulgogi? Bibimbap? Eight sides to share? Fresh ingredients served hot, authentic flavors. Dynamite experience and would like to sample other menu items soon.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",0
48,photoclark,Korea House,4.0,"Small, Crowded, Awesome","Korea House is not about appearances. It's a simple square dining room about 20x30 feet in diameter. Tables sit as close together as possible and you can sit side by side in the center section. I love it. Authentic cuisine and native language customers make this diner a fun, wonderful place. The smells emitting from the kitchen are full of spice and flavor before you even taste it.
All the dishes I see make my mouth water. I'm having the fried dumplings and the Galbi, pork short ribs. I'm writing this as I wait. Any time I get around good food I get excited. There is nothing better than being able to enjoy wonderful cuisine in a relaxing speed. Food does not need to be hurried and this one is not.
Fried dumplings are perfect. Small enough to be bite size, crispy and flavorful.
Conversation and someone to share with might make it better, but my love affair with the food here kinda puts that on the back burner.
Main meal arrived. Eight sides and a big platter of meat. It's hard to start. The kimchi varieties, tofu, potatoes, ribs, just so good.
It has taken me a few, but I'm back to finish this up. Sides are never ending, always a bonus when they are good.
I feel like this is an anticlimactic end, but I am very satisfied. This is definitely a bring someone back place.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
49,benchristinastone,Korea House,4.0,Great food,"The food is excellent. Highly recommend the Dolsot Bibimbop. Prices are a little steep $11-$30. Service isn't the greatest. It was our first time at a Korean restaurant so when we would try to ask questions they were short with us or would just walk away. When the woman brought the sides out we asked what they were and the woman as she was walking away said ""sides"". We knew that, we wanted to know what each one was. So when she walked back by I stopped her and asked what was in each one and she just did not want to tell us. I finally just asked if any had fish since I don't like fish and was told one did. But I would still go back because the food is that good!","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
50,Mandy W,Korea House,5.0,"Amazing bulgogi, excellent service!","My husband and I love Korean food so we are always on the lookout for a good, authentic Korean restaurant. Because we travel to Nashville several times a year we asked around and were directed to Korea House. The first thing I noticed when walking into the small restaurant was the amount of Korean people having dinner. Good sign if you are looking for authentic Korean food! Second thing I noticed was how well worn everything was (in a nice homey way), another good sign to me. We ordered bulgogi (one chicken, one beef) and dolsot bibimbap. The food is amazingly good, so flavorful and spicy! The sides were great, I especially love the kimchi and the bean sprouts. Our server mixed the bibimbap for us and it was perfect. We will continue to frequent Korea House whenever we are in Nashville as the food is great. ***On a side note, the first time we visited the server we had (a young woman) was not very nice, she was almost hostile for some reason. We ordered three meals so we could share a little of each and take the rest back with us to eat over the next couple of days (unless my teen son gets hungry...then it is one meal). She had the nerve to look at us and say ""That's a lot of food..."" and just stood there. So what? We were paying for it so why the concern? The second time our server was an older woman and she was awesome! Couldn't have asked for a better sever. She sealed the deal for us as we had planned to look elsewhere if the service had been as poor as it had been the first time. She brought us boxes for our leftover food and didn't bat an eye when we ordered three meals :)","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

But I live 90 miles away and this is the 2nd time in a row I've been turned away! I called ahead since I was running behind and they said be there by 9:30 and it would be okay. I arrived at 9:20 and the owner still turned me away. The previous time I waited in line til 9:30 but was turned away even though I arrived at 9:00. I will NOT be back again. From now on I will go to hai woon dai where the food is just slightly less quality than that at Korea house IMO. But the hospitality at hai woon dai is worlds better.

52,dereks578,Korea House,5.0,Authentic!,"We used to live in Los Angeles, frequenting local Korean restaurants for some of the most delicious food on earth. After escaping to Tennessee, we realized how much we missed that authentic Korean flavor. It had been years since bulgogi or bibimbap had delighted my languishing tastebuds.... that is, until the day a friend mentioned ""Korea House.""

It was exactly what we needed! Yes, it's a cramped, but the food was great and at the right price. We'll be visiting again very soon.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
53,Jason P,Korea House,1.0,Don't pay with CC and split bill.,"Went here with a friend. My tab was $18 hers was $29.

So, we split the tab and he has me rung up as $18. And then when I hand him my card he quickly adds to it to make it $29 and then changes my friend's to $18, so quickly you wouldn't even know it, without saying a word.

These people are rude, if not criminal.

I let it go as a 'mistake' but it's grown on me I felt the need to put in a negative review it's upset me so much.

It's old Korean man who works there at the register. I should have refused but it's only $10 but the more I think about it the more angry I become because he did it so purposely and so blatantly and then, of course, doesn't understand english.

I do not recommend, this was practically criminal. The food was okay, the younger woman is nice. There's some old lady, probably the man's wife, who came up without saying a word and just flung the food down on the table.

55,ronlandau,Korea House,4.0,Definitely Worth a Try,"Three of us had lunch and even though we only ordered two main courses we had way too much food. We started with fried pork dumplings and a seafood pancake which were very good. The seafood pancake was closer to a pizza than a pancake because it had so much seafood in it. It was better after the waitress suggested putting soy sause on it.
We forgot that they put out complimentary appetizers and that is why we had too much food. There were about six small plates with different things. Really liked the potato, the fish and stayed away from the kimchi. Its too hot for us.
My daugter ordered a beef dish and I ordered the chicken fried rice. I did't try hers but she liked it and I liked my dish. I definitely would recommend giving this restaurant a try.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

66,EmmyJean615,Korea House,5.0,Love the food and the owners...,"You guys seriously... Korean is one of my all time favorite types of food to eat. A bulgogi bi bim bop is home cooking to me (and I am not by any stretch of the imagination Korean). I've had bad Korean food, and am not universally accepting of the genre. This is not bad Korean food. This is seriously delicious Korean food. The ban chan are like little gems set in front of you to sample and enhance your meal, and they make their own kimchi too. It's perfect on the hot-sour meter as far as I'm concerned. The only thing this place does not have (which I wouldn't expect them to) that I miss are soju cocktails. If you've had soju cocktails with the easy pour spout and the deceptively tiny glasses, you know what I mean. Otherwise love these welcoming, happy people and the food they make!!!","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1
67,anonymousfortwayne,Korea House,5.0,Really delicious,"A hidden gem in Nashville and a place for authentic Korean food. We were visiting for the week and found this place on Yelp. Bulgogi was tender and juicy beef barbecue cooked with onions and scallions and eaten with white rice. The bibimbop is a dish with pickled carrots, radishes, lettuce, barbecue beef, egg, mushrooms, bean sprouts, and a hot and sweet sauce. It was beautiful and delicious. The seafood pancake (pajon) was really good--- thick, aromatic, crispy, with a tangy sauce, and small pieces of shrimp and squid in the pancake. The soondubujige, a seafood stew, was gobbled up by the family. All the dishes are served with small side dishes including kimchee, bean sprouts, tempura, omelettes, radishes, and cucumbers. Definitely recommend this place.","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

We lived for two years in Korea and the food at Korea House is better than we got there. We always get the fried dumplins. Wonderful and gone in a flash! Then we order the Bulgoggi. It comes with lots of little side dishes. You put the meat on a lettuce leaf, add the red sauce, some steamed rice, and shredded radish. YUM! This is the national dish of Korean and it is GREAT! Then we also get Kimchee fried rice - spicy and tasty. And Chop Cha. This is a noodle dish that has meat and veggies. It is lots of food, but you will want to taste it all and if there is any left take it home for later. Everyone that we have taken here loves it! It is in a strip mall. But you are NOT going for the atmosphere - you are going for the food. We drive 45 minutes to get there!","['kimchijjigae', 'samgyeopsal']",1

80,kacee692019,I Love Korea,3.0,Disappointed - Portion size and to go orders,"While the food is good to the taste, the serving sizes are comical. They are VERY stingy with serving size. Also, if I dine in for lunch and get the lunch plate you get 3 sides BUT if get a lunch plate to go, you ONLY get 2 sides and again the portion size is not enough to have for the entire meal. Sides should be the same REGARDLESS to whether I dine in or take out! Also, yesterday (14 MAR 19) I ordered a plate to go and asked how much for a side of reddish and the size (because the last time I got the little plastic condiment size container for my sides, so I wanted to know if I paid for extra what size would it be. I was told the ounce size...IT WAS NO. Waiter tried to compensate by saying he FILLED the container to full for me - well DUH. Why should it not be full? Especially as small as it was - not my ounce for the price! I fully intend to speak to management my next visit. Times are too hard for us to pay for such small portions. We expect and demand better from American style establishments and ALL should be held to the same standard. UNACCEPTABLE.

I Love Korea needs to revamp their portion sizes and to go orders.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae']",1

83,JerryH136,I Love Korea,2.0,I DID NOT Love Korea,"I was out for lunch and decided I wanted sushi. I thought about places nearby that served sushi and decided on I Love Korea. I had not been there recently so I was unaware if any changes had been made. As I entered the parking lot I noticed that the main business sign still prominently displayed "" Sushi Bar "". I went in and was immediately seated as there were not many customers. I was given a menu and no sushi was on it. I asked a server and was told they did not do sushi anymore. As it was lunch I did not have time to go elsewhere so I ordered a spicy chicken box. The chicken was passable but I've had much better at other Korean or Vietnamese restaurants in town. The accompanying dishes were for the most part not very good. No sauce was served with the stuffed dumpling as you usually see. Service was okay but nothing was making up for the false advertising and mediocre food. You can get much better Korean at a better lunch price at several places in Huntsville. As I left I took another look at the sign to make sure I wasn't crazy. Nope, it still said "" Sushi Bar ""","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae']",0

But bulgogi was ""leftover from lunch""?
The meat was precooked, too salty and tasted like chucks of something burnt.
Rice was good. Miso soup was good. Fried pot stickers were good.
Pan-chan - kimchi was good. Thinly sliced vinegar radish were good. Other stuff were not.
Maybe depends on what you order here, and it was my first time here, but will not give it another chance. Disappointed with the meat.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae']",0
90,redlocs_99,I Love Korea,4.0,First timer,"So a co-worker invited me to lunch for my birthday. I went online, saw great reviews and the menu and decided I'd try the bimbimbap. the waiter however suggested that as a first timer I might want to try the lunch box. though both are crowd pleasers, I went with his suggestion and wasn't unhappy.
I got the bugogli (beef) lunch box. my co-worker got the chicken wing box, with a side of beef.

Unsure why my co-worker could get the chicken wing box with a side of beef, when I couldn't get the beef box, with a side of chicken... was the same food. but, what I got was really tasty and flavorful.
the beef could've been a bit more hot - semi-luke warm, but still not bad.

we got there when they opened at 11, and within 20minutes the place was nearly packed.

This week i am at home again visiting and i noticed this new korean restaurant...I Love Korea. It is right across the street from the original Korea House. I had the chicken bibimbop in the stone pot and it was excellent. It came out sizzling hot from the kitchen and the miso soup is some of the best i've had. The side dishes were three kinds of kimche, fishcakes and noodles but were tiny portions which could have been a bit larger i feel. My mother had the chicken terriyaki and that was awesome too.

Unlike at home, ( Clarksville TN) they only gave 6 side dishes , which isn't so bad but the portions we VERY small. Then they didn't seem to want to give refills on the sides, we had to ask. The Gal bi was too salty and not as tender as we are use to.

The Champong was a bit too oily but had a pretty good flavor.

The spicy pork ( California Rolls ) were very good. The server was nice except for the fact that he didn't come to check on us for refills of sides.

99,leandrap256,I Love Korea,4.0,Great Korean Lunch,"After looking at their menu and hearing from others how great this place is, my husband and I decided to try it for lunch. When we walked in we were greeted immediately and seated in the ""party section"" in the back. They were very busy so this didn't bother us at all; we were just happy to get a seat that fast. We looked at the menu and our waiter was taking our order in less than 2 minutes. I ordered the Bulgogi Lunch Box and my husband ordered the rice dish with Bulgogi and a fried egg on top (I don't remember exactly what it was called). We received our miso soup and then our little side dishes of kimchi, radish, etc. very quickly. The food was great. The soup was served hot, with the little tofu pieces, and the side dishes were exactly what we expected. When I received my lunch box I was impressed because it looked and smelled amazing. My husband received his food about 3-4 minutes later. Because we didn't receive our food at the same time, we never got a check to go pay (we had to relay what we ordered to the cashier at the front), and also because the women next to us ordered some soup that smelled so bad (like hot blue cheese) that it was VERY hard to continue to eat our lunch without getting sick; I've decided to give them 4 stars instead of 5.

I Love Korea has very good sushi, but the made to order meals are not as good to me as the buffet at Korea House at the times I visited in 2013. The sushi is a good value, but the lunch menu is a bit pricey for me, especially if I order a side of sushi. If I recall correctly lunch with a side order of sushi was around $16, and that is with a water, tip not included.

I have been back and just had the sushi a couple of times and it is always sooo gooood and fresh.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae']",1

119,SunnyFLovr,I Love Korea,4.0,Diamond in the rough,"I am always looking for good sushi. I found this one by word of mouth and must say they know sushi.
The building used to be a Japanese Restaurant. The outside although a bit rough opens up to a nice interior where you feel welcome. There is a sushi bar at the 'front' and we opted for that as I was a guest of another Korean friend. The selections were traditional but the presentation was spot on! Portions seemed larger than your typical restaurant and the chef was desirous to show us his work - we had about 11 varieties, each was well done. I left full. There is a mizo soup to start you off while you wait, but the wait was not long at all. Staff was helpful and attentive.
I did not get to sample their other meal options, but will be back to do so. I can only give 4 stars till I try the rest. Dinner time is great time to go, as there were open seats, but over half full on the night we visited.","['bulgogi', 'doenjangjjigae']",1

Common allergens (ie eggs, nuts) are specified on menu, which gimchi chigae has but not for the side dishes. I couldn’t change the dish. If this had been told to me prior, I would ask first whether I could change. If not, I’d order something else. I ended paying for something I couldn’t eat.
Also, I ended up with gimbap without tuna despite ordering tuna gimbap on my first takeaway with the restaurant. Money wasted there.

The place itself is nice enough, some Korean and Korean-themed decorations, and the general atmosphere is calm and reserved; pleasant for a peaceful and relaxing dinner.

The food is amazing! It seems to be authentic, and some dishes are very spicy (hot, but delicately seasoned). The menu ranges from classic bibimbap and udon noodles, to various gimgap and sweet potato noodles.

The setting is very pleasing and the decor is retaining the Korean motives in clean modern lines. We didn’t know what to expect with respect to the food when we entered in. And we can not certify if is authentic Korean food. What we can say that it tasted very good. The service was also nice, no personal touch but fast and professional.

I ordered the Bulgogi Bibimbap (Number 2 on the menu) and my boyfriend ordered the Jeyuk-bokeum-bap (Number 8). Both dishes were served with a side of kimchi and my Bulgogi Bibimbap also came with a clear soup. Both dishes were extremely tasty and my boyfriend even joked about asking for the recipe as it was that good and he wanted us to make it back at home.

They accept Visa and they do carry out. I took our food to go and while I had to wait about 15 minutes for our food I imagine that had I called in my order it would have been ready when I got there.

In a city not known for strong customer service they accommodated my requests for sauce on the side for one dish and less spicy on my daughter’s.

What I liked:

1) the food is just so good and reasonably priced. You get authentic Korean food (I was told by friends who lived in Korea), it's well-prepared and presented.
2) The service is very good. I was impressed with the waitresses, they are kind, respectful & speak English, three characteristics that are hard to find in Prague (sorry to say that, they don't have customer service skills here). I was personally served by a blonde one (I'm sorry, I don't know her name). Despite I ordered something but I meant something else, she immediately went to the kitchen and got me what I wanted, literally in 5 minutes. Thank you so much!
3) Restaurant is nice, good atmosphere, clean.
4) Owners are really nice. I had the chance to have a chat with the owner, a Korean woman who is really nice.

The restaurant is a little out of the way, but worth the way. It is just off of the street you get off the tram, and down some steps. Inside is nothing special, but the service is great and friendly and it was reasonably quiet the night we went.
We hadn't eaten Korean before, so didn't know what to expect - we tried Korean ginger tea which was delicious, and then my partner had the tradition soup to start followed by a tray of pork and rice etc. It looked amazing. I had a Ramen type bowl, and some sushi which were both great and plentiful. The price is amazing, and the food is a of a high standard. Thoroughly enjoyed it!",['bibimbap'],1

Although they increased prices recently, it's still good value for money.

I recommend to book a table a day in advance. In the evenings it's almost impossible to find a free table prior booking.

218,Nik H,비빔밥코리아 프라하,3.0,Nice authentic food@terrible service,"I/we have visited the place twice in the past month. One was a quick lunch (the place does not offer any special lunch menu) and the other was what was to be a decent birthday celebration. Food is great in terms of its variety, authenticity, and freshness. Other reviews testify to this, show you pics etc so no need to delve in detail on this. The service is, however, problematic. The lunch experience was below average, service-wise, in terms of attentiveness etc but since the place was pretty empty, it was bearable. However, the birthday celebration on Friday night occassion with a place having being completely packed revealed and amplified this general problem. The staff was very nervous as a line of guests waited inside and outside the restaurant demanding to be seated. Afyer being seated, I had to leave the table three times - first to ask for the menu card (after 20 minutes waiting and not seeing anyone to come and say even hello), second to ask where our soup was after another 30 mins of nothing happening after i brought a waiter with me to the table, and, third, the same with our main course somehow not making it to our table, again, after 30mins, with soup balls still on table!!! Next tables were not served any better but the international crowd of youngsters seemed to be patient if dissatisfied too. Additionally, the right side of the restaurant was very cold and we kept our winter jacket on at times. BOTTOM LINE: I Will give it a third chance as we live nearby but if the service is not substantially improved i will go elsewhere then. There is another jap-korean restaurant nearby (wont identify not to be blamed for favouring it) which, albeit more expensive, provides top service.",['bibimbap'],0

221,Daehyeon K,비빔밥코리아 프라하,5.0,Best restaurant in Praha for me,"Bibimbap Korea is valuable Korean restaurant in Europe. It serves original Korean food and it is really amazing that I can eat real Korean food here. It is definitely different from other Korean restaurant in other European countries. I study in Netherlands and I tried many already in other already but they are frequently poor. However, this place use fresh ingredients and think much about the food.

Some of food was much better than Korea!! If you are beginner of Korean food, try Kimchi Bok-eum-bap or Bibimbap or Dosirak menu. I think Cham-ppong is one of the best dish here but it will be too spicy for beginner. Anyway I think most of the dishes here deserves the price.

You can see many foreigners and local people who is eating Korean food. When I visited here, more than 90% were non-Korean and 70% were non-Asian. If you have enough budget, try this restaurant. You won't regret! Oh! and the servers can speak not only English but also Korean quite well. You can see servers are talking with Korean owner in Korean language.

They haven't got cloths hanger, that's little bit uncomfortable.

We took Ramen and Bibimbap (a) with set of suchi

Ramen was big and very very hot, noodles in it were very simple and without any special taste (looked like the cheapest fast food noodles), BUT it was spicy, thanks for that!

Bibimbap wasn't tasty at all....we both didn't like it.

233,Scott P,비빔밥코리아 프라하,4.0,Unexpectedly good Korean food 👌🏻,"Having lived in Korea for over two years, and being with a Korean, we were excited (but a bit skeptical) to find some Korean food next to our place. We went for lunch and ordered Bibimbap, Pajeon, and bulgogi kimbap. The restaurant's signature dish was delicious - on par with what you'd find in Korea! Flavorful, authentic, and chocked-full of various fresh veggies. We also appreciated that it wasn't served too hot. Our pajeon was solid; nice and crispy on the outside and soft inside with delicious bits of green onion and squid. The kimbap, a staple of my diet when I lived in Seoul, was a bit of a letdown. A tad bland and dry, you can see why they didn't name the place ""Kimbap."" The meal wasn't cheap, but not prohibitively expensive either, though I'm used to paying less for similar dishes. The biggest negative of the meal was the lack of side dishes, as well as bland kimchi that seemed 'washed' in attempt to downplay its natural spiciness for the European market.

I'd definitely recommend, but stick to the bibimbap!",['bibimbap'],1

242,L6G,비빔밥코리아 프라하,4.0,Great Korean food - star down for MSG,"I visited this restaurant with my dad (both of us having on different occasions visited Korea and loved the food) and we were not disappointed. The food was great and authentic. The atmosphere is ok and the gentleman who served us (the owner, their waitress was off at the time) was lovely and helpful. The menu is limited but that's no fault - it means that what you get is really fresh and delicious. Based on this, I'd rate it five star.

However, just as most (if not all...) Korean (or perhaps asian in general) restaurants in Prague, the food contains MSG - and possibly quite considerable amounts. If I had any suspicions, they were confirmed by the sight of the familiar long crystals in the chilli powder mix that I was offered when asked for extra chillies. I was disappointed by this and not surprised - MSG really is very common in countries like Korea and it is almost impossible to get away from there so it's understandable you'd find it here.

My guess is you'd struggle to find Korean restaurant in Prague that avoids MSG and this one is probably as good as it gets :)

One recommendation to the restaurant - get some fresh chillies or Korean chilli sauces to offer those customers who want the real spicy deal",['bibimbap'],1

This restaurant was busy and booked full with reservations. After having dined here, I understand why. The food is amazingly delicious, service is prompt and attentive, the staff there are polite and welcoming. The food was served quickly and it was savored by all of us in our group. Wonderfully seasoned, all the foods were the perfect temperature and plenty of drinks to go around.

The host was friendly and checked in on us during dinner a couple of times to be sure we had everything we needed. Wonderful service!

The Service was not very fast but the owner is a very gentle man.

for dinner, the restaurant gets croweded easily, (probably because it is the best in town) but it is well worth the wait.
They would rather make you wait rather than make you sit next to strangers, so for me, it is a plus.

Maybe reading all the excited reviews raised my expectations too high, but what I found in Bibimbap was a nice and rather busy low key and cosy restaurant with friendly staff and almost 'home-like' atmosphere, but the choice of dishes was rather limited and food was a bit bland.

The restaurant was not the easiest to find as it is a 5 min walk from zizkov tower, hidden after a staircase and not so easy to spot; we luckily used this map and eventually found it. We ordered plum tea, lemon tea, common bibimbap and gimbap. The flavor were new to us but very fresh and tasty, plus presentation was very good as you could see they put passion in their dishes. Service was also attentive and staff was helpful. I was also served fermented kimchi to taste but that was too extreme to me and i did not like it, but every othet dish was amazing. Totally recommend!",['bibimbap'],1

Portions are big enough and we even left food on our plates which we rarely do. Great value for money. The only thing I felt really bad about was that I left the wrong tips which was almost nothing. Other than that I would revisit definitely.,['bibimbap'],0

We chose this place after seeing other reviews on Tripadvisor and also since Korean food is not usually easily available in Europe. We were not disappointed! Since we don't eat meat we asked the waitress to make a vegetarian Bibimbap with eggs and veggies and use Tofu instead of Beef. She gladly took our order. Also our order came with some kind of 'soup' which was also nice and the Kimchi was just like I was expecting!

284,Petrghe,비빔밥코리아 프라하,5.0,Temple of taste!❤️,"We spent last 18 months traveling around. We were always looking for Korean bistro to fulfill our desire for our favourite Bibimbap. This actually never happened, because the best and only real Bibimbap for us is the one that Mr. & Mrs. Lee are serving in their restaurant. There is no better Korean restaurant in English and Spanish speaking world! Their recipes for Kimchi and Tuna soup are just perfect. Soup is so strong and tasty, it is a cure for any weakness.

We went there yesterday after all those months. New place in Zizkov looks beautiful, servers are super friendly and happy as always and the food? The food was maybe even better then I remember!

My favourite combo is:

Bibimbap - in non-heated bowl (Mr. Lee's classic. It is not Korean traditional but the rice stays soft all the time and not ower dry from warmth of the bowl). Soup and kimchi comes with the meal. Total price of CZK150,- is cheap for what you get! And really good price point so everyone can afford this experience.

&

Tuna sushi - to share✌️ CZK130,- for 14pcs maxi roll!

Yummy!

I just love this place. Must-visit in Prague for sure!",['bibimbap'],1

What I love is that their bibimbap comes with such good and plentiful veggies that it's more or less a healthy dinner (in my possibly not especially objective opinion). The owner is super sweet and talkative and is clearly very proud of his little establishment.,['bibimbap'],1

302,Klára K,비빔밥코리아 프라하,5.0,Spicy food whole meny through /with few exceptions/,"I went here with my friend. It was difficult to find a food that is not spicy. My kimči-pokum-bap was basically rice with red curry paste and fried bits of carrot and yammi egg on the top. It was really cold cleaning spicy food and I enjoyed it a lot. Yellow tea - I took it without honey/sugar and it was not my favourite kind of tea. It tastes as burnt rice. It wasn't my favourite taste. But I drank it and felt good afterwards. It was a lovely experience to taste the spicy food with refreshing, rather sour salad.

The price was great for the food we got. Our budget was to stay under 200 CZK for one meal and one drink per person. And we did manage without problems.

The atmosphere was simple, it's not a place where I would go for interior design but food was my goal this time and it exceeded expectations. The serves was really friendly and explained all tastes and combinations. I really appreciated it. I will come back again.",['bibimbap'],1

For a plate of vegetable dumplings, fried squid that was thin and covered in panko and oily and a plain plate of beef short rib (£15!!!!!) bulgogi without rice or anything, we paid £33 - what the actual help?! The portions were tiny too. We were given tap water in a re-usable pink plastic water bottle you use to take water on your bicycle and then at the end of the meal, 2 slices of orange on a plate. By far the most bizarre and most expensive meal we have had which was not worth even £5 to make. We felt this was some kind of joke. Still can't quite believe it.

Each person ordered a few different dishes, the tables were full to the brim. I can honestly say that every single dish was incredible. The menu is full of choice, I’d recommend trying a few different things and sharing.

The only thing that let this experience down was the service, there was one waitress working and found it difficult to accommodate the 16 of us. Ordering took a really long time as she had trouble understanding what we wanted. The menu is numbered so we thought it would be simple enough but she said she didn’t know what each number was. Subsequently she then wrote down a few of our orders incorrectly.

But hey, the food completely overshadowed that one small issue. Will be returning frequently!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

It's still on the menu which is a bit misleading. I usually have a beef bibibap which is delicious but decided to try something else and had some starters and seafood yaki soba. I agree with other reviews, the starters are a bit expensive and the yaki soba was bland and not very nice. My friend wasn't that impressed with his meal choice either. The service was a bit patchy which I can forgive if the food is good but sadly this wasn't the case this visit. I would still highly recommend the bibibap menu and please can you can start serving sushi again? Thank you!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
329,pbfEngland,Dain Korea,4.0,Busy and good,"First time going to a Korean restaurant. We had very reasonable meals - agree that the starters are a bit expensive, but there is complimentary kim chee and also pickled radishes. There are also Japanese dishes on the menu, so there were things that all in our group could eat. There were a few things on the menu that weren't available on a Friday night, which was a bit unexpected (dessert, for one), but we were very happy to have eaten here and my daughter knew many of the Korean songs, so she was happy, too. Bibimbap - excellent, whether vegetarian, beef, chicken or raw beef. BYO, also.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
330,DBBristol,Dain Korea,4.0,Authentic Korean flavours,An amazing array of Korean dishes came to the table in no particular order as they were cooked - it made for an interesting meal. The restaurant is plain in decor and it doesn't need to make an effort as the food speaks for itself. It is BYO which makes it reasonably priced but not cheap. The food was spicy hot and flavoursome and we enjoyed all that we ordered.,"['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",0
331,gooseontour,Dain Korea,4.0,"Great mains, expensive starters, BYO!","Been here several times because it is BYO which is great!
Recommend number 75 on the menu (can't remember what it is called) but it is spicy and comes absolutely boiling hot so takes a while to eat.
Also reccomend the Bibimbap if you don't like spice as much - you can add as much hot sauce as you like , then you mix up all of the dish and it is delicious!

Would say avoid the starters as they are very expensive (£5-7) and you don't get as much compared to the mains!

Good place for a birthday meal, staff are great!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
332,freddylc,Dain Korea,5.0,Authentic and good value,"In contrast to the more westernised Korean/pan-Asian spots in Bristol, this place is a good shout if you’re looking for the real deal. It’s BYOB which is most definitely a plus in terms of value but implies a casual milieu. Would recommend for an impromptu dinner with friends. We were all very satisfied with our food (excellent kimchi) although I found the menu to be quite extensive and so it took some time for me to decide.

333,Antonia W,Dain Korea,5.0,Incredible Korean meal!,"Visited Dain Korea as a family for an evening birthday meal. Was not disappointed!
It's tucked away and is definitely not what you expect from the exterior. The waitress was lovely and attentive, easily explained ingredients of particular dishes.
We visited as a group of four and over-ordered, the side dishes are very generous (almost a full meal in themselves) and we were given plenty of Banchan (Korean side dishes) to accompany our meal.
Food was delicious, 2/4 had seafood dishes that were perfect. No nasty after effects either!
Super spicy and warming dishes, main meals plenty.
It has a BYOB policy on larger quantities of alcohol but does serve 2 types of Asian beer, along with soft drinks.

The decor is very street food style.
The staff very welcoming with a smile.
The menu is quite extensive and unless you have some guidance it is possible to select the wrong dish.
I has a sweet beef style dish accompanied with iceberg lettuce and a soya bean sauce .
My son had a dish with mixed veg and an egg on top and my wife had a chicken glass noodle one.

You even get the little kimchi and radish as a starter, which is brilliant also for those that never tried it so they can have a bit of a taste before ordering.

Initially the decor does not look that promising but that is not really the point here. It is functional and clean. However the food is what makes this place a real find. We had a starter of prawn Mandu which are like gyoza. Lovely flavour with a beautifully crisp edge. For mains I had the beef Bibimbap which was beautifully flavoured. Essentially a rice dish but once all the ingredients are mixed in the bowl as is the custom the texture and flavours are luxurious and finely balanced.My wife had a noodle dish which was just as good.

There was key Korean and Japanese dishes, but not enough of either.

However, the Korean Pork dumplings were not shop bought and very tasty - always a good thing! The Bib-am-bab was very average - Not something I'd be rushing back to have!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

The food was really good and fresh. However, service was not that good. We asked for 6 wine glasses (BYOB by the way), and we had to ask them to change three of them as they were really dirty (one of them even had some salad on it!!!). Then, we ordered some starters to share which were all great and 6 main course. As 5 of us had our meals served after 45 minutes wait after we finished the starters (which were not cleared from the table), one of us didn't get his meal. We had to ask the waiter for the 6th meal, which they forgot about. I noticed during the dinner that other tables were not cleared until someone else was arriving... Overall, a descent restaurant with good prices but a poor customer service experience.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",0

We were never asked if we wanted anything else, and when it came time to pay, again we had to go up and ask after waiting for ages!!
There were other people in the same situation- I even saw one customer walk out after waiting without being served.

I lived in Korea between 2002-2004 and since returning to the UK, I had struggled to find a place that served proper Korean grub. Until now. Dain Korea's food is as good as anything I've eaten in the motherland.

The decor is a little basic, and it's not the place you'd go to for a posh night out but if you're after some top nosh then give this place a whirl.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
360,Tooty88,Dain Korea,5.0,Friendly and fab food!,"My son recommended this restaurant but said it was very basic and that the food might not be for us.
He was wrong! This place provides Korean and Japanese food and is situated on busy Gloucester Road. It is unimposing from the outside but is clean and smart inside. Cooking is done by two very busy chefs in full view of diners. The waitress was Korean/Japanese herself and was only too willing to guide us through the extensive menu, most of which we couldn't understand.
I had a prawn tempura wrap to start with a bit of square of salmon and some wasabi which I was wary of from past experience- delicious - and for my main, a large bowl of rice, shredded veg, mushrioms, prawns etc., with a bowl of miso soup to mix in with it , all topped with an egg. Yum!
My husband had a chicken starter and a pork curry for his main which was too hot for him. The waitress was very concerned and said the chef would tailor any food to the required degree of hotness on a scale of 1-5.
We had green tea icecream to finish. You can bring your own wine but there is Japanese beer on offer which my husband said was very good, and a variety of teas and soft drinks.
This is an unpretentious, busy little place which provides super-fresh, tasty food at a reasonable price. The staff were lovely and for us it was nice to go somewhere a little different and guess what? - we are returning with visiting family in less than a week! By the way, my Malasian friend kniws this place well and recommends the Chilli Daddy takeaway ( they do those too).","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
361,K_Leeds,Dain Korea,3.0,Slow and poor service,"Waitress service is poor, missing out drink and food orders: they definitely need more training or be valued well as part of the team. We had to physically approach them and chase up missing drink and food items as it was difficult to get their attention. If they bothered to ask if we had sufficient drinks or if the meal was satisfactory; they will soon have realised the missing orders.
Trying to pay took a minimum of 15 mins despite physically going up to pay to try speed up the process.
Note : We were not the only ones in the same situation as others repeatedly asked for their bills.
Staff were slow at cleaning up other people's table on a hot summer day which is not pleasant to look at.
Poor management of table arrangement and greeting of new guests: doesn't create the best atmosphere.
Observation : sitting new customers down but not giving them a menu... Until the guests asked for a menu. And taking another table's order who sat down after them, at which the guests did comment.
Food was 'ok', starters are better than the mains if I'm honest: there are better Korean restaurants in Bristol. Will not be returning or recommending to friends/family.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

Very tasty and authentic korean food, almost same as the food I tasted when I was in Korea. The staff is very friendly and would advise on the menu. But the most amazing thing about them is that they do delivery, although not everywhere but if you are in the centre or around you are good. Me and my friends order delivery all the time and it's so useful especially during exam period when everyone is too busy with revision. But you have to order food for more than £20.

I told the charming and friendly waitress that I did not know Korean cuisine and asked her to recommend - she pointed me at bibimap. It's served in a hot earthenware bowl with boiled rice in the bottom (making it crispy), layered with cooked vegetable, choice of chicken, beef, pork, prawn or tofu (beef recommended and taken), and an egg so the flavours go down into the rice - served with your own bottle of red chilli paste so you can control how hot you want it. I loved it and can't wait to go back. We washed it down with a (375ml) bottle of 18% rice wine, that went well and had a clean slightly vodka-like flavour. With a couple of side dishes and salads, we happily paid £20 each and left feeling full and satisfied. The same menu is served for lunch, mostly at reduced prices - a definite bargain!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
366,tonydeltablues,Dain Korea,4.0,Good BYO Korean Restaurant,"We had a meal at Dain Korea for Mothers Day. We've been there before and I have gone for a cheap lunch on a few occasions.

Positives: It serves authentic Korean cuisine; the price is very reasonable (mains around £10.00); there is a great value (cash only) lunch menu; the Korean Set meals are good value if you are hungry.

Potential improvements: The interior is a little tired (previously, it was a short-lived burger joint) and it can lack a little 'ambiance' - that said, I quite like unpretentious cafes and restaurants.

On the day we visited, we had two children: they are from the lunch menu and my wife and I ate from the main Korean set meal. The kids liked their noodle dish (udon chicken noodles). Our menu consisted of lots of side dishes (as per Korean), kimchi, pickled vegetables, bulgogi (BBQ beef), kimchi pork and tofu stew, boiled rice.

We were full after that. Cost us around £58.00 with drinks total; we took our own wine.

Conclusions: If you want to try Korean food (a little different from your normal 'Asian' food) you should give it a go. Good place to go for lunch too. Perhaps not that a romantic setting for couples. Give it a go...","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

374,Francesco C,Dain Korea,2.0,Definitely not impressed !,"On our last day in Bristol we popped into this restaurant for lunch although it looked pretty empty. The ambience was a bit on the dark side and it didn’t appear very clean with an open kitchen that looked like a corridor. Once we sat down we ordered Mandu which I guess is the Korean version of Gyoza. The flavour wasn’t too bad although I would have left it a bit more in the pan to get the pastry a bit crispier. The Seafood Pancake (which didn’t appear to have much seafood inside) with spring onion wasn’t too bad either although the middle was uncooked and had a gluey consistency. Then came the masterpiece! We orderered 2 katsu curry (Chicken and Pork) from the special lunch menu but we got was 2 cutlets in gloopy sauce that I believe is a different dish and it remainded me of branston pickle! I had the pork and the colour of the meat was almost black and had a funny taste. My fiancé’s chicken was a touch better but again it had a funny taste. We complained and they asked if we wanted something else and because we were famished we asked if we could have 2 portions of Mandu instead which were the best part of our meal but this time they arrived undercooked and one of them was cold in the middle. I don’t have a problem if they were frozen before but at least they could have been cooked properly. It is not that they were too busy either, there was us and another table, so why the rush? We complained again and the waitress then later on the owner pretended that there was a misunderstanding regarding the curry. Well, that wasn’t our problem as we had ordered from the daily special menu and there was only one curry option! Anyway the owner wanted us not to pay the bill but we insisted that we wanted too and at end we paid for the 2 dishes we ate. This has to be one of the most unpleasant meals for sometime!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",0

377,tomv86,Dain Korea,4.0,Favourite Bristol restaurant,"Have been to Dain Korea three times now and have never been disappointed.

The service is always quick and friendly, the menu is quite expansive and the food is extremely cheap given its quality. BYOB keeps the bill right down, and means that this is a good place to dine with friends or in reasonably large groups.

Some might find the atmosphere a little strange - it's a small place, packed with seating, and the decor manages to be both sparse and eclectic (black and white prints of Amsterdam canals anyone?). For me this is a big plus - it's unpretentious and friendly and is a good sign that they are rightly concentrating on the quality of the food over style. Makes for a relaxed and welcoming meal.

The food is always fantastic - can't get enough of the kim chee, and the dolsot bibimbap is excellent. At this price you might expect rice dishes and the like to be stodgy and nondescript, but the spices and flavours are vibrant and crisp. There's an array of dishes and a lot of reasonably priced starters and sides so you can dip in and out of several different foods.

Menu is a bit light on vegetarian food which is why I can't give 5 stars - but that's more down to Korean cuisine I suspect than the restaurant itself. There's also quite a lot of tofu and vegetable dishes to keep you busy.

I always leave feeling happy and satisfied (as well as a little drunk). Long live Dain Korea!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

382,Carmen E,Dain Korea,5.0,YUM! - Great authentic food....one of our favourites!,"We found Dain Korea by accident – but it is now one of our favourites have been 5+ times!

The food is pretty amazing, great quality, fresh, tasty and plenty of it – plus the added extras like the miso soup are fab! For us, I think one of the biggest reasons we go back and have recommended Dain Korea to our friends and family is because it’s very good quality. The staff in particular are incredible friendly make us feel really welcome.

The sushi is pretty good too and smashes places like Yo Sushi out of the park.

The only thing I would say is that because it’s made to order, there can be a wait when it’s busy….but what would you rather? Microwaved precooked fast food or beautiful fresh dishes? It’s a no brainer.

It’s also BYO – for £2 a head bargain!
LOVE IT….can’t wait to return.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

Also recommend the bulgogi.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
386,Hyunho K,Dain Korea,5.0,"Fresh ingredients, authentic and great prices","As a Korean I can vouch for the dishes' authenticity. Really tasty food with fresh ingredients.
Apart from the prices, my favourite thing about the place was probably that they don't use MSG which can be commonly used in cheap oriental restaurants.
Friendly service too. The place is cheap and cheerful, don't expect luxurious decor.
If you are new to Korean, go for the classic bibimbap dish.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
387,geriatrix,Dain Korea,4.0,Excellent budget lunch,"Had a good lunch here, great value. They have both pork and chicken Korean curry dishes on the menu. I had the chicken, which was great, but I would have said that the sauce was nearer to sweet and sour than curry. I enjoyed it though. My wife had the pork, and that came with a completely different sauce, nearer to the sort of ""curry sauce"" you get from a Chinese takeaway. Anyway, she enjoyed it too! Although its a BYO, they do sell Korean beer.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

389,Sc_ottar,Dain Korea,4.0,"Still good, but standards are slipping slightly","We visited Dain Korea when it first opened and it was instantly one of my favourite restaurants. It offered great authentic Korean food and a great price. I was however a little disappointed about my last trip there. It seems like standards are starting to slip. The portions are getting smaller and the quality is starting to go down a little (mince beef in the Bibimbap rather than steak). I also feel that the prices have raised slightly. That said, this is still by far the best Korean restaurant in town (far, far better than Surakahn) and I will be returning soon, just maybe not quite as soon as I would have done based on my first impressions!","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
390,JennypennyGumdrop,Dain Korea,4.0,"A highly recommended friendly, good value for money restaurant.","This friendly, welcoming, bring your own restaurant is one of Gloucester Road's gems. The food is delicious, the prices low and the service laid back and friendly.

397,Jackie W,Dain Korea,4.0,Everyone should know about this place!,"I've been searching an authentic Korean restaurant in Bristol for ages - and this place has finally satisfied those cravings. Don't let its unpretentious decor fool you; despite being only a few months old, Dain Korea shows good variety in its menu and the dishes taste authentic. None of those letdown flavours adapted to cater to coddled, less adventurous palates. We're talking about the real deal here.

The staff are polite and attentive, and we were promptly served complimentary banchan of braised soy sauce eggs and spicy pickled shredded cabbage while we waited for our order. I ordered tteokbokki and pajeon, both of which were delicious. My companion, who was a Korean cuisine virgin prior to this visit, was happy with his bibimbap as well. Only been here twice - definitely looking forward to dining here again soon.","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1
398,18time,Dain Korea,5.0,Outstanding authentic Korean food at a good price,"I have been searching for a decent, reasonably priced Korea restaurant for years. I spent a year living in South Korea and generally I find that Korean restaurants in the UK are overpriced and the food is unauthentic. This is certainly not the case with Dain Korea. Typically under decorated which is pretty reminiscent of real Korean restaurants, the food is the main attraction. I'm so happy we went here and we will be coming back again and again. The staff are great and the lovely waitress who told me she was from Daegu was really friendly. I hope to go back once they are selling alcohol because the only thing that would make this better was if they also sold Makgeolli. As far as the food goes it was all exceptional. The bulgogi is as amazing as it should be and the bibimbap was delicious. The tang su yuk was a real treat as since leaving Korea I haven't been able to find this anywhere else; I'd recommend anyone who hasn't tried this to do so! Even if you've never tried Korean food before, you need to give this a go. You won't regret it. 10/10. 감사합니다","['bibimbap', 'ojingeochaebokkeum']",1

The service is outstanding and the food is delicious and bountiful. I got the Bulgogi entree and my Mom got Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop. We didn’t know that we also got all of these yummy side dishes too. The daughter of the owner came over to check on us. It was an excellent experience. I wondered if their food would taste like the Bulgogi I had in the 80’s back in Korea and it was!

The food here is very expensive compared to Korea, but we're not in Korea. This is a novelty restaurant worth trying. This food is very close to authentic and it is very good.

435,G9681FDfrancisb,Lime Orange,3.0,Good and Bad,"The King Prawn starter was delicious the Katsu chicken not so much. The vegetable dumplings were not good, the veggie in our group took a bite and suspected that it contained meat only after 3x going backwards and forwards were we able to determine that they contained quorn. This was very poorly handled and none of the servers seemed to know what the dumplings contained.
.
My main was half cold, 1/4 warm and 1/4 hot ... I was told that the hot bowl would warm my food but my friend had the same and her rice was too hot to eat so this cannot be the case. I chose to leave my food.
We also ordered spicy chicken wings which tasted nice but the waiters walked past our table multiple times and we were only given napkins after about 15 minutes.

They seemed to avoid the table seemingly not wanting to deal with the situation and probably not wanting us to ask for it to be removed from the bill. The bill came to £72 for the 4 of us we paid £20 each but would have been justified in not leaving a tip and requesting for the ""veg"" starter and main meal be removed. It's a shame that they didn't offer a better level of customer service, I can't in good faith reccommend them to others.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

444,Iain H,Lime Orange,5.0,Superb Korean Restaurant,"Lime Orange was a superb find. We had possibly one of the best Korean meals I have tasted outside of South Korea.

Lime Ornage does not take reservations and it is clear why. The restaurant is packed from opening until closing with queues out into the street throughout the evening. Tables are jam-packed into this tiny restaurant with hardly any space between them to squeeze into. But nobody minds being a little close to the next table of diners in an ultra-busy restaurant where the service never falters and the food is exquisite.

Lime Orange is situated directly opposite the Apollo Victoria, where Wicked has been playing for the past several years; it is a block from Victoria railway station, two blocks from HM Passport Office and three blocks from Buckingham Palace, so there is no end of potential passing trade.

Lime Orange is a family owned and run business and so service and food quality are given the highest priorities. No matter how busy the staff were, they remained attentive and friendly.

We will definitely return in the future.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

448,mcfc1964,Lime Orange,4.0,First taste of Korean food.,"Visited pre theatre and weren’t disappointed. We both went for the set meal number 2 which was gorgeous. Plenty of food, good value and friendly staff. One slight criticism, it felt like we were being rushed as the main meal was served before we’d finished our starter. Well worth a visit though.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
449,nmgayton,Lime Orange,4.0,Good meal - tight space,"Chose this restaurant as it was within walking distance to our hotel and based on TripAdvisor recommendations. This is a small floorplan with very limited seating and we had to wait on the sidewalk (fortunately less than ten minutes) before being seated as there is not a waiting area- reservations are strongly recommended. My spouse had the beef bulgogi and I had the bullgogi hot pot. Rice and sides were all extra and not included. Food was good, and the hotpot was excellent for the cold, damp evening.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

Will definitely return","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
452,mis-jay,Lime Orange,4.0,"Not bad, would return a 2nd time","I made a reservation for 2 people by calling the day earlier. I turned up the next day on time but the whole restaurant was packed and not a single table was empty. I informed them of my reservation and the 2 staff didn't seem to be aware of the reservation. So I was made to wait for 5-6 mins while they cleared up a table for me.

We ordered the following to about £45:
- Veg mandu - not tasty, just average but the apple cide vinegar dip was nice
- Spicy Calamari - the best dish of everything we had. the sauce is sweet & spicy.
- Pa jeon - seafood pancake was tasty as well
- Kimchi fried rice - shouldn't have ordered this as it was bland and the kimchi wasn't as spicy or tasty. Served with a lovely Miso soup however!
- Chicken spicy noodles - had a spicy taste and the chicken tasted good.

very generous portions of the rice and noodles. We were sated at the end. The mains were disappointing but the starters were good. Would prolly order their popular Bibimbap next time.

The staff were friendly and the service was quick considering the crowded place. however I felt that 2 people are not enough to run the service and reception. Definitely need another pair of hands on a busy afternoon.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

We ordered a starter and main course each and were more than satisfied with the portion sizes.
The spicy calamari and Pa Jeon pancake starters were very good and no sooner had we finished than the main courses arrived. my wife loved the chicken bimimbap and for me, the beef bulgogi (with lettuce and rice) was truly delicious! we had a kimchee cucumber and pear salad with the mains and that was outstanding! Fresh and delicious. It's a shame the Korean beer was tasteless, but everything else was great and the young staff were really helpful and friendly.

457,Loulafanoula,Lime Orange,4.0,Great food!,"We called to book only to be told 'dont worry plenty of tables'. Arrived 15 mins later - none available. Luckily for us a table didn't turn up so we got it!
Never eaten Korean before. Didn't really know what to order. Everyone around us had mountains of food that looked amazing.
Went for a few starters and beef bullogi (?) for main. SO TASTY!!!!
Unfortunately nothing we ordered looked like what the other diners were eating but nevertheless what we got was great. We asked the waitress for a few dishes pointing out some other tables but due to the language barrier she didn't really understand what we meant.
Chopsticks and a spoon (for the soup I guess) no other cutlery. We used the chopsticks for about 5 mins then gave up and went for the spoon feeling a little silly as everyone else using them with ease.
Tables a little sticky.
Reasonably priced food.

458,SunriseSki,Lime Orange,5.0,Excellent Korean,"On a Saturday evening without reservation, we tried our luck. We looked inside from the window, it looked packed with a party of three already waiting. We were immediately welcome by a waiter, who told us “5 minutes” and shorter than that a table became free and we had our place. The dishes came surprisingly fast, and were simply delicious and authentic (we have extensive travel experience to Korea). We loved the Katsu, the Bibimbab, the Bulgogis. They even import a Korean beer. Despite the hectic of a Saturday night, the staff was all calm, efficient and very personal and friendly. The prices are reasonable. Overall a great family-run establishment that we can warmly recommend!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

It's close to both the Apollo & Palace theatres, but I strongly suggest booking ahead if you want to go pre-theatre - not on the day, as they don't take same day bookings.

We were not sure what to order so in the end went for some starters and one main course which was plenty between the 4 of us. The tempura prawns were amazing and the calamari in the sticky sweet and sour sauce was amazing
The staff were really nice, very cheerful and helpful

465,BabySinclair,Lime Orange,4.0,Busy Korean restaurant near Victoria Station,"I ended up going here twice on my most recent visit to London. Once of my own volition and again on the recommendation of a friend - I wasn't complaining. The first time I had the tofu salad and jeon, both OK for vegans, although a couple more members of staff could do with knowing what is and isn't vegan on their menu. These choices were decent if a little greasy. The second time when I went back I had the tofu bibimbap and that was pretty impressive. The restaurant is very close to Victoria station and not all that expensive. It was packed both nights and I would go again.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
466,Sarah P,Lime Orange,4.0,Great food at a really good price considering the location,A colleague recommended this place as I was meeting a friend straight from work and it was close by. Given that we went on a Monday evening and were starving at 6.30 we figured it would be pretty quiet there but the place was heaving - always a good sign. We had one of the set menus and I have to say it was all delicious. The staff were all friendly and realised that we hadn't had Korean food before so explained how we were supposed to assemble one of the dishes (we'd have worked it out but was nice to be helped) My only slight negative point was that the tea was very weak; I had the Korean tea which had some flavour but my friend had the green tea and said that it tasted of nothing but hot water. I will definitely be back,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
467,EmilyA_12,Lime Orange,5.0,Family pre theatre dinner,"What to say other than this place exceeds expectations. I'm very difficult to please when it comes to eating out and really struggled to choose from the menu as everything sounded good. The staff were brilliant, giving us time and answering many questions. I was recommended the kimchi soup which comes with rice. Others had the noodles or bibimbap. When they arrived, portions were huge but with lots of flavour. The bibimbaps were incredible but I think the kimchi soup won hands down. Hot, spicy and full of ingredients I can't wait to come back to have it again. Can't stress enough how great this place is!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We booked by phone the day before and were glad we did. We arrived just after 5.30pm and by 6pm they had a queue outside.

We shared a number of starters including chilli chicken wings and the (giant) prawns. We then tried the bibimbap and beef bulogi with lettuce and rice. Both fantastic!

471,Charlotte T,Lime Orange,5.0,Very tasty first experience of Korean food,"We were running very late for grabbing a pre-theatre meal..saw this restaurant directly opposite Apollo Victoria theatre was busy so assumed it must be good food.

472,LawranceTraveller,Lime Orange,5.0,Fantastic intro to Korean food,"We needed to find food quite quickly in the Victoria area. A look on TA and we decided on this place. No regrets!

Ambience: busy, tight-packed, bustling eatery. First thing we noticed - lots of Koreans. Always a good sign when people recognise their own cuisine!

Service: despite pressure, friendly and attentive. Very good.

Food: outstanding. We had Seafood bibimbap (for me) and Chicken katsu with udon noodles (for her). But we shared each other’s. Both very good - the bibimbap possible the more interesting and, in its massive stone bowl, stayed piping hot for ever.

Drink: a had Hite beer - fine with the food.

Value: good, we felt, given location. £31.68, Inc pre-included service charge. The tip would have been bigger if it hadn’t been included!

Verdict: I want to go back!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

477,RebeccaJayne93,Lime Orange,4.0,Great food,"Everything pictured below cost around £33- including drinks. The picing is incredibly good. The only downside was that we were a party of two, who wanted to order the bbq, but could only do so if we ordered 3 persons worth of food. My friend and I wanted to try a variety of foods so opted for a shared selection.

The ttoboki was incredibly tasty, but as avid spicy food/ hotpot eaters it was not spicy enough. When I return I plan to ask for it to be spicier.

The staff were incredibly nice- specially the young man who served us. We order just before the place became busy, and eventhough the place was packed, he was still incredibly polite and full of smiles. As we sat down he offered to put our suitcases and bags outback. We didn't catch his name, but we arrived at the place on the 03/ 06 and would really like to praise him for his servicing.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

482,LauraC4712,Lime Orange,4.0,Popular for a reason,"Perfectly located for the Apollo theatre (Wicked), this is a great place for a pre-show meal. They open at 5 and when we arrived at about 5 past there were already 2 tables seated. By half past the restaurant was full and people were waiting. We were asked if we had a reservation (which we didn't) and I would certainly recommend booking if planning to arrive any later than we did. The food was well explained on the menu and the friendly staff were on hand to help make recommendations. Service was extremely quick (in fact we were in and out in just over an hour) and the food is all brought out as soon as it is ready without a clear gap between courses. This might bother some people but I didn't feel like we were being rushed. The food itself was beautifully presented and of good quality. Having not tried Korean food before I found the flavours a little disappointing (slightly bland) compared to some other Asian cuisines, but I think that's more personal taste. Overall I would definitely recommend the place for a value for money pre-show meal if you like Asian food.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

I had Kimchee Jeon and Kimchee Bibimbap - I have a serous Kimchee obsession lately and it was yum. My meet eating companion loved his Spicy Calamari and Seafood Udon.

Not a place I'd take young children in buggies as space is tight though.

As a vegetarian the choice was limited so I had the Tofu Udon and the ladies had Chicken Katsu Udon. The noodles were barely warm and generally the meal was bland and uninteresting. The people on the table across looked to have made a better choice with a colourful rice dish.

I understand why Lime Orange don't take bookings between 18:00-19:30, so my tip is to get there early (17:30 latest) if you want to get a table and enjoy this delicious food without being too rushed. A queue developed at times, but was quite fast moving.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

The restaurant is quite small and is always busy so booking is recommended for parties of 4+ at peak times. Despite being always busy, they take the orders and serve the food fairly quickly.
Our favourite dish is the bibimbap, a Korean rice dish served in a bowl that it is so hot that anything that touches it sizzles for minutes. They have different options and I have personally tried this with tofu, kimchee and seafood, but they also have meaty options like chicken and beef. If you order a bibimbap you get a miso soup included in the price (~£10) too.

511,PlamenB27,Lime Orange,3.0,The food I found to be nice but overpriced. The service - very average,"I've been to this restaurant about five times over the last year or so and I can confidently say the the following three things have been consistent every time
- The food was nice enough
- The price was more than I'd expect
- The service was rushed and bordering unpleasant

I can explain a little more.

On points 1 & 2 - the food is OK, authentic - can't say, nice enough- yes. But overpriced. Within a few minutes walk of this place you can have the same quality Korean food at a much reasonable price.

On point 3 -
The space is very limited and that's fine but to be asked to wait until ""the rest of your party arrives"" before you are given a table ""because they don't want to lose a seat"" is not something I want to do. To me that tells me I am valued less than the restaurant selling a table/seat. I accept that this could be perfectly fine for many but is not for me.

Overall average is the best I can give this place and I'm aiming not to visit again.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

Mine had lovely tasty fluffy rice with 7 or 8 different types of steamed vegetable, pork that had been marinated in a delicious sesame-y marinade, and a little bowl of miso soup on the side, while my wife's dinner consisted of a beautiful fragrant soup with delicious marinated beef in it, with a bowl of that lovely rice on the side. I was also delighted to see they serve Makgeolli, that lovely Korean light rice wine. The place was absolutely heaving, with a queue of people out the door, many or whom were Koreans, though we only had to wait 10 mins or so to be seated. The service was quick and friendly, and we left 40 mins later with smiles on our faces.

Korean food can be light, even vegetarian, spicy or not depending on your preference, and the kimchee won't upset the people sitting next to you in the theatre. I had udon noodles, supposedly spicy; they weren't piquant but they were fresh and umami. My friend had bibimbap with tofu. Both dishes were generous and filling. We shared kimchee pancakes, like potato pancakes but crunchier. Service was unobtrusive and efficient. Arrive early for pre-theatre because it gets crowded the closer you get to show time.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We love the cucumber kimchee and beef bimbibap but the chicken and ramen was too spicy for us. However some people might like the 'spicyness' so this is relative. The atmosphere is typical asian cafe place but it did feel a bit cramp but I think that is because the restaurant was trying to pack as many seats as possible to maximum sales which is understandable. The service was good and the staff was friendly. Also, this place only take cash so bear that in mind. In summary, this is definitely an option for a pre-theatre meal and I would go back again if I am around the neighbourhood and if I crave for Asian food.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

536,Kelly V,Lime Orange,4.0,Decent Korean grub round the corner from Victoria,"The restaurant is conveniently located less than 5 minutes walking from Victoria train/coach/underground station, so it's a busy area but the restaurant itself is away from most of the footfall. While we were there however, at around 7pm midweek, the restaurant was consistently busy with a constant stream of diners.

It's pretty small and quite cramped, and it was slightly uncomfortable having the waiting diners practically hanging over our table, so ideally they should carve out a space for waiting (but then they'd lose a table and welcome income, I imagine)

That said, the food was great! Not quite up there with Kimchi in Holborn but far cheaper, good portion sizes & a really good selection on the menu. Was pleased to see a tofu bibimbap for veggies.

The kimchi wasn't quite spicy enough for our liking and the mandu (dumplings) were only lukewarm but these are mild complaints and all was worth it for the delicious bibimbaps which we spent an hour over, scraping the burnt rice from the bottom of the stone bowl (don't judge, it's the best part)

The service was also very friendly, all the servers were smiley and helpful, if a little rushed. Overall, I would recommend a visit to Lime Orange with friends for something quite quick (or even alone at the window bench), but probably not for a romantic meal, or for somewhere to relax with drinks for a while.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

540,ridwanb2015,Lime Orange,4.0,Friendly service and tasty Yangyeum Chicken!,"Came here for a casual meal with a friend (who's quite a foodie) based on reviews and the apparent halal options available (there is a sign in the window saying the chicken is halal, and the member of the waiting staff that I asked said the same).

We hadn't booked and managed to get a table, but it turns out we definitely should have if we were planning on coming a bit later (we got there a little before 18:30 I think)! The restaurant got packed pretty quickly but not in chaotic manner, and the service we received was very friendly and helpful throughout.

As I said in the title, the Yangyeum chicken (which we shared for starters) was very tasty and the batter was crispy. For mains I went for the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi, with lettuce and rice, and my friend went for the Beef Bibimbap (which comes with rice). I enjoyed my dish, even if I struggled a little at first with how to eat it (the waiter did very politely give me advice when they served it), and my friend described their course as okay (I'd say I'm less fussy than them :P, but if they say it's ""okay"", it's ""good"" for me, and if they say it's ""amazing"", it's ""really good"" for me).

Tables were generally clean though one or two spots seemed a little sticky, and the toilets (well, I can only comment on the men's) seemed to be kept in good condition. Food was served fairly promptly and, despite how busy it was getting with people waiting to be seated, we were never made to feel rushed or anything like that. It's not that expensive, but I think if it were a little cheaper, I'd be likely to come back here for a quick bite if I were in the area.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We had a show to see across the street at Apollo Victoria, and were, unfortunately, a little short on time. Service was quick and friendly, and the food came out fresh, hot, and absolutely delicious.

I haven't had Korean food very often, but Lime Orange is the best I've had. The spicy calamari we tried as a starter had a couple of pieces that were a little chewy, but most were just about perfect. I really liked their kimchi, too. I had chicken katsu udon, and the chicken was crisp, moist, and the sauce was very good. The noodles and vegetables perfectly cooked, in my opinion.

My husband had the pork belly bulgogi with fresh lettuce leaves, and he loved it.

The portion sizes seemed very generous to us, and we both had to leave some on our plates, leaving full and satisfied with our dinner.

It is a small place, maybe a bit cramped if you're a bit of a larger build, and they were completely full our entire visit. I imagine they often are.

The chilli chicken lacked some umph and the katsu just needed some more sauce or jus or something to help it along. I think this would be much better in the restaurant.

From the outside, Lime Orange doesn’t look much. But at 615 on a Monday evening it was almost full and tables filled as soon as they became free. People obviously knew something we didn’t!

Service was prompt and friendly. And the food was excellent. This was my first Korean meal so my colleague ordered two different Bulgogi and some side dishes. And I was instantly hooked! Fresh, tasty, well-prepared and super tasty.

And very reasonable at £25 for more than enough food washed down with a Korean Hite beer each.

Such an unexpected gem amidst the tourist rip-offs in the area!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The beef soup is filling and really hearthy. 4.50£ (takeaway) for a portion and it is quite cheap and healthy as well. My korean workmate loves their soup. That tells alot about it. I will definitely return. They accept only cash for order below 7£ and it can get quite packed during lunch time.

580,chinesesun,Lime Orange,4.0,Very Good Korean Standards,"This restaurant was near perfect for a casual bus inn luncheon. Standards such as kimchi, bulgolgi and grilled meats at the table were served in good portions and were satisfying. The restaurant was a bit noisy, not not distracting. The noise added a layer of confidentiality to the business discussion.

The restaurant has room for improvement. The added chili was a limp bottled sauce. There were no small dishes, typical of more upscale places. And the seafood in the bulgogi was small in size and a tad light in volume within the dish. Though the cuisine was geared for a British audience, there were several Koreans among the clientele.

Prices were reasonable and service was good.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We were seated as it opened at 5 as were several other tables; the service was efficient but not rushed - they are clearly used to the pre-theatre crowd. But oh my goodness, the food! It was delicious! A Korean food fan in our group ordered a variety of dishes for us and she was seriously impressed, I just kept eating. The food was fresh and plentiful and superb. So concentrated were we on our dinner, that we’d not noticed the restaurant was packed and folk were waiting.

The waiter came to explain how we should enjoy the food. He is very friendly and we spend some time to talk to him about Korean culture as well. The food taste so good that make me feel like I am in Korean. We finished our dinner within a hour and people was waiting for the seat.

587,Deborah B,Lime Orange,1.0,A non starter!,Meeting a friend for lunch we thought we would try Lime Orange. When we arrived it was really busy but there was a table for 4 available so we sat ourselves down and waited to be served. After five minutes we were told that as there was only 2 of us we had to move and join the table behind us. We did ask if we could stay on our table and other people join us but they wanted to keep the table for 4 free just in case a party of 4 walked in. So we joined the other table (although the current occupants were a little taken aback) but there really was not much room for 4 and couldn’t talk freely. Then table for 2 became available so we moved to the free table. We were then told we couldn’t have this table as it had been reserved! So no one waiting. A table for 4 and a table for 2 unused but we could only join a table already occupied by 2 people. At the point we felt very unwelcome and decided to leave. My view on the food can’t be included but we definitively did not feel the love! Looking at other posts it seems we aren’t the only ones dissatisfied with their seating technique. If you want Korean food then give it a try but if there are just 2 or less in your party then find somewhere a bit more welcoming.,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

I found the service to be brisk and efficient, food great - i had the seafood bibimbap (lots of seafood - delicious) and my friend chose the pork belly with rice and lettice (which he enjoyed too).

The restaurant has a row of tables - galley style - quite close together - but we did not find this uncomfortable and were able to converse well.

Beers were bottled (korean and japanese offered) and served cold.

We had an enjoyable couple of hours at this restaurant - and although the menu may be somewhat limited ( compared to a previous visit I had to a Korean restuarant) the food smacks of Korean flavours.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

596,happypanda17,Lime Orange,5.0,Perfect Korean food located near the theatre,"We went to Lime Orange before seeing Hamilton - the distance between the theatre and restaurant is minimal. If using Google maps you are sent to the back of the building so maybe ask a nearby shop for directions if you are not sure. The restaurant decor is basic but comfortable. There is a takeaway menu available.

Food was great, affordable and came out promptly. Our server was friendly and efficient. The bibimbap was amazing and reminded me of my travels in Korea. The kimchi is homemade and pairs well with the dishes. The main dishes are a good portion size and will keep you full. The barley tea is a really lovely way to finish the meal and tastes like coffee. The only element of the meal I was disappointed in was the black sesame ice cream: the concept is a good idea however the ice cream had ice crystals.

Overall this is a good restaurant for those who love no frills, yummy Korean food.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We ordered a bottle of soju between us, jug of water, Japchae, Kimchee Jeon, Cucumber Kimchee and the Spicy chicken bulgogi with rice and lettuce. All dishes were super tasty and all worked well together along with all the dipping sauces on the table. Needless to say my friend lived the food and was impressed by how good it was compared to other places she's tried.

We reconfirmed our reservation two days before as we were travelling 60 miles into London to meet friends for supper. We arrived on time to be informed yes they had our reservation but they had no tables available. We would have to wait standing for maybe twenty minutes and then he could squeeze five of us onto a table for four. Said he was sorry and they just overbooked tables. This was said matter of factly -it would appear to be their normal practice. No free drink offered if we chose to wait. We left and found a good restaurant nearby. The front of house staff couldn’t have cared less. With such an indifferent cavalier attitude to customers you have to wonder what happens in their kitchen.

We had kimchi pancake, spicy chicken, dolsot bibimbab, chicken katu with udon noodle, hot pot bulgogi. The flavour was there but all of were over sweetened.

623,Ruth K,Lime Orange,2.0,Poor understanding of food allergies - allergic customers beware!,"This restaurant doesn't seem to understand the seriousness of food allergies. I have a very serious - potentially life-threatening - nut allergy so when we arrived I specifically told the waiter that I had a nut allergy when we ordered our mains, and asked him to go and check that the food didn't have nuts in.

After we'd eaten our main meal (which was delicious - best bibimbap in London!), I asked a waitress for the dessert menu. She said there was just green tea icecream for dessert, so we ordered some. When it came, I tried some and I thought it had nuts in - which the staff confirmed - although they hadn't felt it necessary to mention when I ordered! I thought this was really poor, particularly as I'd explicitly let them know about my allergy.

Fortunately, I only ate a tiny quantity of the ice-cream, so I didn't have a serious anaphylactic allergic reaction, just stomach cramps and some difficulty breathing. But someone with a more serious allergy than mine could easily have died from that - so Lime Orange needs to do a lot better to support its customers with allergies.

I really wouldn't recommend eating here if you have serious food allergies!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

We both had the Bibimbap after asking for recommendations from the waiter, which he carefully explained along with some other items on the menu that we had never heard of. Once the food arrived we were instructed what it was and how you are supposed to eat it. Overall the food was both tasty and inexpensive and the service was very good. We'll definitely make a visit during our next stay in London!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

638,Andrew A,Lime Orange,5.0,Miss ing home food,"Saw Lime Orange on TI with great reviews; once again I must agree with my fellow TI reviewers! Having lived in Korea of and on for 12 years this is a good Korean restaurant. They would do well in Korea. They do not serve all the side dishes like you would find in the Kunsan region, but that aside it is good Korean food. We had the Bi-Bin with beef and one with seafood.
The place is smallish by England standards, maybe seating 50 to 60 people. We walked in and there were two tables open for two people each. From 1900 to 2000 (Thursday) we saw they had to turn away a dozen people; very popular!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
639,Nikhil V,Lime Orange,3.0,Food was ok............,"Had dinner with some friends on a Saturday evening. Didn't have to wait for a table at 19:00. We ordered a few dishes and the food was perfectly fine. I just didn't feel any of the food was really great given the other reviews. I ordered the Kimchi-jjigae but found it to be a little too watery (more like a soup than a stew). Staff were attentive and overall it was a fair experience. I would also say the place is quite small, and the seating on the wall was a little uncomfortable. Two starters, a side dish and three mains with drinks for three people came to around £60","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

641,I1428ZBbrianm,Lime Orange,5.0,Excellent pre-theatre dinner venue,"My wife and I had tickets to see Wicked, as part of our first wedding anniversary, and wanted somewhere local to the theatre to enjoy a pre-show dinner. I took a chance on google to suggest venues and Lime Orange came up as one of the top recommendations so off we went.

It was exactly the right choice. The service was quick and very efficient, despite it being very busy, almost full. The food was absolutely superb. I chose the spicy chilli prawns for a starter, my wife the Tofu salad. The prawns were huge and incredibly well done, the sauce perfect. My wife's salad was exactly the same, simple but excellent. For mains I had the Katsu chicken curry, my wife the Tofu Bibimbap. Again, both were simply perfect.

However, beyond the food, there was one thing that makes us give this restaurant the 5* it deserves. We arrived with enough time to eat before curtain up. However each set of diners who arrived after us were asked if they were going to the theatre. As time closed on curtain up each new customer was advised of how long each sitting might take and that they may not make curtain up.

This restaurant was willing to lose covers to allow them to get to the show on time. That's a very unselfish and utterly professional decision that favours the customer.

My wife and I will go back for the food alone and will definitely recommend it to anyone wanting sensibly priced, beautifully cooked food, excellent service and an eye for customer service second to none.

Go visit....","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

All waiters are very nice, although very busy as the place is packed.

We ordered Bibimbap, beef BBQ, rice, Kimchee, but beef was thick and dried, seems not marinated enough and so it was different from what I expected.
When we got a bill, we found that they added service fee and I was surprised as casual restaurant like this normally do not add.

647,Daniel B,Lime Orange,1.0,Didn't even sit down,"I've never felt so unwelcome at any restaurant in my life. In 5 minutes it became apparent the money grabbing philosophy in which they work, so I didn't even get to sit down.

First of, when I arrived a party of 4 arrived behind me. The waiter didn't even look at me and got them a table first. I attempted to speak out but neither waiter or customers were bothered.

But the worse part came next, when I finally got some attention, I asked for a table for 1. The waiter said at the moment they only had the counter which is just next to the door. As this was the windiest and rainiest day of the last month, I said I'd prefer not to. I wanted a small table. This was flat out refused. When I asked why I couldn't get a table, the waiter said if a party of 2 comes then they always have priority. Mind you, no one was waiting behind me at this point and I still got told I could only get my table an hour later when for them it was unlikely to be able to fill it up with 2 people.

Such short-sighted vision to customer service can only be from team orders and not a one-time experience. This made me leave straight away with the promise of never returning.

I'm in restaurants all the time because of work and this is the first time anything remotely similar happened to me. Bad service might not translate directly to bad food in the short run but it will eventually catch up and they will lose their customers. Unacceptable.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

First the place is very crowded which by itself is not bad ( may indicate good food) , but after waiting a while the get seated, we found out that the Korean bear was not cold and there were couple of other options that we didn't look or. The appetizers were really small and the kimchi was not very pickled but rather mushy and not to much flavor. Also the barbecue was not crisp and not very well marinated. And to top everything we almost got embarrassed at the end when we were told that their card reader wasn't working and that we should go across the street to get some cash.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0
651,IzzMc_2016,Lime Orange,5.0,Hidden Gem,"We almost walked straight past Lime Orange, and honestly from the outside it doesn't do much to entice you in. However we had heard good things about the place and decided to give it a go, and we are so glad we did. It is a small restaurant, but cosy (if a little bit on the warm side). The menu offers a good amount of choice but is not at all daunting.

We started off sharing some Soy chicken, which were good, but a fairly big portion for just one person, and the japchae (delicious) and vegetable mandu (brilliant). The pork bulgogi was incredibly good, possibly the best I have had. It was all presented well; you mix up the meat and rice with the sauce and stuff it into the lettuce leaves, which makes for a filling tasty meal.

The service was slightly on the slow side but the food was all so good and the waiter was helpful so we didn't really mind a bit of a wait. This will definitely become one of our regular haunts and we look forward to coming back again.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
652,Elizabeth-Therese,Lime Orange,4.0,Great Korean food all in a little place,"This restaurant is small in terms of the space internally but the food was very nicely seasoned and the price was friendly in the pocket.

We love the Kim chi chigee (the preserved cabbage soup) as it came with rice. The chapchae was ok and the bugolgi both beef and the chicken, I personally enjoyed the beef better.

The only thing is that it looks like there were only one or two waitress/waiter there to serve so when it is busy over lunchtime, you do have to have a little patient.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

For London it stands out as great value for money and generous portions with quality to match.

Food was good but I just feel it is a very tiny restaurant and there are too many tables crammed in and it makes getting comfortable and enjoying your meal not a great experience. I don't like the next table practically sitting in my lap when eating, but of course this is a personal thing and other folk may not mind this.

692,aza484,Lime Orange,3.0,Disappointed in the decline over last 6 months,"When we discovered this local, family-run Korean place 2 years ago it immediately became a big hit with our office - multiple trips per week to begin with, and then settling at a consistent weekly or fortnightly visit ever since. I would bring friends & family here when visiting the city for the weekend, and advocate people go out of their way even to seek it out. Their yangyeum chicken starter was to die for, their bibimbaps tasy, and their pork bulgogi especially good.

Unfortunately, my regular lunch pal and I have noticed a steady decline in portion size and food quality over the last 6 months or so, alongside a slow rise in prices. We have often remarked before while dining here, how pleased we are that this brilliant little friendly restaurant had not succumbed to the trend only too often seen at local establishments that gain popularity - that temptation to try to further increase profit margins by switching to cheaper cuts of meat, changing suppliers (and suffering a noticeable dip in quality), and getting stingy with portions. Unfortunately this has now happened.

First our beloved yangyeum chicken - previously so good that we had visited and ordered only two portions of this delicious starter each as our meals - was switched from a generous pile of easy-to-eat boneless chicken (thigh I'd guess?), to chicken wings instead - without any change to the menu I should add. Next, the generous portion was downsized to just 5 wings (tested on multiple occasions for consistency). And finally, the price was actually INCREASED.

Now many people very much enjoy chicken wings, so what's wrong with that, you might ask? Well, for the tourists who might wander in once on their visit to see Buckingham Palace, absolutely nothing. But for those living or working locally, we know better. We know what came before. And I'll tell you this for nothing - bitesize pieces of dark meat are far easier to eat cleanly with chopsticks while on an office lunch break or having a business meeting, than fiddly little battered wings smothered in a very sticky spicy-sweet sauce.

We've also observed a decrease in the bibimbap sizes, smaller portions of accompaniments, increased greasiness and lower quality of meats (e.g. the belly pork), and further subtle price increases across the menu.

I think we feel particularly strongly just because of how much love we had for this place initially, and what a stark contrast there is. The first time we went after they'd made the thigh to wing switch, the waiting staff actually apologized to us for the change when we ordered, knowing full well we'd be disappointed. Now, they simply look at us apologetically when we arrive in the doorway.

Sadly, while we've really been trying to keep coming, our regular visits may now have come to an end, the decline has crossed a threshold.

Like many of the best things in life, it seems it couldn't last forever.

TL;DR - if you're in town for the weekend, fancy some Korean and are in the area, you could do far worse than Lime Orange. If however you've been before and loved it, say a year ago or so - don't come back, you'll be sorely disappointed.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

It was very different but equally tasty, coming with noodles instead of rice and a much tarter and thinner sauce. The green tea ice-cream was also very nice. Service a little slow, although if you intend to make a whole evening of it then that's not really a problem. Small restaurant, I'd advise booking as it's clearly popular at the weekends.

713,Monty M,Lime Orange,3.0,First time in Korea; interesting experience,"As a Korean-eating virgin, this was a new one on me and chosen primarily as a lunch venue because of its proximity to Victoria station.

The reason for lunch was a quarterly meeting with an ex-client who has become a friend and we enjoyed the experience.

The service was excellent after we explained our inexperience, but found it difficult to eat our pork belly in lettuce parcels with rice, so reverted to normal eating practices.

The restaurant was busy and the clientele interesting although the tables were very close together, making it feel like a cafe more than a restaurant. That meant I marked it down from a four-start to a three-star experience.

This is an excellent place to eat decent food when travelling to and from Victoria station, especially because of the other execrable restaurants in the area, but probably not worth travelling too far for.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

When I came the place was quite empty, I was welcomed by very friendly waiter and sat next to the window. In a few minutes all spaces were taken and the place was buzzing, but the only waiter was speedy, nice and paying everyone equal attention.
I am a huge fan of Korean food, growing up in the country with lots of Korean expats, so I browsed through the menu and appreciated the selection.
I haven't had bibimbap in ages so opted for it with extra kimchi. When it has arrived, all bright and colourful on the sizzling hot plate, along with some miso on the side and hot sauce I thought it was too beautiful to eat. At the end, the dish ended up being glorious, with all ingredients fresh and flavourful. Definitely recommend.
The also have a lunch special that is different every day, which I think is a great value.
Will repeat my visit next time I am around the area.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

I had found this little gem through Google suggestions by checking what Asian restaurants were nearby and decided to give this place a try based on the impressive 4 star+ reviews.

The first time I visited Lime Orange I got dinner take out. The restaurant was packed on a weekday night, and once I walked in, the food smelled authentic and right. I got the beef bibimbap (mixed rice bowl), and it was delicious! I had gone back several times afterwards, and also tried dining at the restaurant. Other dishes I enjoyed were the japchae (glass noodle stir fry), dukbokgi (rice cake in spicy sauce), pa jeon (seafood pancake), and tofu soup.

Just a gentle reminder that for those dining in, try and avoid wearing knits because the restaurant does have bbq and grill options, and the smell can ""stick"" to your clothes. Service is friendly and prices are reasonable. They do take rsvps, except between 6:15pm and 7:30pm.

They have a great daily lunch menu where you can eat in for £4.99 or take away for £3.99. It's a small restaurant so do book ahead if you are going in large numbers.

Only downfall was that I wanted my bibimbap fix but they ran out of rice. I ended up ordering Yukgaejang soup and they offered noodles as an alternative and it was lovely. Never tried that before and now its something I would have again.

The glass noodle salad with the same Bolgogi Beef, but served hot was so much more pleasant. Other Koreans do serve their salads with heated beef and it helps the flavour really come out nicely.

It's a small Korean food place.

Narrow room with tables down one side so atmosphere is limited, but don't let that put you off as the food really is Top notch and very reasonably priced.

The chicken starter we had was served pipping hot and very tasty. The main was served with obvious fresh vegetables and again tasty, fresh and hot.

The prices were good .... starters from 4-8 quid and mains from around 9 quid upward. Sides a couple.of quid.

Service was quick, friendly and efficient.

A meal for two with starters, mains and a beer was basically 50 quid. Not bad for central London.

Lime Orange seemed a good choice, and we were delighted with this tiny place. I would never have entered the restaurant had it been by looks alone, as the exterior is not very inviting but once inside the door the room was clean, quite smart and we were shown to our table by a very polite and friendly waiter. We got a table at 5.30 with ease, and soon after the tiny restaurant quickly filled up. We were given advice about food choices. The BBQ chicken was delicious and sizzlingly hot, and the pork bibimbap was equally good. Although we ordered rice with the chicken, we didn't need it as we shared both dishes, and there was plenty for two ladies.
The service was very quick and friendly as they are very used to people going to the Apollo Victoria theatre which is immediately across the road. Ignore Google maps advice as that will direct you to the back entrance!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The food was delicious. We shared a dish of Kimchi followed by Hot Stone Pot Biminbap and a Spicy Chicken Bulgogi with fresh lettuce on the side.

762,glennosaurus,Lime Orange,5.0,Korean delight,"On the 11th of July 2016 we had tickets to see the Wicked theatre show. After picking up our tickets at the box office we were looking for a quick but good quality meal before seats opened for the show and a place close to the Apollo Victoria Theatre.

Based on Tripadvisor reviews we chose to visit Lime Orange with a family of four, two adults and two daughters, one hour before seats open for Wicked. We ordered fried calamari for starters, then bibimbap, soup and noodles with fried chicken. Everything was tasty and stupendous in flavour, texture and temperature.It was our first experience with Korean food, but based on this first encounter I'm sure more will follow. Our daughters, who at first protested as we were visiting 'asian again', really loved the tasty food. Service was fast and helpful and accommodating. Highly recommended!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

food was excellent and full of flavour, portions generous. slightly disconcerted about starters and mains etc arriving all at the same time.

766,bronweng148,Lime Orange,5.0,Perfect pre theatre meal,Not only is the food fantastic and delicious but the customer service was above and beyond - when my 9 year old couldn't finish her noodles they not only made up a doggy bag but held onto it for us when we went to Wicked (as we weren't allowed to take it into the theatre?!?) so she had the fanciest packed lunch on Monday at school. Double delights! We will definitely visit again - i loved my bimbimbap dish and the calamari starters were perfecct.,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
767,AnnaG5,Lime Orange,5.0,"Great food, great value for money, great little gem!!!","I'm shocked that I have lived in this area for over 10 years and have only now discovered this wonderful local restaurant! It's conveniently located right next to Victoria Station, but unless you are visiting the Apollo theatre (right opposite) or are a commuter taking the bus outside the restaurant, it's easy to miss. Vauxhall Bridge Road certainly isn't the most scenic road, so probably not too many people just going for a stroll in the arae..However, I can only recommend taking a detour for this little gem.

All the dishes I have ordered so far have been excellent, I particularly liked their Japchae. Every day they have a different special lunch dish and for £3.99 take away or £4.99 eat-in it's incredible value for money. For London in general, but particularly for this area. Portions are generous!

It's casual dining at it's best. The furnishing may be simple, but the ambience feels relaxed and somehow always has a calming effect on me. Even when the restaurant is packed. This may also be thanks to the wonderful staff, always very friendly,quick and helpful.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
768,ongmich,Lime Orange,4.0,Great Korean food in London!,"The restaurant is conveniently located near to Victoria Station, just behind the Wicked Theatre. Nice restaurant ambience and great service staff! The food was also really good e.g. the bibimbap.

774,Geoff E,Lime Orange,4.0,Good food and got a seat straight away!,"I was taken here by a friend. We shared two starters. Both were excellent. I having never had Korean food I was unsure but this put me at ease. For mains we had be sizzling bowls of veg with an intact egg yoke. Mine also had chicken. This was filling and interesting. But not quite at the same level of yumminess but fully palatable and filling. Maybe owing to my own eating style by the end the food had blackened to the metal bowl and was less tasty. To be fair this was just the dregs so shouldn't put people off the food. For desert we had green tea ice cream... the taste of this was excellent. What was more questionable (and I think a marmite option) was the texture. It had green tea in it so was bitty. I am still undecided if I liked it. My friend definitely didn't. However two colleagues at work both said they love the bits! So I guess try and see its only a couple of quid.

I would come back, Korean food was tasty filly and fresh.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
775,PLeung8,Lime Orange,4.0,Very good Korean food,"We visited as a group of 4 adults and 4 children and found the service and food to be excellent. We didn't book as we turned up when it opened but by around 6 on a Thursday night it was very busy. Not sure if the staff were on different shift patterns, but the waiter was extremely busy on his own for the 1st hour which was OK for us as we was the first ones in so no issues with service.
Jap Chae (Glass noodles) was a bit small for £6.70 for a starter but it was very flavoursome.
Bimbibap was excellent and very tasty. BBQ meat was also very good and tasty. Lighting was a bit dark which meant sometimes it was a little hard to tell if the meat was cooked.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

I had expected similarity to Chinese food but I was very wrong.

The bibimbap I had was fantastic, 8 vegetables with egg yolk and chilli sauce, and the fun part was that you had to mix everything in to get the full flavour.

The staff were very friendly too, explaining all the best selling dishes and recommending a few to the kids who had no idea what they wanted.

Overall, a very pleasant experience.

796,winterbellaa,Lime Orange,4.0,Casual and Decent Korean Restaurant in SW area,"I came to know this restaurant after a series of research in narrowing down the best Korean restaurants that fits our criteria (including price range, location, atmosphere etc). I was a little sceptical at the beginning, as there weren't a lot of reviews on Tripadvisor for this place despite the high ratings. To be fair, Lime Orange isn't one of the most well-known Korean restaurants in town, but we like how it is one of the few that's close to my friend's hotel at South Kensington (as most Korean restaurants are gathered around Tottenham Court Road/Holborn area). The restaurant itself is very easy to find as it is located on the main road, right opposite Apollo Theatre (known as the theatre for Wicked the Musical). Price range is also very reasonable, and the quality of food is no less than that of the better known Korean restaurants (such as Kimchee). The portion of food is also very decent. For appetizers, we had jap chae (a small dish of Korean glass noodles, it was the best jap chae I had in London), vegetable mandu (5 Korean dumplings, they were very crispy) and a small bowl of kimchi (it was quite spicy, but it would be better if there was more depth in flavour rather than spice alone). For main course, we had a beef bibimbap, a kimchi soup pot (which actually gives you a complimentary bowl of rice, but it isn't specified on the menu. I quite like the pork that comes with it) and fried seafood udon (I like the flavours and the wide variety of seafood). Between the four of us, we had a really enjoyable meal as it was a nice casual place to dine and chat. The only downside for us is that the staff could have been a little bit more attentive by serving water regularly or perhaps just look around more often, otherwise everything was perfect. In general though, the staff there are all very friendly. On a final note, the bill came down to £40, which was 10 quid/pp. You definitely get more than you pay.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

799,Terry P,Lime Orange,4.0,Excellent location for the theatre,We had lunch in the restaurant which is right opposite the entrance to the Apollo Victoria theatre. The surrounds seem a bit basic but the food was tasty and the service excellent. Dishes are Japanese/Thai/Korean and the portions are generous.

801,Suzy2110,Lime Orange,4.0,Nice meal,"Nice meal in a great location. The food was presented well and was tasty. I had seafood pancakes for my starter- it was far too big a portion and would have filled me on its own! I did not finish it- the starter was tasty but a bit stodgy. I did not like the chili sauce they gave us to accompany the meal.

My main course was a pork dish served with rice and lettuce. This was tasty. Again, presentation was good.

A two course meal for two with one of us having sake and one of us having two bottled beers came in at around £40- for central London that's terrific value.

The restaurant is quite basic on the inside and the toilets were pretty shocking, they looked like they hadn't been cleaned for quite a while and there was a bit of a smell. That's my main reason for not giving a 5 star review.

It's not a posh restaurant but it was tasty, filling and service was good. Recommended if you're on a budget.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The service was faultless, the food (bibimbap etc) delicious (though the red chili paste was dispensed from what looked like a ketchup tomato bottle) and came to about £15/head for lunch. Would definately recommend.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

804,willy26,Lime Orange,4.0,Daily Specials and a bowl of kimchee = a good lunch for £8.20,"I have come here for lunch many times.

But haven't got past the three favourites
Monday daily special Chicken Katsu and Udon noodles
Wednesday Spicy beef soup, which is a chili-oil flecked consommé soup with bean sprouts, scallions, bits of beef and slices of a mild winter vegetable. I drown the accompanying bowl of rice in it.
Both go great with a side order of Kim Chee, the healthy cabbage and chili.
The total damage then is about £8.20.

They do Bibimbap very well. That works out at around £10. The Tofu option was my favourite they also do chicken, beef, pork or seafood. Only seafood untested, others fine too.
Service is quick and courteous. Place gets full though. Best advice is to arrive early, like 12 to 12.15. Solo diners have a stool and bar looking out of the window option. Place is near Victoria Station. Due to Crossrail civil engineering project, this area has become a bit of a food desert. Lime Orange is recommended.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

Although the restaurant is pretty small, narrow and pretty busy when we arrived, it still felt like we had enough room and could talk without needing to raise our voices over others.

The service was attentive, very polite and even though they were dealing with a busy pre-theatre crowd, we did not feel rushed at all. The menu is quite extensive, almost too much so, with Sushi, Chinese and other types of cuisine finding its way in but having not tried the more traditional Korean dishes before I went for a Bibimbap, which was excellent, even if I would usually prefer a slightly larger portion of chicken in it.

My wife had the Salmon and we shared a starter, which were both delicious and even when you include the drinks we still only paid £35. I would definitely come here again, regardless of going to the theatre or not.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We began with rice cakes and fish cakes in a sauce and squid which were nice but nothing special. We followed these with a pork and beef bibimbap. The highlight was the cucumber kimchee with pear. The cabbage kimchee was rather lacklustre. All in all probably good for the office workers nearby but not particularly relaxing. We drank a hite beer and a rice drink,"['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

816,Bethanie1606,Lime Orange,5.0,"Beautiful, authentic, Korean food.","I called up yesterday (Wednesday) morning and booked a table for 6pm as was seeing Billy Elliot in the theatre opposite. I booked this with an open mind and was blown away! It's a very small, intimate restaurant that appears to be family run. I had the japchae to start which was beautiful, even if I was the only person in the restaurant to eat with a fork! My partner had the deep fried prawns which were MASSIVE! They looked beautiful but our main meals came out before we'd finished our starters so I didn't get to try the prawns. For main I had the beef bibimbap. I am so glad I went with the crowd. This dish was DELICIOUS. Rice with egg, tasty beef, spinach, onions - absolutely delicious and fun because you get to mix the ingredients and add sauce to your tasting. My Partner had pork belly with lettuce (taco-style). He said his meat was a bit gristly but the flavours were really good, as were the dipping sauces. It is very fast service here which was great as within an hour we had a starter, main, beer, and sake. In total we spent £53 which is a little pricey but definitely worth it for a treat. The sake wine is delicious, as is the Asahi beer. The restaurant picked up in business by about 6.30/7 and had a really nice atmosphere to it. If I go to Victoria Palace Theatre again, I'll be sure to stop here to try something new!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

This was my third time eating in a Korean restaurant (first two in Paris) and I can tell that the food was as delicious and flavoured as in the other ones ate in. My only bad point, would be the Korean tea, I was expecting something more impressive, with more flavours. As for my friend, after having had a not so good experience with bibimbap in another korean restasuranrt, the one she ordered at Lime Orange (seafood bibimbap), completely changed her mind about Korean food (in a positive way :) ).

In that context, we were very happy to find Lime Orange. The fact that the restaurant was packed was encouraging, so we decided to dive in.
I really wanted to like the place, but left disappointed. The problem was that everything we had was desperately bland and lacking in taste. We started with the fried sweet and sour fried chicked. The sweet taste of the sauce decidedly overpowering any chicken that may have been there. Then came the seafood pajeon (korean pancake). It was very anticlimatic, and clearly undercooked. When this was pointed out, they took it back and brought another one after a while…which was not much better. We’ve had much tastier in other places (Asadal for example).
Then came the bibimbaps (we had pork and beef), which seemed to be what everyone comes for…
This too was so bland we almost cried. My girlfriend had to shower hers in chili sauce for her tastebuds to feel something…anything….
It was all just sad.
To Lime’s credit, the portions are generous and we did not leave hungry, nor did our evening break the bank.
Did we leave satisfied ? That’s another story….","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0
822,Kowk kin C,Lime Orange,5.0,The best meal in London,"Me and my familie went London for holiday and found this place by accident.
But it was the best meal we had in London...

London food not bad, but when you have deep fryed food and bread for 5 days in a row, it has a toll on your body.

Lime orange served real homey food full of flavour also big portions. The spices and ingredients used was great.
We will visit again if we are in London again!
Thank you.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The reviews on here and my friend made me expect more than it was.

We got a table (eventually) and they really rushed us through. They kept trying to get us to pay the bill but we were still talking - there wasn't anyone waiting for a table so I wasn't sure why they hurried us.

The food was nice. It was yummy and reasonable for £9 for a lunch.

841,bigusbirdus,Lime Orange,4.0,Great service and good!,"My friend and I both wanted something slightly different so we visited Lime Orange for lunch during the week. They offered a good value set lunch, 3 courses and a glass of wine for £17, but we were already eyeing up some of the different starters. My friend had been before and highly recommended it.

We had the fried kimchee tofu, spicy fried chicken to start and beef bimbimbap and pork belly bimbimbap. Along with some cold kimchee and miso to accompany the mains.

My friend asked for lettuce instead of rice and they were more than obliging. We finsish with a scoop each of the black sesame and green tea ice cream. Black sesame was a real treat. Ask for no topping!

It was fairly busy for during the week lunch service and the staff were lovely. Would come back again for sure!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

One of my colleagues got the beef Bulgogi special and said it was ""ok."" High marks for the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi, though.

I liked that the place wasn't too crowded even at 1PM and we could get a table right away.

The food was good and the prices reasonable. The only areas for improvement are to start taking credit cards (cash only) and make it easier to get the wait staff's attention.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
843,LanceSoup,Lime Orange,4.0,Authentic Korean with good service and reasonable prices,"I have eaten at Lime Orange a few times now over the last couple of years. As I am on business I normally dine alone. It is a small restaurant and most of the customers are Korean. The first thing that you notice is the attentive service. You are greeted and seated immediately you walk in by very polite, friendly staff. When you are ready to order a waiter or waitress appears straight away and if you look up because you need something else you are quickly attended to. The menu includes Korean favourites and, curiously, a sushi selection. The food is tasty and arrives very quickly. Wine is about the cheapest you will find in this part of London.

851,Iain H,Lime Orange,2.0,Pricey But Tastless Korean Food in Victoria,"A bulgogi salad to start was nice, but both the main courses (Beef babingka for mw wife and tofu bibingka for me) were tasteless as was the flavourless soup that accompanied the mains. We had two cups of Korean tea at £1.80 each and were surprised to find that there were no free refills. Also, in all Korean restaurants there are complimentary nibbles (kimchi, whitebait-like fish, etc). Here the kimchi was a pricey £2.00.

860,wwltstw,Lime Orange,1.0,Meh...,"My friend and I went to Lime Orange on a Friday evening for a pre-theatre meal. I was very excited about dining here due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Google. However, we left feeling disappointed and did not feel like we had our Korean food fix.

We started with the kimchi jeon (pancake), which was sickly sweet. The pancake was loaded with spring onions and very little kimchi. With the negligible amount of kimchi in the pancake, they might as well rename the dish 'spring onion pancake with traces of kimchi'. My friend and I joked about the chef mistaking sugar for salt.

My main was a seafood soup dish with rice. It was ok but nothing memorable; hardly any seafood, apart from the tiniest pieces of squid.

We ordered green tea ice cream for dessert. The ice cream was drizzled with lots of strawberry sauce. This was not described in the menu. They should have served it on the side. The sauce was super sweet. Fortunately, the waiter was happy to replace the ice cream, this time without the sauce. The ice cream itself, although very enticingly described in the menu, was not good at all. It wasn't smooth and had bits of ice in it. It tasted cheap.

Overall, very very disappointed. We went to Lime Orange with high expectations, but the food for us was unfortunately a bit meh...","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

Service was friendly and attentive, perhaps a touch too fast? Made me think the food was warmed up as it was delivered so quickly. Menu exciting and varied - both Japanese and Korean options and waiter advised on how to choose and select options. Unfortunately I must have chosen a duff off the menu as my Katsu Chicken Udon was far noodles with some deep friend chicken on it. The 'special sauce ' accompanying it was - I swear - Hp brown sauce. Still Udon noodles were tasty. Perhaps I just choose the wrong food but rest of table said things were nice but not great. Unfortunately I think it's a case of a restaurant getting away with serving poor food to a tourist market (it's right near Wicked and Billy Elliot). Touch too expensive for what we got.

I was very impressed.

Unfortunately, the food was cold by the time we brought it back to the office (we're not very far from the restaurant either) but it tasted great. Given the portion size and that it's only £4 for the special, I'd definitely go back and try another special of the day again.

If you happen to be working around the area, it's very close to the station and you probably have to wait about as long as queuing up to pay for a sandwich at Pret. I would definitely recommend it and I will be visiting again very soon.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

It was absolutely delicious and we both thoroughly enjoyed out meals. We each had a beer as well.

The noodles were lukewarm and tasteless. We ordered seafood and vegetables, but the only vegetables were a few peppers and onions.
The staff paid very little attention to us, although when asked whether we'd enjoyed our meal and told it was not very hot, said they would have heated and took the service charge off our bill.

876,bimbariccia,Lime Orange,5.0,What a find!,"We had no idea what to expect when we went to Lime Orange with friends the other night. From the outside it looks rather unremarkable but we were greeted very warmly by the staff. Inside the decor was simple and the atmosphere welcoming.

The menu is quite extensive and we didn't really know where to begin. Thankfully someone in our party who had been there before ordered for us and we were treated to some truly delicious dishes.

The Japchae (sweet potato noodles) and Beef bulgogi were particular favourites with us but everything we tasted was truly delicious and, quite importantly, not over-salted. Portions were super generous and we could have probably ordered less than we did, but we're grateful we got to try so much.

Next time I think we'll go for two rounds of Japchae, the beef Bibimbap (which is a comforting big stone pot of rice with meat, veg and a raw egg yolk which cooks in the heat of the pot) and the Beef Bulgogi.

It's not super cheap but it's good value for the size of the portions and the overall quality.

We can't wait to go back!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

878,KMMC,Lime Orange,5.0,Hidden Gem,"I have eaten here twice in the last month. The first time was in a group of 6 before seeing Billy Elliot. The waiter was very patient with us explaining the menu & happily explaining what everyone else was eating as we were looking around. He recommended the Kimchee Jeon as a starter which was delicious. The tempura was plentiful. I'm a vegetarian and had the hot stone pot Tofu Bibimbap. This is a bowl of rice, vegetables and tofu. There is a raw egg yolk on the top that cooks as you mix it all in with chilli sauce (you do this yourself so choose how spicy you want it!). It was delicious!

The second time I took my God-daughter as we were seeing Wicked. It's literally over teh road. I had the same again (it was so delicious first time around) and she had the fish Bobimbap - there was plenty of different types of fish and she loved it. Once again brilliant service and delicious food.

Some advice definitely call up and book in advance. It's so busy and popular. We booked both times, lots of disappointed people or people who had to wait. It's quite small so there's not lots of room to wait in. Also they prefer cash - they do take cards.

So I highly recommend it, great food, service and atmosphere plus it's so close to both shows.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

882,J_fleur84,Lime Orange,4.0,A Korean feast,"This is the first time I’ve visited the restaurant and wasn’t disappointed. It’s a fairly small restaurant and as we went there early on a Tuesday we didn’t have an issue getting a table. The restaurant is a stones throw from the entrance of Victoria Station, so nearby for the Apollo theatre.

The waiters were helpful and showed my friend how best to eat her dish, and also added advice as to how to make mine taste the best. The advice was gratefully received! I went for the tofu bibbimap (?) which was very tasty and it was nice not to have plain tofu!

The dishes were also reasonably priced, along with the beer too.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
883,Ggirl78,Lime Orange,5.0,Fantastic first time korean experience,"My Daughter and I visted Lime Orange pre-theatre after I saw the good reviews on tripadvisor. Im glad to say we were not disappointed, the restaurant is small but despite there being a lot of diners it didnt feel crowded. The waiter who served us was friendly and welcoming offering tips on the food.

The food was amazing, I had seafood Bibimbap which was delicious packed with flavour and came with chilli sauce to add to taste, my Daughter had Katsu Udon Noodles which we both agreed was the best katsu we had tasted and there was plenty of it. The prices were really reasonable too, approx 8 - 10 for a main meal and soft drinks a bargain at £1.50.

Our new years resolution is now to learn how to use chop sticks as we were too embarrassed to ask for a fork !

Thank you for a lovely dining experience which was one of the highlights of our trip.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

But a friend took me and assured me it was delicious. The staff were friendly and gave lots of useful information about the dishes. The menu was varied, quality was great. I opted for chicken bibimbap which was fun and tasty. The prices are really good, especially considering the central location. I'll certainly be going back!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
885,Stevie B,Lime Orange,4.0,Great Korean food,"This restaurant is tucked behind ""Wicked "" the show in Victoria. I had the King prawns for starters that were cooked in a tempura batter, they were huge and delicious. For main I had the chicken biibimbap which was absolutely lovely, very flavoursome. Very reasonable prices, the staff were attentive but not too much, thankfully. I cannot recommend this little restaurant highly enough. if you want good, tasty Korean food this is the place for you. Probably best to book first as it gets very busy.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

Highly recommended","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
887,EmelieHzb,Lime Orange,5.0,Best Korean in London!,"We've been to Lime Orange 3 times, and we always leave very satisfied! The bibimbap is delicious and very filling. But the highlight of this restaurant is probably the Korean Barbecue! You can chose to grill your meat yourself, which is a very fun experience. All the bulgogi meats are tender and full of flavour. The kimchee pancake as a starter is superb, as is the black sesame ice cream for dessert!
On top of delicious and fresh food, the staff is great and friendly. We only have great things to say about this place - there is definitely no need to go to more expensive or busy Korean restaurants in Soho!!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
888,MrVilliers,Lime Orange,4.0,Excellent last minute lunch choice,"Friends at work had suggested somewhere else to support as part of the AmEx Shop Small campaign, but then I found this place and we managed to book a table.

We arrived and the place had a queue, which is always a good sign. We were seated at our table and given menus to begin analysing. There may be a lot of there but it all sounds great and judging by the food we all received, it's all done to a decent standard. We tried a range of dishes, including the Raw Beef Bibimbap, Chicken Katsu Udon, Salmon Teriyaki and Yukgae Jang, and teverything we had was bursting with flavour and well prepared. This is good Korean food, with plenty of options to include everyone (now also very curious about their sushi too)

The prices are reasonable and the staff are very friendly. It's quite a small restaurant and they do recommend on their website to book in advance. Having seen how busy it gets, I would definitely agree.
We all agreed, we would definitely be back.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
889,Paul S,Lime Orange,5.0,"First rate but inexpensive, attracts repeat trade.","This place is not expensive, but very high quality - there seem to be a lot of Koreans who eat there, and many people who are repeat trade dropping in for a very quick meal.. The classic Korean dish bibimbap was fantastic, and seems to be especially popular, but it's a very large portion for one. The wine was great too. We'll definitely be going back. It's very easy to get to - very near to Victoria station.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
890,Stephen B,Lime Orange,4.0,Authentic Asian food,Ideally located for Victoria's theatres. The food is plentiful for the price and really authentic and tasty.

891,SK8,Lime Orange,4.0,Very tasty,"Popped in for an early dinner before a gig and to sample our first taste of Korean food. We were not disappointed! There was plenty to chose from on the menu and the staff were happy to advise choices to our taste. We shared some chicken dumplings to start which were lovely. I had the pork bulgogi which was really, REALLY good! I had it with lettuce and rice as advised (and costs extra); you wrap it and eat with your hands - yum. It was a big portion and I thought the rice was unnecessary - but the lettuce was a nice fresh way to serve and enjoy the pork and I might try it at home. The other half had katsu chicken with udon noodles - it was also really tasty and a good generous portion. We were both chuffed, especially as he works a stones' throw and will be able to pop in and enjoy the lunchtime specials. Location is very convenient for Victoria, just a 2 minute walk, behind the Apollo theatre.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

It doesn't look much but don't be fooled. We booked for 5pm, when they open and for first 15mins we were the only ones there but it soon started to fill up so booking is a must. The waiter was attentive & helpful but not intrusive, recommending dishes etc. The food was lovely and very tasty and it was very filling. I thought the prices were reasonable, 2 starters, 2 main courses, 3 sides, 2 puddings, large glass of wine, coke & bottle of water was £55 inc service charge.

Dinner was absolutely lovely and we had a great time chatting even after finishing our meal. We stayed in Lime Orange until all other diners have left. We left the restaurant at 10:50pm and then we noticed the closing time was 10:30pm!! How kind was the staff not to patronise us regarding the closing hour.

The food was tasty and good. We also ordered Beef Bibimbap and Beef Bulgogi. The waiter recommended lettuce and rice with the Beef Bulgogi and neglected to mention there was an extra charge for both the rice and the lettuce. There was also a 10% service charge added to the bill. I suggested he add a statement to the menu noting the extra charge for the rice and the lettuce. He good naturedly removed the excess charges. The 10% service charge was not amended and no record of our meal was provided following our cash payment.

The first time I thought the food was pretty good, especially the starter of spicy calamari. My main of beef bulgogi was a bit too salty, and didn't come with any lettuce.

My second visit was a few weeks later. Again I ordered the spicy calamari, which was pretty good. But this time I went for the beef bibimbap, and found it very bland.

Also both times the service wasn't very good. I waited a very long time both times before anyone came to take our orders. Also one of the times we were running late by about 10 minutes. As we were on the tube we didn't have signal to ring ahead and let them know. As we arrived, the waitress very sacasrtically said ""we're a bit late aren't you"". I wasn't impressed.

I don't think I'll be returning here, as there are many better korean restaurants in central London.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0
905,Bernardinho9,Lime Orange,5.0,Authentic Korean Food at it's Best!,"I popped in for a quick post work feed. The staff were friendly and helpful. The atmosphere unpretentious and relaxed.

The food most importantly was brilliant! I had the calamari (some of the best I have had). The Kimchee, which is not to everyone's taste, but worth a try. Then the bibimbap... Which was incredibly tasty. Great value, service and food. Perfect for a quick feed before a late train from Victoria.

Enjoy!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
906,MrSiv,Lime Orange,4.0,A work night out with a difference..,"My colleagues and I found ourselves in SW1 for an evening before a trade show and all agreed we should try something different. Being a tripadviser geek nowadays, I took charge and came across Lime Orange. With positive reviews and nobody being overly au fait with Korean food it was decided that Lime Orange would be the place for us!

Despite some recent, rather derogatory reviews I'm pleased to say that our experience was a overall a positive one.

The restaurant itself is pretty basic but clean and welcoming, which is unfortunately not a given late'ish on a Tuesday night in London.

The staff were friendly and accommodating at the beginning. Having not tried Korean before our likes and dislikes were taken into account before recommendations were offered for starters and mains.

But after that I would have to say that service was average at best. Although the food service was rather slow, especially considering we were one of four tables in that evening, I would never complain when the food is as good as it was. However, we did outline upon arrival (at 8.30pm) that our colleague needed to leave at 9.45pm for a conference call but come 9.40pm he still didn't have his main meal. Not a problem normally but our circumstances meant this caused quite the issue.

What irked me the most was the general service, which was a shame after such a positive start. In between serving and going to kitchen the staff stood with their back to the restaurant chatting among themselves by the till. This made it nigh on impossible to place a drinks order and it took me leaning across into their conversation to get their attention for the water we had ordered 10 minutes earlier.

The restaurant bills itself as Korean BBQ and there are even gas grills built into some of the tables. Our table had one but the only downer of taking the recommendations were that none of our dishes incorporated a BBQ element, which in hindsight seemed odd and an opportunity missed by the staff.

Service aside it must said the food was very, very good. Everything was fresh, tasty and the we all thoroughly enjoyed every dish we shared from the pickled beansprouts, vegetable dumplings, extremely refreshing cucumber dish to the lemon chicken, noodles and beef - to name but a few....I think we over ordered somewhat.

Another big bonus was the price. 4 people, multiple bottles of beer, wine, two courses each and sharing sides all came in at a very reasonable price of around £20 per head.

These two final points are the reason I have bumped this up from Average to Very Good. Poor service can easily be corrected and can be down to the individuals on the night but food of this quality at this price deserves to be shouted about.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0
907,Julie J,Lime Orange,1.0,Absolute rubbish Food and service,"We ordered Beef Bulgogi which the menu said it had fruits in it. It came just with fried beef and a few pieces of capsicum in it for £9.20. The food gave me a tummy ache after that. The service was appalling. The guy at the counter was on his phone, without a care in the world. He was quite smelly as well.

I will never go that way in my life again. Absolute rip off. I'm sorry to write this, but it was rubbish and waste of money. I don't know how people are putting good reviews on this.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",0

I had a kimchee pancake and chicken bibimbap. Both were brilliant in taste, texture and flavour. Simply delicious. I wasn't even hugely hungry but I somehow managed to finish the entire bibimbap which was quite large! The prices are also reasonable given the central London location.

912,GeordiesNewcastle,Lime Orange,2.0,Dont waste your money,"We booked this restaurant based on all the positive reviews, unfortunately we found nothing positive about the food! We ordered the Rib Eye steak and Salmon Teriyaki from the Grill section. As you don't get anything with either dish we both ordered a bowl of sticky rice each. The Steak was tiny, overcooked and fatty and the rice was just plain nothing to write home about. Although the salmon was a good size it just tasted burnt and was in a pool of soy sauce .Overall the food was very disappointing, the staff were not very helpful, it was a big disapointment after all the good reviews it got.

I would have given 5 stars except my beer came in a dirty glass and the service while not bad, could have been a little better. The young waiter was helpful, keen and took time to explain the dishes. We were served by two staff so the quality varied from ok to very good.

We were served by 3 different people, with the main waitress not talking to us at all when the dishes were delivered or removed the plates. We asked for a glass of water to accompany the other drinks we ordered and was given warm tap water with no ice, we were not offered mineral water.

When asked for recommendation, he was able to suggest a few dishes which were very much enjoyable. We had seafood pancake, kimchi hot pot and beef bibimbap -- simple comfort food which made such a wonderful dining experience for us.

922,Nancy L,Lime Orange,2.0,THE LADY WHO TELLS YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR FOOD.,"I don't normally write reviews but it just has to be done. The lady who owns the restaurant needs to stop telling us when and how we put Siracha on our bibimbaps. How we should be doing with the food we are eating.

It has been occasions where she has purposely took hold of the siracha and has put it all over my sister's food to the point she found it too spicy. If she is reading it, YOU NEED TO KNOW WHEN TO LET PEOPLE DO WHAT THE HELL THEY LIKE WITH THE FOOD THEY ARE PAYING FOR. You may not like it but hell we are the ones paying to eat there.

I won't be going there because of another attempt of eating there, she has tried to smother my food with Siracha when I told her NO.

I had Pajeon and Bibimbap, Pajeon was crispy and lots of seafoods are mixed too, though my Korean friend told that they already prepared it a while ago and reheated (re-panfried) again now, which you never know... at least for me it was crispy and nice :-) Stone-bowl of Bibimbap was well heated so that you have a little bit of burnt rice that I really appreciate.

Try the Korean ricewine Makgeolli: cool and milky. The service was very friendly and attentive. The kid's special wishes and dietary changes were gladly accepted. We will for sure come again.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
937,Charles R,Lime Orange,3.0,Convenient kimchi pre-theatre,"If you are seeking a quick and reasonably priced bibimbap or Korean BBQ before taking the family to Wicked or Billy Elliott, then look no further. This straight forward establishment is run very authentically by a husband and wife team.

Value for money and authenticity, this place is a good option with no immediate competition in this part of London. For aficionados, you might find the pajun a tad bit tired looking. Asadal near Holborn has nicer decor and better barbecue but this place is good if you're yearning for kimchi in this part of town.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The only downside was that one of the two waitresses had to take a break or something and one waitress being alone in a well visited place was not good. We had to wait a little to get our check but it wasn't that big of a problem.
Also, as usual with Asian restaurants, food marked as non-spicy isn't necessarily completely non-spicy so be sure to ask the staff before ordering","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

942,ste451,Lime Orange,4.0,First try of Korean food!,"myself and my wife attended the restaurant prior to a trip to see Wicked, Lime Orange is directly opposite the theatre so perfect to eat beforehand.
When we arrived it was around 5pm and the place was empty but after reading the positive reviews we went in.
There was a very pleasant male staff member in charge, we ordered starters and mains, we both had the Bibimbap for our main meals which is an authentic korean dish that comes in a sizzling dish and has lot of various ingredients......and an egg yolk, the waiter explained that you add chilli sauce and mix it all up yourself, it was absolutely delicious!

my only slight complaint is that the main meals arrived whilst we were still eating our starters (and we are by no means slow eaters!) but in fairness this my be a bit of a cultural difference and it didn't cause us any problems, (especially for the fact that the Bibimbap came in a red hot dish so retained its heat)

The overall price including some drinks was £43 which i thought very good value for central London.

We will definitely return on our next trip to London.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

To our surprise, it was really good. The korean fried rice was really good and spicy enough (for asians who love extra spiciness). Had another dish with 4 types of meat (can't remember what the dish is called) but it was really tasty as well. The meats were well-marinated.

The only thing I really hate about it is the horrible lighting, it was difficult to eat in the extremely orange lights. Aside from that, I'd totally recommend it! :)","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

We were there pretty early, about 17:30, and we were seated directly. Service was very nice the whole time. We had one of the set menues and some sake. All courses was perfect and you won't leave Lime Orange hungry 'cos you get big portions. It is in my opinion not pricey, especially not considering the quality of the food.

Came back on a Tuesday and had the kimchi fried rice. It was good but not as good as the bibimbap. My favorite part about Korean food is the banchan, so on the second visit i ordered the mixed banchan (called something else on the menu) and it came with pickled bean sprouts, radish, cucumber and the green spinach-like vegetable. It was not was I was used to. What I typically love was not done right, so skip this. The cucumber was extremely vinegary and sweet, inedible. The greens and bean sprouts were ok. So my suggestion so far is to stick with the bibimbap. I'll go back again for that!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
952,Emma M,Lime Orange,5.0,Great location for pre theatre meal,"Hadn't tried Korean food before so this was a pleasant surprise.

We were going to see Wicked and chanced upon this restaurant. It was clean and all staff were polite and friendly.

We like to try out different cuisines so gave Lime Orange a go based on reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. This restaurant is at the 'unfashionable' end of Vauxhall Bridge Road and looks uninspiring from the outside. Step inside and it looks like a cafe, no scenic views from the window. But, the service is flawless, the food great and If you are new to this, they will advise you. Terrific fresh food, served quickly, great prices. Loved it !!","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
954,Mitzi-pie,Lime Orange,5.0,So yummy!,"I visited here on a Saturday afternoon, with three others.

We all chose from the Korean menu items, with two of us having a Bibimap - an iron couldron like bowl arrived with the prepared ingredients (in my case: chicken, rice vegetables and pickled cabbage) neatly arranged, we were given chilli sauce to pour over and then mix everything together. (I really want to find an excuse to visit again so I can have another!)
The Bibimap continues to cook in front of you, so the flavour and texture developed throughout the meal. Each dish was flavoured brilliantly and tasted fresh.

While we went on a Saturday lunchtime, we didnt take advantage of the lunchtime offer as wanted to choose items from the main menu. I thought the food was priced reasonably and I noted that there were some set meals starting from about £15- which included a small gass of house wine.

I definately recommend, a great eat and so conveniently placed right by Victoria Station, The Apollo and Victoria Place Theatres.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1
955,Mx247,Lime Orange,5.0,Absolutely loved this place!,"We discovered this place while looking for a place from where we could grab a bite to eat before watching the wonderful musical called 'Wicked'. That's how we discovered Lime Orange. Lovely modern decor inside, really fast wireless Internet, service with a smile and really really great Chicken Katsu Udon. I am a huge fan of Udon noodles and rarely manage to find a place that makes them just so. Needless to say I fell for this place and went right back the next day even though we weren't going to watch a musical afterwards.

The staff at Lime Orange assured us that we could dine in and make it on time to the show, and even helped us choose items on the menu that were both good and quick to make.

The food was very good and the atmosphere was also very welcoming. there were tables all the way out till the entrance door which made them very chilly. Personally I would suggested eating at a table half way or all the way in.","['bibimbap', 'pajeon']",1

The waiter explained the menu and made some recommendations on ordering the lettuce to wrap around the meat which was very helpful as this was our first experience of Korean food. The food was excellent, well cooked and tasty although I would have welcomed a gap between our starters and main course, which arrived before we'd finished eating.

We've been curious for a while about North Korea, and visiting this restaurant seemed like a cheaper and safer option than traveling to Pyongyang. We especially went for the show. However, we were disappointed as there was no show that day. The waitress could barely speak a few words of English, but we understood they're not performing anymore. Such a pity.

About the food, it was actually really good. We ordered kimchi, rice with kimchi, cold noodle soup and some shrimps with vegetables (that turned out to be SUPER spicy, be aware they do like their spicy food there), 1 bottle of water and two beers, all for 78 dollars. Service was fast and apart from the uneatable spicy shrimps, everything was delicious. Waitress are kind of weird, but I felt this is because they can't speak English, you can see they want to interact but they just don't have the language skills.

Overall an interesting experience. Just the idea of meeting someone from North Korea is interesting. In the end, you'll hardly cross one of the street.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1

No singing-dancing show was featured this particular evening and staff lacked sufficient communication skills outside Korean or Chinese. Kim Bap, Bibimbap and Kimchi were of excellent quality and very reasonably priced, however the Korean beer was grossly overpriced (i.e. a single 500 ml bottle costing more than most individual dishes).

The waitresses are pretty and talented. They serve food and in between they performed on stage from singing to dancing to even playing musical instruments!

It was colorful, lively n have a mix of traditional n new items. Watch out for the solo drum performance- my favorite. It was amazing to watch how the waitresses continue to serve whilst in between their costume changes. Pricing is relatively high for Phnom Penh standard but worthwhile for the experience.

977,Yitzhak_Khoo,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,A peek into La La Land.,"I heard and read quite a few reviews about the restaurant, and I finally dropped by with a few friends while in town.

The restaurant was laid out like a typical Chinese restaurant with a stage. The waitresses wore light Hanbok (korean dress) and took orders mostly in slightly accented Mandarin. Our waitress eyed us ratherly suspiciously when we spoke in English. The menu was filled with an amalgamation of Korean and Chinese food, with the odd dog stew (unordered thus unsampled). I would say most items are overpriced in this place, but you probably already guessed it.

Still, the kimchi pancakes and seafood omelette were surprisingly tasty. We had a plate of stir-fried intestines which was delicious but chewier than old tires. Slightly disappointed by the lack of North Korean beer - we had South Korean Soju instead (fancy that).

The main highlight starts around 730-ish after the first few plates were served. The waitresses gave a warm up song and dance, distributed bouquets of plastic flowers to each table (Hell, I thought I was given one for being cute). A chubby girl sat behind the drums and delivered a heart-thumping solo. There were dances in traditional costumes; look out for the thin but dazzlingly beautiful girl who is the designated ""spinner"", her part of the dances include several whirling solo (think of a female whirling dervish you would propose marriage to, in a heartbeat)

Dragging on into the early evening, you would sample 60s karaoke korean songs (imagine very tamely-dressed Korean pop groups), a saxophone solo of ""The moon represents my heart"" by another gorgeous girl, and some more song and dances with electric guitars (we caught one girl finger-syncing to the music) and accordion (the national musical instrument for DPRK).

Overall the night was enjoyable; the food was great and the performance, enjoyable.
And although photography is forbidden during the performance, you can still take a shot with the waitress before you leave.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1

There will be two kind of cold sweet potato noodle.
One is with cool water ( with some sources ) and the other do not have cool water.
I tried cool water style. And, may be without water will be hot and spicy. And, my explanation is just for your reference.

But, fried rice with kimchi and egg was a bit hot and spicy. It was usual taste like in South Korea. It was not my taste. :)

Staffs ( from Pyeongyang ) was beautiful and kind. They served whole time while we finish lunch. And, I tried not to mention about political issues.

979,travellerL6484AW,Pyongyang Restaurant,5.0,"More expensive than restaurants around, but still a great value.","I went there because it would be one of very few opportunities to meet a North Korean. While some others have commented that they felt ignored and felt that it might have been because they were from Western countries, I did not feel that way. I felt they were quite friendly, especially considering that the place was full and only a handful of girls had to run the entertainment, change costumes repeatedly, and act as waitresses. The girl who played the yanggeum (Korean dulcimer) and the girl who played the drums were amazing. If you consider that all the girls could speak Korean, Chinese, and at least a little bit of English, and could dance and play instrumetns and wait tables well, it is truly amazing. I was given a bouquet of flowers used during the show at the end by one of the girls (although I wasn't able to take it home). I have spent a lot of time in South Korea and in Asia in general and I can speak Chinese, so maybe I felt less culture shock in general and was able to understand some of what they were saying with other customers. They could speak English also, some more than others, but that was ok, because if one could not understand or respond well, she could get another. The restaurant is connected to the North Korean government from what I have read, the girls might come from elite families, the politics might be distatsteful, but a stand alone review should give it a very high rating. The girls were very remarkably talented and were friendly, the bibimbap was terrific. The hors d'ouevres were not remarkable, but I can't think of any time in my life where I got a show, a meal, and a cultural experience for 15 dollars including a glass of ginseng wine.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1

I usually am not a huge fan of Korean food, but there were several things on the menu I was surprised I really liked.

The waitresses are a bit standoffish with westerners, and they seated us in back, but one did come over to chat briefly (and probably see what our deal was).

The prices are higher than in Cambodia, we wound up paying $18 per person (we were six people) but we had a lot of beer and way more food than we could eat. Then again, they don't charge admission, so the price includes the performance.

We were the only caucasian people there - and it was almost a full audience. Mostly korean men consuming alot of alcohol and smoking. That alone was good entertainment.

Apparently the waitresses/entertainment are from North Korea and live on the premises and are not allowed to leave. It's an odd atmosphere. Entertainment starts at 7.30 and is excellent!

Definately worth seeing; it's not advertised in the city - it's by word of mouth that you come across it or by hearing about it from a local.

Felt very safe there - dinner was 55.00 for 3 of us including 6 beer, however we chose veggie dishes . (Some dishes eg. Eel was 35.00...).

The young ladies are extremely talented musicians and dancers and they pretty and nice. They may struggle with communication as they do not speak English. I spoke to them in my limited Mandarin.

The menu is extensive but many people make the mistake of ordering Chinese dishes. This mistake will negatively color your experience. My recommendation: order a large bowl of very special cold Pyongyang noodles (one per person as these are not sharable) and the kim chee. You will not be disappointed and you will feel that the meal and entertainment were a tremendous value. This is one of those extremely delicious meals I can still taste and dream of having again...","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
989,Moonshadower,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,North Korean Fantasy Feast,"If you have a spare evening in Phnom Penh don't miss a visit to North Korea! This unusual restaurant serves Korean favorites followed by a vivid floorshow.

Operated by a department of the North Korean regime, the restaurant provides a source of hard currency, a venue for propaganda and possibly more nefarious activities that benefit the DPRK.

The large banqueting hall is brightly illuminated and decorated in what might be described as ""synthetic wedding party"".

The food, conveniently pictured in a photo menu, was abundant, savory, and featured barnyard, sea and kennel-to-table (yes, dog meat) Korean favorites. Service, provided by attractive young women who also perform, was pleasant and fast, a necessity considering the imminent start of the show.

The fifty minute floorshow featured most of the all-female wait staff singing, dancing and expertly performing on a wide variety of traditional and modern instruments with an ear singeing, over-amped audio output.

Most of the guests in this busy eatery were Korean men, but Westerners and some families were in attendance. Communication with the staff is challenging absent Korean or Khmer, and one needs to accept the presence of smokers, ""minders"" and surveillance. Was that a camera overhead in the women's toilet?","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
990,MrBrant,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Dining and entertainment,Good selection of more exotic dishes like turtle and chicken soup and roast cow's tongue. Then at 7:30pm the lights go down and there is a musical dancing extravaganza that the glorious leader would be proud of.,"['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
991,Fatcat78,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,Unique taste n experience for North Korea food and performance,"Cold ramen is tasty, a lil different than what I had in Seoul. Bbq pork was ok.

Worth visiting if you have time.

Performance was ok.

Most of the attendees were men.

Service wise was so so. Waitress only able to chat after performance finished. Some can speak Mandarin too.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
992,504RichS,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Interesting experience,"Being a South Korean living in America, I was a bit hesitant to eat here, but my wife insisted. It was my first time meeting North Koreans and it was equally unnerving and exciting at the same time. They don't speak English so we ordered in Korean (they speak much differently than South Koreans, but it's understandable). The cold noodle soup (they call it ""rengmyun"") was really good and made the authentic old-fashioned way without any artificial ingredients liks MSG. They asked us about life in America and once my wife got to talking, they wouldn't leave our tableside. In fact, 2 of them stayed by our table for the entire meal, which gave me a bit of indigestion. They were obviously curious. In the end, it was a unique experience that I couldn't have at home and that was worth the price (which is more typical of what you'd pay in America for this kind of meal).

As we were there for lunch, we did not get to see the live show, but I hear it's pretty good. We did hear a couple of the servers practicing their songs for later that evening and it was awkwardly entertaining.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
993,timpys,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,North Korean Banquet Call Experience with Entertainment.,"We joke about going to this place and having stone stoup and rice husk gravel as a starving North Korean. Its a bright an airy room staffed with young NK women who are clearly living a better life than at at home. Don't think for a minute that this a social enterprise, just a way for the NK gov't to get some exposure and money. Food was plentiful and well-prepared, if you like vats of kimchee with everything. Each of the serving staff participated in the show, which ranged from surreal to cheesy to actually ok (the Korean zither player).","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
994,secretgardenkohrong,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,A bizarre experience,"This restaurant isn't somewhere you'd go particularly for the food. It's really all about the experience. It's more of a bizarre banquet hall with live shows every night, alternating between rock shows and traditional dancing. Enjoying a beer while watching a 20 year old North Korean girl rocking out to a manic drum solo is priceless. Also priceless is trying to convince the staff, who are all the chosen few who get to leave North Korea for the green pastures of Cambodia, that they should pop to an internet cafe on their lunch break and explore the wonderful world of google.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
995,RobinL2025,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,mashikesumnida!,"Typical N.Korean food, including cold noodles. Great place if you want to see a bit of North Korea. However, the show had a bit too much chinese songs compare to korean ones.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
996,341jeans,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,Strangest experience in Cambodia,"we read the reviews and thought this would be an interesting experience, well it certainly was!
We arrived early as advised and there was no one else there, 4 waitresses came over with menus, and stood around us waiting for our order. None of them seemed to speak English, and watched over us for a good 20 mins, while we tried to work out the menu, lots of variety but prices quite high.
A lot of large groups started to arrive, and we got our food before the floor show began.food was nothing special, but the show was quite good.
Seemed to be a lot of business men there leering at the waitresses, and lots of smokers.
Probably wouldn't bother going again, there's plenty of better restaurants to visit in Town.
Also when we got the bill there was no card facilities, luckily we had enough cash on hand to pay!","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",0
997,Jim M,Pyongyang Restaurant,4.0,Birthday,I took four friends to Pyongyang Restaurant for a birthday celebration and we had a great time. The food was spicy and good and the show was excellent. The women are talented and put on a great musical. It was my friend's birthday and the waitresses led all the patrons in Happy Birthday and have him flowers. It was a great evening and worth the money.,"['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
998,Cowpaper,Pyongyang Restaurant,3.0,Interesting ... but not great.,"Went here for dinner hoping it was the night they also did the performances but alas, no show on a Tuesday night.

Atmosphere was filled will smoke and and mirrors. Literally, mirrors all over the walls and everyone smoking, so if that's your thing you're in for a treat.

Food was good, though I admit I played it safe and got a noodle dish (the waitress brought over a phone book sized menu then stood right next to me while I perused it. Under pressure! Lolz)

I would go back if I were sure to catch the performance but otherwise, take a pass.","['mulnaengmyeon', 'bibimnaengmyeon']",1
