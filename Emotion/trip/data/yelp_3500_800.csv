0,3500,4021,lfZVgo5FHISUoZHeFHsmbw,Bonchon - Pineville,5,"Never had Korean style fried chicken before. We ordered a combo chicken with half and half spice. The wings definitely have better flavor as the drums were not very seasoned (if at all) besides the batter on the outside. The lunch portion was very big. We also ordered the japchae. It was well seasoned and tasty but very little bulgogi which was disappointing. Lastly, we ordered a spicy mayo to go with the fries but it wasn't in our to go bag. We were charged for it, so make sure you check your takeout before leaving.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",0

The chicken was nice and crunchy and had the perfect amount of sauce, and they were spicy! A nice plus since I really enjoy spicy food. My family and I ordered a few appetizers, wings, and one entree and it was definitely enough for all us. Out of the appetizers I recommend getting the potstickers half and half, they're a nice treat!","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1

3,3503,4024,39NsjsmB0WGjTMmOwK1Qug,Bonchon - Pineville,4,Tried it here today for an afternoon snack.  Got the signature fried chicken with picked radishes.  I had the combo with drums and wings and chose 1/2 and 1/2 on the sauces.  The garlic soy was so amazing.  The spicy was really spicy. I like spicy food and for fried chicken it was more spicy than I liked.  I figured I would not like the picked radishes but the server recommended then and they were nice.  They have beer and wine and the place was much nicer than I expected.  Will definitely go back soon.  That shopping center is turning into a great place for many casual dining places.,"['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1

I didn't know what I wanted when we ordered because they had us order in less than one minute after we sat down and got the menus. Then my sister gets a salad as everyone gets a lot of wings. I wait till they come back to check if we were doing good and I order the Chicken Katsu without the mayo. She says that is good and leaves to go start making the Katsu, or so I thought. And just to be stated there was a group about to leave and another looking at the menu. We wait till after everyone else is almost done eating, roughely 15 to 20 minutes later, when someone else comes up to our table. We make sure that they got my order and they say that they didn't. So I then tell him my order again buffet he leaves before I get to say that I wouldn't like mayo. He still doesn't have the cooks start to make my meal. Sooner after he comes back to the tables, roughely 5 minutes later, and he asks to make sure he has the right order, now he stays for the whole order. He then leaves, now starting to make my meal. Now my sister starts eating a few peanut butter crackers because her salad was not much food and she accidentally drops one on the ground, they  don't offer to help but instead stand at the counter and  laugh at her. When about 10 more minutes till the Katsu finally gets to the table. It doesn't even taste that good and is all ready cold. So overall THIS PLACR IS MUCH OVER RATED!","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",0
5,3505,4026,7t6vIgNqfe_lB8G4PyYpXg,Bonchon - Pineville,4,Was so expecting to like it after hearing radio commercials for a month claiming how good their award winning chicken wings are.  Great service by Phoebe. Great looking restaurant with inside and patio seating.  Now the down side.  We started with fried calamari - batter was very thick and calamari very chewy.  Bland taste with no dipping sauces.  My son had popcorn chicken that looked like they just took everything from the bottom of the deep fryer and put it on a plate.  I had Chicken Katsu with again a very thick batter/coating.  I've had Chicken Katsu at many other Korean Restaurants around the country and Katsu traditionally has a very thin fried coating.  We might try again with just carry out for those 'award winning wings',"['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1

It was really crispy, as it should be, and the sauce was great. They weren't joking when they said SPICY. My father had the glass noodle dish with vegetables. I didn't like it personally because of the sesame oil but if that's your thing, go ahead. Service was great, restaurant was clean, recommend to anyone looking for some good fried chicken.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1

We ordered the fried chicken ( half & half to try both flavors) and the korean tacos. I'm usually a picky eater so Im always removing something from a dish, but I felt adventurous. I didn't remove the slaw from the tacos. No regrets! The tacos are good and one of the lower calorie items on the menu.

The chicken strips come with a side of radish. We ordered an additional side of rice. The chicken strips are tender and delicious! Be careful: the spicy  chicken is spicy! The only downside is that you cant get extra sauce on the side.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1

The edamame was a generous portion, and cooked and salted perfectly even as to go.  The tenders were delicious, uniques crispy like a batter or breading I haven't seen before.  The only reason they are 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would've liked more sauce on the tenders. Or even a side.  Sauce was very good, but too little of it.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1

11,3511,4032,veoup9SU-lLs4SzQrwcF9w,Bonchon - Pineville,4,"Came for the Korean food because I always get excited when a new Korean place comes to town. Tried the beef bulgogi and was not disappointed. Good portion size, authentic flavors and came in a good amount of time. Staff was courteous and respectful, the atmosphere was pleasant. My only critique was the cost- for a $15+ plate of bulgogi, kimchi should be included on the side. I've never been to a Korean restaurant (in America or Korea) that charged $2.75 for a side of kimchi. It's a staple like ketchup or relish!! That being said, the kimchi was delicious.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1

Babe if you're reading this you are correct this place is the shit I'm so happy I tried it. Definitely my new favorite fried chicken place. Garlic soy chicken wing on point. 

Edit: Second time coming here was not so good to be honest, it wasn't that busy but my food took a while and when I received it the wings I don't want to say it wasn't cooked because chicken inside was good but the outside was soggy and doughy. Consistency is huge for me so I just removed one star till I go a third time see what happens. Everyone has a off day can't blame them","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",0

The final straw was a take-out order of wings they were dry and hard. If they can't get even that much right .... let's say the only reason they're still open is the dearth of good Korean restaurants.

But there is a good one and not too far from here either, expect a long wait to get a table.

17,3517,4038,8okt1nl-g2RL3ylWoqj4tA,Bonchon - Pineville,4,"I had heard about Bonchon Korean Fried Chicken via WBT radio ad. I'm not really a fan of Asian cuisine, but since I REALLY love fried chicken-especially wings- I decided to stop in for a to-go order.  There's no doubt that these wings were very crispy and had the best crunch of any I've had, even after probably losing some of the crunch during the trip home. I ordered both spicy and soy garlic. Now, I love hot spicy, but these were almost too hot for me; the soy-garlic were top notch. We didn't care for the pickled radish that was included as a side, so I'll just let them keep that the next time. The wings have a distinct flavor due to the oil that they use - so they're not going to be exactly like typical southern fried chicken & wings. I'll def go back and dine in. The restaurant is quaint, has a bar, covered outdoor seating and the staff that I came in contact with were very friendly.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1

19,3519,4040,ntUi7UWKcRyUBwvSzB8udA,Bonchon - Pineville,4,"This is my first time here and I ordered the Bull Dak. It says Spicy and has 2 flames but it should have 4 flames. The flavors on it were excellent but it is extremely spicy. If you are someone who does not like spicy food please do not order this as it is hard to enjoy your food when your tongue is on fire. I like trying new things and I have a high tolerance for pain and I do enjoy spicy food but this was beyond that. I couldn't even eat all of it and contemplated if I wanted a to-go box. 
You would think I would give a lower star rating but I don't blame the staff for the menu not being accurate. The waitress did ask if I wanted it made as is and I said yes. In the future they should tell people that it comes really spicy.
The decor and ambiance is great here as well.
Next time I come I will try the fried chicken.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",11

22,3522,4043,9j_1a0rctuJZh5RXUCU0GQ,Bonchon - Pineville,1,"5 stars for the food. 0 for service.  We went on Tuesday night at 8 pm of last week. The place was quiet. Only one other table.  We ordered 4 appetizers and spicy chicken for main course. The appetizers came out quickly.  We almost finished our appetizers and a couple came in.  We waited about 30 minutes, still no chicken and our server was no where to be seen (there were 2 servers that night. One had only one table and ours had us and the new table).  Waited about 30 more minutes and our server came out with chicken but brought to the table that came after us.  They looked surprised but ate a piece of chicken each then pushed the rest aside.  I watched them since I had a feeling that they were our order. 

At this point, our drinks were still not filled once and we were wondering why after an hour, we still didn't get our chicken.  The server walked by so we flagged her to asked about our order.  She looked back to the other table and probably just realized that she had brought our food to the wrong table.  She said nothing then went to the computer probably to check the order then went into the kitchen.  After a few minutes, she told us unapologetically that it would be another 30 minutes because they ran out of chicken. Enough said. We canceled the order, paid for the appetizers and left. 

As a former server, I understand, mistakes happen.  But she had 2 tables the whole time. We didn't expect our server to be chatty but our drinks never got filled, she did not smile once and she never checked on our table the whole an hour+ that we were there.  Again, we liked the food and we would most likely go back but the service will need to be improved or we'll just order take out from now on.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",0

Stopped in for lunch today...and feasted on a huge bowl of Bulgogi Fried Rice, along with 4 jumbo-sized Drumsticks in Soy Garlic flavor. I absolutely love their Fried Rice...it's always so fresh and full of flavor; and their double-fried Chicken is simply the Bomb. Too much so...it gives you that guilt residue afterwards. Not sure if I liked the Americanized pickled version of Kimchi, one of several complimentary sides of choice. With their friendly lunch special, this entire meal with Iced Tea was about 20 bucks...and well worth it. It could have easily served a party of 2! 

This branch location has a much darker, sleeker look than the one at Woodlawn...but I can't decide if I like it better or not. I DO love the fact that every time I'm here, it's very well air conditioned! The service seems a tad faster here too.

Just learned today that they now have 300 locations worldwide...and after you try a few items off their menu (especially this amazing Salmon Avocado Ball!), you'll see why!","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1
24,3524,4045,rYlHp6XpdtybhkoU07odgg,Bonchon - Pineville,4,"Bonchon Chicken should honestly be called Bonchon Pork Belly Buns because their buns stole the show!! The Pork Belly Buns were absolutely amazing! The balance of the pork belly, sauce and the vegetables made it super delicious. It was 9.95 well spent! 

We also ordered Boneless wings plate with Spicy chicken and Soy Garlic chicken. Both were delicious and paired very well with the pickled radish side. It's not the best Korean chicken I've had but it's definitely yummy. 

The Bulgogi Korean Tacos were also a great addition to our meal. The flavors balanced super well together and for $10.95 it is super super filling! The sauces on the tacos honestly made the taco a 10/10 for me. 

Overall, the meal and service were both pleasant but I'd suggest having smaller portions for a cheaper price for some items. I really wanted to try more things on the menu but most items were $10+ and came with big portions when they could do well as an appetizer or side item. I think if they changed their menu up a little bit, it would allow more flexibility for the customer on what they want to order. Surprisingly the chicken was not the star of the show so I'd also like to see them improving on the quality of their chicken dish since it is called Bonchon CHICKEN. But seriously those pork buns were amazing!","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",1

We ordered the Takoyaki (Fried octopus dumplings drizzled with Japanese mayonnaise, Katsu sauce and sprinkled with bonito flakes), a glass of Korean plum wine, and a glass of Korean raspberry wine until we came up with our to-go order.

I got the small wing order (10 pieces), which was half soy and garlic and half spicy with pickled radish and kimchi. OMG the chicken was delicious. Light yet extremely crunchy! It's made per order, so you will wait about thirty minutes. The kimchi and pickled radish were also good, but nothing to rave about.


My boyfriend did the Bull Dak (Spicy chicken stir-fried with rice cakes and Bonchon Signature Hot Sauce, topped with thinly sliced scallions
and mozzarella cheese. Served with white rice.) Talk about spicy, lawd! It was really good though. 

 We ordered his mom the bao buns (pork buns) and soy garlic wings, and she had no complaints!

29,3529,4050,zWA0pKXHS0QH8rdf_kvUDw,Bonchon - Pineville,5,"The whole experience at this location of Bonchon was disappointing. They have two entrances one for dine in which is the entrance next to Walmart and one for take out which is on the side where the Pet Salon is. The inside is spacious and nicely decorated. We came after the lunch rush so about 2pm and we were excited because we were avoiding the rush. Unfortunately we received the short end of the stick. 

We ordered Bibimbop, Bulgogi Korean tacos, and half and half combo fried chicken. The service was slow and the food came out about 20 minutes after we ordered it. The chicken seemed to be over cooked and dry but we didn't want to reorder and have to wait another 20 minutes for the food. I probably would come back for the bulgogi tacos but to go. 

So when we received our food the waiter told us he was leaving for the day and left the check on the table. Which was fine with us but he hovered until we filled out the receipt AND then stayed the whole time hanging out by the bar. So he really didn't leave just clocked out I guess. After we paid we did not receive any drink refills and I had to raise my hand for napkins. No one even cared that we were their only customers.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",0

38,3538,4059,uCAOZSm9uOs7iT1uPIHJug,Bonchon - Pineville,5,"So people just go nuts for this place and I'm not entirely sure why. We tried this location out last night for a quick and easy Friday night dinner while we were out and about running errands. We got there before the crowd, and our overall impression was that the location is nice, but a little hidden, but that is no fault of the restaurant. 

All things considered, the food was pretty decent. We did not get the wings, as we are trying to be a little bit more healthy. We split the salmon stuffed avocado and it was actually pretty delicious. We also split an order of the Korean tacos. Here is where they lost stars. 

The service was horrible. They had one girl sitting at the front door on her phone pretty much the whole time. Two other ladies were servers, and seemed to hit every table but ours. Even as the restaurant filled up we still expected someone to come refill our water, ask us if we wanted another beer, or at least come take our plates away when we were done and ready for our check. When we ordered the avocado, we asked for cucumbers asked for them on the side and the waitress said that wasn't able- which may be able but she could have also just asked quickly. We ordered anyway and my husband just picked out the cucumbers and put them on my plate. When the tacos out, I waved the waitress for an extra of a spicy mayo and it took her over 5 min to bring it over. Again, we were able to look over that, but we had to have another waitress take away our plates after 10 minutes with no service. We when she did come clear the plates we asked for our check and she said sure I'll take it care for you. And then proceed to completely forget she had any recollection she spoke with us. Meanwhile our original waitress never came to check in on us despite now having nothing left on our table. My husband finally gave up and went to the bar and just asked for a check. 

I hate writing poor reviews, and I really do like Bonchon's food. But the service definitely tempered our experience given that we spent more time at the table after we ate than it took to get actually eat. I hope they start getting it right!","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",0

I've eaten Korean dishes since I was a child and I've eaten bibimbap in South Korea as well. You are supposed to have either Korean rice or Japanese rice but they used the cheap Chinese long grain rice. It killed the entire meal. I wanted to impress my mother and take her out to eat but she didn't even enjoy it so it wasn't even worth it. And one of their employees were very rude and service was extremely slow.

My friend swayed me in so we decided to have them for lunch. We used Grub Hub to bring the food so I can't give you information in this review about the ambience if the restaurant.  

I decided to get the House Fried Rice and Shrimp Shumai steamed. I'm almost certain the fried shumai was probably much better than the steamed. The House fried rice had plenty of fresh veggies just like I like and excellent flavor. I loved how colorful it was. I'm trying to cut back on what I eat and already had way to many carbs so I decided to get the shrimp shumai steamed. I really wanted the fried. It was delicious but I know the fried was very tasty.

The prices took me by surprise however the portions were huge, we got what we paid for.
HUGE plus was that they had cold noodle soup just like the wife wanted and gave her flashbacks to The Corner Place in downtown Los Angeles.
The real downside were the gaps in service.  Waited almost 5 minutes to get seated with no one else waiting and staff walking past us a few times.  And the wait to place our order was almost 10 minutes.  After that the servers were very attentive.

86,3586,4107,fG1bDnmABWi_KIJpzXDd9Q,Arirang Korean BBQ,3,".....I'm embarrassed to even say I went to eat here. That's how horrible it is. 

Atmosphere: not enough ventilation for a bbq joint. Only 1 of 4 burners we had were working properly so we had to ask the kitchen to prepare our meats.

Price: overpriced for the quality of foods. Your required to order a minimum of 2 of the kalbi and bulgogi which is $30+ an order but when you cook it it's less than a small Plate of meat for 2. I guess I'm used to California portions. 

Food: I think if we had the opportunity to grill our own meats to the doneness of how we like it - it would have tasted ok. My kids came to dinner bc they offered sushi.. They didn't have sushi at all. Hot stone wasn't even hot stone it was rice no crispy under bottom. 

Service: we asked for a couple minutes to look at the menu and the waitress never came back. My husband had to flag her down. Then well one of our burners didn't work bc our server elbowed our drink into the grill.  Changed it out but didn't work and then it seemed like it affected the burner next to it. They didn't replace the drink until I asked for it. Then we got a bill and still had to pay gratuity. After we paid our server came back and mumbled something about sorry for not giving us any service.

The grill is horrible, really do need more maintenance or even change a new one. All the meats that we order were cook with very low heat which dried it out when it's cooking (yes, we did turn the grill to highest heat).

Big portions and the combos give added value. I had a party of 7 adults. We had combo #6 for 4or5 people and also ordered lamb and shrimp. We feasted and were barely able to finish. It was my friends' first time eating KBBQ, which is why I chose Arirang so they could have the authentic grill experience. They were impressed and loved the food and veggies.
The ban chan was really good, and there were even dishes I had not seen before like brussel sprouts and eggplant. Great bariety and good quality. I found the quality of the meat to be excellent, and we had various types of beef, lamb, ribeye, pork, chicken and shrimp. I read one review that was negative and found it to be unfounded regarding quality. The ambiance is very bare and plain, but I review the food and the service typically, and I only comment on ambiance. For 7 of us with combi #6 plus lamb and shrimp, 2 bottles of soju, 2 bottles of magkoli and 2 sodas, the bill came out to $32 each including tip. We feasted.

I know kimchi tastes better when it's fermented longer, but idk. This kimchi looked very old and didn't taste that great either. The fish cakes were also pretty bad. I had a feeling the fish cakes were possibly undercooked. On top of all that, there weren't any air vents which made it difficult to stay and eat. The entire restaurant was incredibly stuffy due to the smoke The good thing about this place is it's a bit more affordable compared to Manna or Gen.

Little else has changed ... but wait ... there's good news!

The overall KBBQ experience is back, fast service, tasty Banchan's, quality Kalbi, grilling meats, and cold Beer.  That my friends is the main event and why I still frequent this joint. 

On a side note, just in case you all missed the memo ... Hot Sake went out with the Millennium. 
21st Century Sake Bombs are now served Cold ... help spread the Word!

My only suggestions, remodel the dated reception area and trash that boxed Sake heater along with your non-existent customer meet & greet policy. Plenty of room for smiles and a modern display cooler full of new Korean Drinks, Sake's & Sochu's to contemplate while we wait to be seated.

Okay...it's rare but this place has improved ALOT! Great job to the management. It definitely took us by surprise. However, we did only have three people in our group and there wasn't a rush. 

We decided to give this place another go after realizing our intended restaurant was closed for the day. We had k7 and k10. Spicy pork bulgogi and boneless short rib cooked my the kitchen. The food were all prepared well and perfectly seasoned. My only concern was it did take awhile for our food to come out. Luckily we weren't that hungry. The service was great this round too. Tentative and helpful in explaining the menu. Water and side dishes refilled with ease. 

Second chances paid off after all!! I'm hoping and wishing they will stay consistent. We'll definitely be back again. 

Tip: Give this place a try if you don't mind walking out smelling like Korean BBQ goodness :). Large groups be ware of added gratuity still.

This place was takamatsu...now Arirang
Don't bother going...

This place was not prepared for a party of five and up. The customer service here is horrendous. We waited for awhile until the grill was cleaned. That's understandable if it took 5 minutes as discussed but it actually took them 20 minutes to clean. We had to ask for plates, drinks, sauce bowls several times until our request was fulfilled. It's bothersome when something has been asked of several times and they don't care. We were neglected as soon as the food arrived. No water refill. We had to wave a waitress down so many times for the bill. They are disorganized and the food was mediocre. Other Korean establishments are better.

PS. Party of five and up, be prepared for 18% gratuity! The price for bad service...Le sigh.

113,3613,4134,yEqnapIduS1Tfv3RpUS_Dg,Arirang Korean BBQ,4,"I love Korean food.  I love Bibimbap, especially a good priced one.  Been craving Korean for a while so we decided to have it for dinner.

A while back this place was called Takamatsu but the name has since changed but they still server Korean and from what I can tell, they still also serve sushi.  But they did have a sign stating that the sushi bar was closed tonight.  Not a big deal.

The menu had the Korean basics with a couple of Japanese items.  We decide on the garlic edamame, japchae with beef, seafood pancake, and 2 orders of the Bibimbap for me and the wifey.  It was just the wifey and the daughter tonight so that was way too much food.

They brought the edamame and it was super garlicky, which I loved.  They next gave us the side dishes with veggies, sprouts, kim chee, and potatoes.  The usual.  Next comes the japchae and seafood pancake.  The pancake was very good.  It was crispy and not greasy.  Very tasty and not overdone with seafood.  The japchae was also very tasty.  Many places also make this dish greasy but this one was just right.  I also like that they has mushrooms which I have never seen in this dish.  Also the amount on the plate was surprising.  Other places don't give a lot but we had a lot to take home.

Now the Bibimbap.  As described in the menu, a mountain of vegetables and with a couple of slivers of beef.  Top it off with an over easy egg and furikake strips.  Wow...good stuff.  But wait, I like to take hot rice and some gochujang and then mix it all together.  Happy tummy.  

The ambiance hasn't changed in years.  When we went we were lucky cause the place didn't seem to busy.  I read reviews that service was bad but we were served right away.  We were lucky cause a large party came in after us.  All the food was good and the prices were very fair.  Korean food can be expensive but this place was wallet friendly.

Recently, I heard that they changed cooks so my family and I decided to come try their dinner. First of all, their restaurant says it's a sushi bar, but they don't have sushi. Their side dishes looked dull in color and not very appetizing. We ordered mool neng myun which is a icy cold beef broth with noodles and that was lacking so much flavor. Even putting in vinegar, sesame oil, hot mustard, it was still really bland not very good. We also ordered bibim neng myun which is a spicy mixed noodle dish but the sauce was so bland, even when we asked for more sauce to put on the noodles, the flavor didn't change because the sauce was watered down so much. They also use super thin noodles that didn't hold up very well and it just wasn't good as much as we wanted to like it. The galbi seemed ok, my brother ate all of his order. The spicy pork bulgogi didn't taste very good either. The d챕cor inside is really weird, they use garden fencing as d챕cor. The music went from Korean hip hop to acoustic Justin Beiber and it was just weird. Overall, the experience and food was very lacking and we won't be going back.

That was at 7:51pm For the call an when we arrived to the store an sat down, that was approximately 7:57pm. I told the waitress we had a order placed over the phone to dine in an she said no problem let me check if it's ready but never came back. Waitress never asked us what to drink or anything! I was pretty shocked! Another server stopped by an handed us the side dishes and walked away. At that moment, I didn't know who was my server at this point. At 8:13 a waitress passed by we asked if we can get water. She then went to the back an served us the water shortly after that. Now, 8:17 the food comes out. I was mind blown. The meat was not sizzling off the tray. Meat was cold an onions was not grilled. Now keep in mind I've been coming to this place before the new owner an new name. That entree is normally $25 in cost an has a portion to eat for two! The plate I received today was tiny for a child to eat, seriously. I asked to speak to the manager to the waitress an she brought him out. He ask what was wrong with the plate? I said honestly I called to order the food to have it ready by the time I get there. I was not expecting it to be ready as I arrived but did not expect my food to come out almost 20 min either. Plate was not hot, meat was definitely cold. An the manager looked at me with no intentions of apologizing. But he did have a excuse stating originally the cooks placed it in a to go box, and transferred it back onto a plate. So my question to him was, so my food was out while we was sitting an waiting the entire time? He said to me that's correct! Ooookkkk an I asked so what are you going to do about this an he said well I can remake it? That's not the answered I wanted, I was expecting an apology but yet never got it. I looked at him an was in complete shock on how he did not resolve the problem an told him I would not pay for the food nor service. He said ok an yet still never apologized an I asked if I can speak to the owner or get his contact number. He told me he was the owner. Funny because I went there a month ago an another gentlemen older told me the same thing which he was more positive in the store and checked on every table to make sure everyone was satisfied. So he was not the only owner an told him I wanted to talk to him. He refused to give me the contact an I told him flat out.... guess you are going to receive a yelp review by me! New name, and new owner.... I would never recommend anyone to eat at this place. The servers are all new with no serving experience, just like the owner!

Funny how you can you can tell me you check the cameras an reviewed my comments but you can apologize  now but not in person? Sure you can say we ate 75% of the food as well when you have only 13 pieces of beef on the plate an I was accompanied with my lady. We can agree to disagree on the time the food came out on upon arrival although still the service you and servers gave us was terrible!

The second time there was one other table when I arrived. Me and my boyfriend sat down and waited 10 minutes for a menu. When we ordered what we wanted we received our food in 10 minutes and had to wait another just to get water, we asked for water 3 times. Our server kept asking what he was already told several times, we got our water about 20 minutes after walking in the door. Our server proceeded to move the other guest to a different table upon request. When we put in our second order with 3 different items to our first he came back with the same 2 times as our first order which we did not want, when we told him he never came back with our second order but came back which another tables order and we told him we didn't order it and he asked if we wanted to keep it. We denied. We never received our second order, never received service after denying the other guests food. We were at this restaurant for 1 hour and never got anything but water and our first round of food. As we left and asked to speak with a manager he told me that they would speak with me momentarily, I waited 30 minutes standing in the lobby and never actually got to speak with a manager but had my server complain about his job.

When it came back from the kitchen, it tasted like they just fished the shrimp out and dropped some dumplings in.

Server showed his displeasure when we returned the items that weren't right. At one point both the male and female servers were taking shots with people at table next to ours.

Here it goes.. This was the old takamatsu. I was one of the regulars then. I love korean bbq and been to a variety  all over AZ and Cali. It's one of my favorite foods to eat and I never get tired of it either. Bf and I wanted to check this place out since it was lunch time and we were around the area.

We walked in and was greeted. There were about 4 to 5 food servers on a slow week day. There was about 3 customers eating inside ant that's including us. All were just standing because its slow but we were serviced by all as well. Which was a little confusing because some would ask the same question about what we wanted on the menu. We told them several times we already ordered and got this...

We were served our food. The meats are very low quality, sauces they have wasn't great nor good either. They gave me msg plus salt on the side. Everything tasted plain. It's $14 a person for all you can eat. So who can complain right? It's cheap so therefore the quality of the food you're eating is what you paid for. That's why there's a saying you get what you paid for. The service was good but could be better because I feel like they dont communicate on which server should take care of which customer. There's also too many of them so I get it they're probably trying to keep busy and probably bored. Other than that I won't be coming back. Sorry to say this is the worst kbbq ever. Food was just horrible and I am just being honest here.

Better meat quality can improve this place a lot better and have some seafood selections it will catch more customers. Oh and get more sauces on the side not msg and salt please.",['samgyeopsal'],0

173,3673,4194,-kQkrKDXs12XiXVz18Bvxg,Arirang Korean BBQ,5,"Ari rang Korean BBQ is not unlike the others currently trending around the valley and beyond. I noticed one major difference: horrendous service.
When you enter, you can go to the sushi restaurant side or the BBQ side. I have only been to the BBQ side. It is well ventilated, which is nice. The walls are all decorated with people's sharpie phrases, signatures and drawings. Some are funny, some are philosophical, some are lame, and some just are.
The tables are clean, but the inside of the grill controls are yucky. Clean those bad boys! Speaking of the grills, it's like pulling teeth to get a grill change. That would mean that your server would have to visit you once and a while. With a 2 hour BBQ limit, I can see how they make money. If they only visit you once or twice in the two hours, you barely eat anything, and you have no waste, because you're still starving. No one asks about drinks. You get one little plastic water bottle that is mostly ice, and shot glasses to serve it. For a table of 5, this is unacceptable.
The meats were pretty good. There wasn't much in the way of seafood, and every time (we've been twice now) I have asked for the squid, they don't have it. The steamed egg is tasteless. The gyoza is greasy. The tempura veggies were uncooked. If you get a hot green tea, it is served in a molten lava temperature pot with no handle. Like I said, you never see your server. We received incorrect meats, incorrect portions, and no grill changes.

After living in South Korea for a bit I missed having really good Korean barbecue. We arrived around 7:30pm and there were a few families eating. We were seated and taken our drink orders right away. There were 6 of us so we decided to get the Korean combo number 6  (79.99) which came with about 6 different types of meat. We also got an order of chicken teriyaki, steamed egg, and garlic edamame.

We were given all the yummy sides (kimchi, lettuce, radishes, seaweed, squash, beans, and a bean sprout salad) and we each got a bowl of white rice. Our huge meat plate came out quick and we got to grilling! Our waiter was friendly and attentive and made sure we had all that we needed. 

The fun part is the grillin! Throw the meat on there with the peppers, garlic, and onion, wrap it with the lettuce and voala its amazing! The steamed egg is a must try and so is the garlic edamame! We paid close to $150 for all that food but that also included their charge of $23 for tips. All in all the experience was fun and the meat was delicious!

It's 18.99 for ayce dinner. Meats include chicken, pork, ribs, beef, squid, fish fillet and salmon (and ox liver which we did not touch). A couple dollars extra if you want shrimp and lamb. If you want unlimited drinks it's $2.25.

There are also side dishes, steamed rice, and soup to choose from. No dessert though.

Service is quick and you get your food pretty quickly but fairly minimal. Start with the fish fillet as it is much easier to cook well on a clean grill and tastes much better. The salmon was decent as well though not the greatest. The beef was dry. The best meats would probably be the chicken and beef ribs. Very flavorful and marinated to be sweet.

I'd rather come here than Chako. Even if Chako is fancier the food quality is similar but Korean Grill House is much cheaper. Also at Chako the food is incredibly salty - I was still okay after this meal. Here they also added a 13% gratuity to the bill which was unexpected - I would not have tipped that much myself especially at an Asian place that doesn't have a lot of service. And we were only a party of four.

I went last weekend and we shared a chicken and a beef bento box as usual. The pieces of meat were just low quality (tendons and just tough), room temperature, and weren't sliced nicely. I guess the soup and sides were still decent. I remember a box was 4 bucks back in primary school, and its been raising since...now its $7 - $7.25...that's a bit much considering the quality decline. Okay, and then I used to love the pork bone soup here although it was never authentically korean. But wow, this time, there was barely any meat on the few bones, a few chunks of hard uncooked potatoes, a few pieces of shred cabbage, and the broth tasted artificial - it was spicy but lacked any meat flavour. It costed $10.  I would probably still go to the DT location for their lunch KBBQ for 15 dollars probably.","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",0

I enjoy the fact that you can cook for yourself. First off you can cook your meat how you like it and it's a fun experience to share. 
I enjoy going with my husband. Only reason I gave it a 4 is the service is quite slow. Sometimes you ask for something and they take a while to get to you. I know at times it's busy so it is a lot to manage but then more staff should be on hand.

The price has gone way up since the last time I came (last year), so it's now $18.99 on a Friday night for their regular menu (without add ons or drinks). This also doesn't include tax or tip. For larger groups, a 13% mandatory gratuity is added on.

One thing I really appreciate is how they have salmon on their regular menu. What I don't like so much is that the pieces are really uneven. That being said, when cooked right, it's delicious.

Sauce-wise, while they have soy sauce, they don't have anything else on the table (and I didn't ask for anything else). I brought cumin in my purse (yes, I'm weird like that). It made things taste interesting. One of the biggest problems I have at Korean BBQ is that everything starts to taste the same after a while. Cumin was today's attempt at preventing that, and it worked.

All in all, at this place, you get what you pay for.

What I really appreciated about today's visit was that the service for my group booking for 21 was that the servers were very attentive. All our needs were met, all our orders were given to us WITH THE PROPER NUMBERS FOR EVERYTHING, and they kept our cake in the fridge, cleared our tables before cake, and gave us a knife and plates and everything. There was no cake cutting charge either. I had a member of my group who doesn't eat meat, so they also allowed her to order off the a la carte menu while still sitting with us. 

I'll be back because they do group bookings right! =)","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1

There's always a table open for me and my friends and it's never too crowded or loud. During the lunch menu there isn't any beef short ribs which was kindof a let down because my friends and I really only like the sliced beef, short ribs and chicken. My advice is to just skip seafood all together, it's not worth the pain. In general seafood at kbbq is never that great and usually falls apart or doesn't taste that great so unless you're a big seafood lover you can do without it. As for side dishes, the kimchi is always on point and so are the radishes and sliced potatoes. Depending on what day during the week you go, sometimes you'll find the portions are a lot smaller than usual. The first time I went they had pretty big cuts of meat but the last time I went the cuts were very small and thin but that's not an issue since it's AYCE you can just order more.

It gets really packed on the weekends, especially at night so make sure you make reservations! It can get really loud so you'd have to raise your voice to have a conversation. 

The decor is modern, lights are dimmed throughout except for the bright lights that are lit directly above the grill and your table.

209,3709,4230,BibzA2yOZw6kckE3erprcg,Korean Grill House,4,"This was another great place that our Canadian fam took us.  This is the IT spot for Korean BBQ. I can see why the place is packed with customers and others who would squirm in to get a table on a busy night. For $13.95 (adult), all-you-can-eat menu, it includes pork, chicken, beef (kalbi short ribs/Bulgogi or marinated BBQ beef), ox tongue, ox liver, salmon, squid, and fish fillet. An extra $3 for lamb and shrimp. And an all-you-can drink for $1.95 (choice of juice/soda). 

The food was phenomial! The service on the other hand was a different story. Our grill plate had to be changed at least 2-3x after all the charcoal clung onto the meats. The waiter was young, incompetent, and coped an extremely bad attitude. When we flagged him for water, meat, etc., he would literally mumble underneath his breath with a nasty expression. When we ordered a pitcher of ginger ale, he claimed they couldn't do a pitcher which was solely for juice or beer. When we asked for refills, viola, he came out with a magic pitcher to refill our cups. It would had saved him a load of work if he just served us the pitcher from the get-go. We had a different waiter who would tend to us since he kept disappearing.  

Although, it's not an authentic Korean BBQ place, the food and concept is relatively the same. The joint is owned by Vietnamese staff. The place itself functions like a prep station similar to a factory: Flag the next customer and get them seated, carry out trays of all-you-can eat meats, refill their drinks, clean/wipe table, etc. It's apparent that the staff feels quite disgruntled since they are being overworked for meager wages.

After weeks of searching for a new Korean BBQ place to eat, this one will always be number 1 to me and have me coming back for more. 

The last time I was here the place was in definite need of a makeover, perhaps be like the rest of the KGH downtown. It was clean and all but it just looked old, with the bright lights, wooden walls, and bamboo. Made you feel like you were eating in a forest. Fast forward 2 months later and WOW! Definite modern contemporary look, with dark tones and just the right amount of lighting. It has a lot more appeal to it and is probably the best looking KGH in the GTA. I kinda felt under dress just because the place looked so much nicer than it was. 

As for the food it's always great no matter what. Very well marinated and takes little time to cook. For those that don't know here's a little KGH 101.

So it is an AYCE BBQ with 4 different AYCE selections the first is the basic, chicken, pork, beef, white fish and squid for $9 but that's only during lunch or after 10pm. 

The 2nd menu is all of the above but with beef ribs, ox tongue, ox liver, Korean sausage and salmon for $14. 

The 3rd menu is all of the above plus shrimp and lamb for $17. 

Lastly, for all those vegetarians it's $5 for AYCE veggies.  

With the AYCE you get side dishes of beef soup, radish, kimchi, bean sprouts, spicy bean sprouts, tofu, and potatoes. All very good, but I must point out the kimchi is the BOMB, it destroys every other kimchi at any Korean restaurant. It's not sour like most places I've been to and has just the right amount of spice. Lastly with AYCE it's AYCD for $2 Pretty sweet deal I think.

For those that don't want AYCE, they do have a regular menu, which I still have to taste, and trust me I will. For those wondering what's on the a la carte menu, you get all the BBQ stuff, different types of soup, bibimbop and different types of fried rice.

Items to definitely get:

- Kalbi (Beef Ribs)
- Kimchi
- Chicken - the chicken has a curry taste to it, different but I like it
- Bulgogi (Beef)","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1

Includes: Beef, Pork, Chicken, Fish Fillet, Sausage, Salmon, Squid, Ox Liver, Beef ribs, Side dishes, and rice.

FOOD: I've always enjoyed kbbq. Not because I like to eat a lot of meat or anything. It's just general idea of sitting down in front of a hot grill in the middle of the night, watching your food cook and the wonderful smell. The food here is alright. Nothing to be excited about. For an AYCE, I guess the price is considered decent. They have a night owl special (10pm-close) for those of you who go out late. For $12.99, the meat selection is cut in half. In my most honest opinion, it's not worth it. Because I love my ribs, salmon, and sausage. The ribs is really the main dish. Has anyone noticed that their beef has gotten worse over the years? It's a huge chunk of bad quality beef with no fat. WHERE'S THE FAT?!  And their side dishes..it was awful. Radish had no crunch to it, the kimchi was watered down. Potato - didn't they used to serve some sweet honey potato? What happened? 

SERVICE: Angry faces, occasional rudeness, and very forgetful. We asked for a grill change and it took 4 reminders to finally get it done. And is it just me or do they never bring the right amount of dishes you ask for?

LOCATION: Is fine. A bit small and tight. Try parking across the street by Scotiabank.

CLEANLINESS: Assuming they don't spit in the food, it looks clean and ever since the renovation, the place looks a lot nicer.

CONCLUSION: I prefer paying the same price or more (for 2) to eat authentic (or close) kbbq in North York's ktown. Tons of side dishes that actually taste amazing, deliciously marinated Bulgogi (beef) and Kalbi (ribs).. Oh that fatty pork belly...and the yummmy eel!!! Drools..!! And to top it off, they usually come with a stone pot soup of your choice. For two people the bill is about $30-$40 (depends on what you order). You really don't know Korean bbq until you've tried it. It is to die for :) I recommend Oh Geul Boh Geul or Piggy's Restaurant or Songcook's (all in North York).

From past experience, it takes at most 5 minutes for them to bring the food out (chicken, beef, pork, etc), but this time we waited around 25 minutes, and there was still no food. We tried to make eye contact with the servers but they just ignored us until one of them came up, and asked if we filled out the order. When we said we did, he told us that they lost it, and asked us to fill out another order. In the meantime, they gave us pork, beef, chicken right away, so we didn't have to wait for a second order. Due to the poor service, we decided to take tips off but when the bill came, tips were already included (13%) and they don't mention it unless you had to analyze the bill.

This is good place for group gatherings because it is interactive with people cooking and serving each other the food. The service was quick and consistent. We went after 10pm so it was cheaper as well. I liked this because often people working retail get off after nine making it difficult to find a spot with decent food.

As far as the food is concerned, it is ok , more towards the good side than the bad. The food is nothing special but it is the experience of cooking it and eating that makes it good. Some meats were marinated like the chicken, while the rest are brought out plain (beef, fish, squid, and pork).  This is a good for people who enjoy simple food.

For $10 a person, I was happy with the food and the service.","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1

I got there at 7:30 pm. Unfortunately, since it is in a plaza, parking was limited. I had to park all the way at the back and around the corner. The table was reserved so we were able to sit down immediately. As my friends slowly trickled into the restaurant, we quickly placed our orders by marking a piece of paper. We obviously did the All-You-Can-Eat. It was about $16.00.

Let's just say we had enough meat to last us for DAYS! The only downfall of this location is that a table of 6 only has 1 grill which meant that only 2 or 3 people could do their cooking at once. However, if you go with amazing people...they will feed you :) 

The service there was good. Our food came out in a timely manner and refills on our drinks were...a bit muddled at times. The supervisor, Alex, was great though. He made sure that our table was well stocked of food and drinks. He even got another server to come by to change our grill a few times throughout the night.

There are a  lot of selection in the All You Can Eat Menu such Salmon, Beef Ribs, Squid, Chicken, Beef, Pork, etc.  The side dishes that come along with the meal (Kimchi, Tofu, Bean Sprouts, Beef Bone Broth) were nice compliments with the meal.

Then died off later on when the restaurant got busy since there was 2 guys serving.  You get 2 sheets to fill out, i guess you can only order 2 times or something.

First time there, not a fan of korean bbq.  We had pork, pork sausage, beef ribs, chicken, salmon, fish fillet.  Basically we just grilled them and ate them.  Not much flavor but burnt bbq.

After about 1 hour and a half, server left us for dead, asked for tea, ice tea, multiple times, and never received it, guess they wanted us out.  When i asked for the bill, he was quick...

Overall I wouldn't return.  Sure it was a nice experience cooking your own food on a grill.  But there wasn't much flavor, and everything tasted burnt after a lot of meat.

We always order the bento boxes with grilled chicken, pork, or beef which came with beef soup, rice, bean sprouts, potatoes, a free soft drink...and it used to cost like $4 ...but now its like $6 I think :(. It's really inexpensive still, delicious, and filling! I also order the bibimbap and pork bone soup with potatoes once in a while. The bibimbap was mediocre at the very most, but the pork bone soup is one of my favourites ever. It might not be the most authentic, but it is so flavourful, has lots of meat, nappa cabbage, and potato chunks...also comes with some yummy sides!

And the first time I tried the fancy AYCE with all the options.  We enjoyed both the pork and beef options but weren't too keen on the shrimp and seafood were okay.   The shrimp comes with full skin, head and vein so it's quite a hassle...but the minimal offer of side dishes (esp the kimchi and radish) are great and it's a great low carb eat option for me.  Meats are of average quality so they are good when cooked thoroughly and eaten right away.  A star lost because the seafood options could be done better and the meats could be of better quality.   Just order the regular all you can eat and get pork and beef, cook and eat right away and you will be fine.","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1

Some pros:
- service is great, a lil hard sometimes to track down someone to take your order but with so many other tables to wait on, I'm not too upset about it
- wait time is never bad. The restaurant is big with lots of tables which always makes my visits here one without a wait time or a short one
- prices are great. You get exactly what you pay for with lunch or night owl specials making prices even better
- the AYCE menu has a pretty decent selection but if that's not enough, there's an extensive list of non-AYCE dishes to choose from
- restaurant atmosphere is also great. Really nice place to chill and catch up with friends.
- location of the restaurant is great. I say this because I like to skip out on getting dessert here and heading right across from the restaurant to Coco Tea and Juice.

Some cons:
- sometimes servers' inability to speak English sucks. One time I ordered tofu and kimchi soup off the AYCE menu and they brought me tofu and kimchi side dishes instead. I asked for it to be taken away and attempted to order my soup again,  and once again they brought me side dishes. Happened again and I gave up and realized I wasn't going to get my soup.
- wish their veggie side dishes were more extensive
- wish they had sauces to eat the meats with considering their meats and veggies aren't seasoned.

That's all I have to say. If you're looking for a chill night out with our spending too much money, I recommend this place.

EDIT: I've recently become vegetarian since writing this review and something amazing at this Korean Grill House is their willingness to let me order off the AYCE menu while the rest of the table can still do AYCE. I've called other locations to see if they did this and this appears to be the only one willing to do so which makes it the best location in my books!","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",0

We got the meat deal (all of the meat plus all of the veggies), that was really great. The meat is marinated but I didn't have a problem with it. I loved the kimchi! 

The downfall of this place was definitely their service, my boyfriend and I were having a great time, until we ordered more food and asked for water.

The server avoided us like the plague even though I was attempting to flag him down and did not check up with us once on his own.

239,3739,4260,QAuLAbANZsSG_i3-324Wag,Korean Grill House,1,"i was so disappointed with this korean grill house. i went on a saturday night. originally from looking at the reviews and menu online, me and my friends believed that the night owl special was 11.99, but the waiter persisted to tell us that they changed it & it's now 17.99. Kind of a bummer cause we were going for the low price. we continued to be seated down & started to place our order for drinks. two of my friends ordered soft drinks & i ordered a water. the waiter told us that my two friends can only get canned drinks ($2) because i'm getting a water. unlimited refilled drinks are $2.25 ... i don't want to be forced into buying a soft drink. i don't like soda. i hate the fizz. He then brought me my water & THE CUP WAS DISGUSTING. that was 1 strike for me. going on with our night , we continued to order our meats (17.99 gave us chicken , beef & pork slices & fish fillet). one of my friends are allergic to fish, so we asked that he didn't get it, but once again , the guy proceeded to say that everyone must order the same things at the same table. it's 17.99 with or without fish. i don't understand why he just couldn't bring one serving of it. When we placed our food on the grill, it burnt instantly; our grill was way too hot. With all my anger built up with this place, i just went to the bathroom to try and escape the night for a little. However, when i came across the bathroom, the disgust of it matched the customer service. This was my 2nd strike. Coming back to my seat to try & rush through the rest of our night, we finished our first round of meat & wanted a second round. there was a little button you can press to request a waiter at our table . we pressed this button 100 times & no one showed up at our table. the button is completely useless. we waited like 30 min for a waiter to come and acknowledge we wanted more meat. When he went to get it, he took forever to bring it back out to us. Our appetite was kind of gone at this point. & i was just done for the rest of the night (strike 3). The meat wasn't well marinated; it was completely bland. The rice was hard & cold. The beef broth was gross. The kimchi was alright lol. We went to pay our bills & one of my friends was paying debit. They were charging $1 for using the debit machine & he was pissed that they couldn't mention it to him before. i do understand that some machines charge a fee, but it would be nice that they told us all the terms & conditions before the night started. I would most definitely choose chakos over korean grill house. this was my first & will be my last time ever going here. My bill here was $50 (2 people) vs at Chako's it was $56 (2 people) & at Chakos , we at least got better service , nice drinks , the meats we requested & a nice atmosphere with enough elbow space. i will never come here again.","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",0

First of all, it's Chinese owned. If you have Korean friends, they can quickly point out all the ways that the food and style is not authentic. But who cares, it's BBQ meat! It's always good! They are Chinese so as expected, service isn't that good. 

Second of all, I come here for the value. It's cheaper than AYCE sushi. Every once in a while, you just want to stuff yourself with meat. This is one of the best places to do it because you can hang out with your friends or family while cooking together. 

Thirdly, a lot of Korean places don't do AYCE. Some do, but they usually have restrictions like you only have 1 type of meat. KGH gives you several choices of meat/seafood. 

I'd say the quality of meat you get is generally worse than what you get at Korean places. But that's more than made up with quantity. The seasoning is slightly off. Also, the side dishes are definitely way off the mark. But you didn't come here for the side dishes. You came here for mountains of meat. Get ready to feel meat sweats after eating here.

Food was standard for the chain, I've visited other locations in Toronto and quality has remained consistent which is nice to see with franchises. 
The service left a bit to be desired, we ordered a large Sapporo which after several minutes we had to order again before receiving it well into our meal. 

In an effort to balance out the copious amounts of meat we were planning on eating, we opted to order the veggie add on. It was not worth the extra 3 dollars each. For two of us we got two VERY thinly sliced rounds of green pepper, a handful of halved mushrooms, a couple large leaves of romaine lettuce, sliced white onion, and a few pineapples. Yes, this is also AYCE, however it would have been nice to have chunks of peppers so they could grill nicely.

I've been coming to this location for almost 20 years and have always love it. The food WAS great, and the staff were friendly. 

Lately, within the last 3 months, their food has been overly salty. First,  their signature sweet soy sauce (the ones they have in the bottles on the tables) went from great to concentrated salt water. No sweetness left...

Then their meat marinate started to get salty as well. I told one of the owners about it and they said they were aware and was gonna to fix it soon. 

Ok... Nothing improved for 2 months. 

Today,  my parents wanted to go their for lunch.  I ordered my usual. BBQ beef lunch box. SALTY,  EVERYTHING.  

SALTY BEEF, SALTY TOFU, SALTY RADISH, SALTY BEAN SPROUTS,  even the rice was SALTY. Everything tasted like a salt lick!  Yuck! 

I'm not returning to any of their locations till they get better cooks with proper tongues, or get rid of 3/4 of their salt use.

They use a paper ordering system for your ayce picks, customer marks how many of each item they wish.  For the late night offering, it is beef, chicken, pork, fish, squid & pork belly.  Drinks are extra @ $2.25 for aycd.  Wife and I selected chicken, pork and squid.  We filled out the paper 3 times and we never received our squid.  Our first order of chicken and pork was short of 1 tray each.  the Banchan (side dishes) were kinda sad to say the least..tried the tofu, sprouts, radish & Kimchee.  Didnt get enough the banchan servings were smaller than other places we have been to.  The first bowls of rice we were served were tasty..however the 2nd set of rice ordered was different.  Seemed like it was from a completely different batch or brand (was also hard).  

Also we tried to order from the regular menu..since we weren't really up for ayce that night..but due to the cook leaving early at 9pm..only the ayce was available.  Another downside..no dessert options as other KBBQ spots have.

Odds are we shall return to our go to spot for KBBQ (Chako).  We just wanted to try a different KBBQ spot.  Likely won't be back.  If they didn't mess up our order for squid and refill on the sprouts and tofu banchan I would have given 3 stars at least.

Highlights of the meal were the beef, beef ribs, chicken, salmon and white fish.

The kimchi is so good here. I love it. it's made sweet and spicy at the same time with a hint of sour. 

the night owl (11.99 for basic pork, beef, pork belly, chicken, squid, fish fillet) I would say is worth it. But the actual real deal (ribs) are 10x better. so we got that ordered on the side for ($11) which only came with less than 10 ribs. 

the soup was sort of sour or maybe it was the bowl.. 
I usually go crazy over it but hardly finished one yesterday 

the service is good. friendly young servers,

the lime soda juice is good but expensive lol","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1
258,3758,4279,D0ADbXdaGSP-T-La8ehHtQ,Korean Grill House,3,"I have been to this Korean Grill House enough times to say I am officially  done with korean bbq for the time being and to bid farewell to it I thought I may as well put a review.

Firstly, as far as environment goes I personally have no issue with the way the restaurant is set up. If you are sitting in the middle of a table of six you will be in the unfortunate position of having no leg space to save your life. Hopefully your arms can still reach the grill and you find comfort in the company you are with.  

The wait staff is friendly, if you order more rice than the amount of people at your table, for example, if you know you will need an extra bowl of rice immediately and just want it on the side, you will not receive that until you do your next call for meats. Sometimes the wait stuff can be slow, i like to think its because of the amount of people in the restaurant but that is more out of kindness and not in line with reality. Regardless, you do receive your food on time. ( FYI : IF YOU ORDER A REFILLABLE SOFT DRINK, YOU WILL NEED TO BEG AND PLEAD TO HAVE THAT REFILLED, BE WARNED ) 

Now, presentation wise, there really isn't much that can be said. The sides look authentic, appetizing. You are cooking the meat so you have the freedom to either devour that cow in a second or create a beautiful display on your plate, the choice is yours. Taste, if you eat the meat alone, aside from the short ribs, I don't really see that much flavour coming from the food. Luckily they have soy sauce and chili oil on the side that greatly enhance what would be an extremely bland protein meal.

Price has gone up over the years and service has remained relatively consistent.

This is an average Korean Grill House where you can gather and eat a meal, nothing exceptional. Eventually you will grow tired and seek greater culinary adventures as I have.","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1
259,3759,4280,qIIWAMJ_LwlJi0fntUpsjg,Korean Grill House,3,"Came here for dinner after a Raptors game, because we were craving Korean bbq. I've been here a few times and it's okay, not amazing but not horrible.

To begin, the service is okay. I mean, there's a bunch of waiters that will be helping you out. Majority of them are nice, but make sure you look at what they are giving you, because sometimes they can get confused. However, the waiter did let us know that the tips were included, which is a huge plus because some Korean bbq places do not tell you.

The place itself is alright. I personally feel like it's so crowded in there that you can literally hear other people's conversations around you. Also, the washrooms are pretty gross! So I suggest you don't use it unless you really have to.

The food was alright. I personally loved the beef and thought it was the best to cook. Ribs were also good, but the beef was better. One sad thing is that this place does not have dessert, not even ice-cream!!","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",0
260,3760,4281,5ZdhBMMeHr25ytPMx7ToqA,Korean Grill House,4,"Korean Grill House is a good place for meat. 
Meat meat meat, lotsa meat. Meat is how I live, meat is how I roll, and this place is full. of. Meat. 
This location of Korean Grill house is in a small plaza off midland Ave, so it's fairly hard to park, which is a small downside. the inside of the restaurant houses a lot of people, and it's always packed, so you have to wait to get a seat. 
You have either the choice of an all-you-can-eat grill, or a lunch bento box (at lunch). Being a regular customer after church, I come here (it's in the area) and usually get the bento box, as I'm starving after service. It's a fairly stable meal choice, with the choices of several kinds of meat at about 8-12 dollars each, with rice, tofu, a bunch of Asian veggies, and of course MEATTTT MEATMEATMEATMEATTTTTTTTT!!!!! sorry. 
I find the beef is either very very very  good or satisfactory, and is a risky choice to make, depending on the chef that is cooking your food, which you have no control over. I usually order the chicken, which is seasoned and marinated to perfection, with a good portion given to you. However, I find you sometimes have too much rice, and end up being able to have one bite of rice and one bite of meat, or vice versa, and have to finish your meat with no rice to mellow out the rich taste (though too much meat is fine :D) I wouldn't recommend getting anything else as they don't season those enough in  my opinion. 
As for the all-you-can-eat grill, it's super cheap, at what I remember of something like 13 dollars for one adult? anyways they give you tons of options of MEATTTT including beef, chicken, salmon for one deal and I think if you add 2 dollars for everyone you get Lamb and shrimp, which you should do, I mean it's only 2 dollars...
You don't want to pass down the grilled beef, as it's in delicately sliced slices, marinated with a sharp eye for taste (or should I say a sharp tongue), and completely delicious. The grill all in all is great. 
The service is mediocre, which is the only reason I'm taking off a star, since sometimes your order gets mixed up and/or it takes a year to get to your table at lunch. 
All in all it's a great place to go if you want meat, but not a great place for vegetarians and vegans :D. If I ever feel the craving for tons of grilled meat, I'm coming here.","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",0
261,3761,4282,R7kYyeuYTQXVEq02XtnJUw,Korean Grill House,4,"This was my second time at this AYCE Korean bbq spot. We stick to the basic package that includes beef, chicken and pork with some fish along with all the little Korean side dishes. I'd stick to the beef. The pork sausage is okay but the regular pork isn't worth the time. The chicken is good but takes a while to cook. If you like fish, I'd go with the salmon.

The service is great. All the employees will help your table by clearing your dishes, filling your drinks, taking more orders or even switching out your grill for a fresh one. 

The restaurant is really nice and modern feeling. The hours are the best. It's great if you're looking for a meal later at night. You won't be the only ones in there either!

How things have changed and it's not a negative comment intended at all.  The customers that frequent this place before now PACK the newly opened Chako just a block North.

THANK GOD that when I went to Chako they told my group it will be 45 minutes and we BOLTED out passing through the parking lot that resembled the Canadian International Auto Show more than a Scarborough Parking Lot.

It's like everyone immigrated one block North at the same time. I'm so glad because now I come back to this OLD hang out to enjoy the same Korean BBQ I've had all these years but WITHOUT the noise from the bulk immigration.

One thing I've noticed is the young gentlemen that served us, even the floor manager was too.  I even noticed one that was simply NEWBIE style all the way, seem so confused how to do his job while this other school kid had to lead him by hand every step of the way.

Another noticeable change is that it is no longer a PURELY Asian customer spot but more of a United Nations effort.  :-)

The AYCE menu items still taste good as the last time's I've been here and unfortunately SERVICE rating stays stagnant as it takes effort to wave over a nearby waiter to take your Order($13.95: Pork, Beef, Chicken, Beef Ribs, Ox Tongue, Ox Liver Salmon, Squid, Fish Fillet) or get Drink Refills($1.75 extra)

I'm not sure when, but they actually changed the location of the washroom so now you don't have to walk pass the kitchen to the back passing the JUNK of stuff on the side to your way to the dirty washrooms.  

It now has a SPOT LIGHTED entrance with white tiles looking like a Shrine.  It freaked me out so much I didn't even have to PISS.  I'll check it out next time...","['kongnamulmuchim', 'galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1

The service is pretty decent, but it's never just your one server - it's basically anyone with a black tee you can call out to or flag down that'll get the job done.

Everything tasted great and we have very happy bellies.
New was a build your own waffles. We didn't have it this time.

Service is good your raw meats come to the table quickly. The kimchee is their low point - it looks old and stale. I am a big meat eater with a greater appetite. 

On a previous visit, I noticed they seemed to get upset when I ordered too much meat but I persisted and left a large tip which they seemed happy with. 

On another visit, I ordered a lot and noted they are ingenious when it comes to making you order less and try to have you leave early. They had their staff sit at the next table where they started talking loud and laugh equally as loud. I got angry and continued eating, left no tip and didn't come back for a good 8 months.  Leave it to our Chinese to dream up these tactics. Places like these don't last.

You want six dishes of bean sprouts? Have two. 

We're missing four more bean sprouts. Oh okay. Here, have two. 

It doesn't matter what quantity you order. You will always get main dishes in threes (beef, pork, chicken, fish, squid) and side dishes in twos (tofu, bean sprouts, kimchi, etc.) We followed up on our order four times and they still didn't give us what we ordered. It didn't matter if it was the same or different server. Main dishes in threes and side dishes in twos. 

They said they lost the order sheets or acted confused. The servers were never rude or defensive about our missing orders, but repeated reminders can be a tiring exercise when you just want to eaaaaat. 

I wouldn't recommend coming here near the end of the night or you won't get what you order. Their closing the is 1:30am but their last call is midnight and they'll tell you they close at 1:00am. Leave (Get Out). The second we sat down around 12, they told us our order (our first) would be our last call order. 

I was satisfied with the food. The meat is thinly sliced so it cooks very quickly, and pork was the clear standout for me. It was delicious. 

The bean sprouts side dish was really good too (they're small dishes so we ordered four; we got two. We ordered ten more; we got two.) Tofu was yummy too.

Unfortunately, that's about as reliable as it gets. Service and cleanliness is always hit or miss here. Although lately the service has been nice and friendly. If it's busy, they're spread out pretty thin that you have to flag them down for awhile to get anything you need. It makes you feel like you're cheering for the Raps from the nosebleeds, hoping someone sees you. The sheets they give you to mark down what you want is almost moot. I've never gotten exactly what I've requested. They consistently forget or are slow to bring drink orders or marked sheet items. 

Regular dinner AYCE includes the following: 

Side dishes: tofu, kimchee, pickled radish, non spicy bean sprouts, spicy bean sprouts, beef broth, potato, and steamed rice 

Meat & Seafood: beef, beef ribs, ox liver, chicken, pork, pork sausage, squid, salmon, white fish fillet 

Mon - Thurs - $23.99
Fri - Sun & Holidays - $24.99

If you don't mind late night pigging out, coming here for their late night special is worth it. It starts at 10pm and it's a more condensed menu (you don't get beef short ribs, sausage, liver or salmon) but you certainly can fill up on everything else for about $6 less than reg price. 

Lunch or Late Night Special 
Mon - Thurs - $17.99
Fri - Sun & Holidays - $18.99

But now I have to write a review to let others know that their quality has gone downhill. We ordered the typical dak gal bee. You have the option for chicken or chicken seafood nssve yourself the $ and get the chicken.

The seafood is pathetic, some small mussels and squids and shrimps. The noodles are good and so is the sauce. However they limit how many noodles you can get (it's 1 noodle pack per pan).

Service was very friendly and quick, I especially like how they leave a bottle of water at your table so you don't have to constantly ask for a refill. The JapChae glass noodles came out quickly but were a bit too sticky for my liking. It made it hard to swallow. The Dak Gal Bee came shortly after and despite all the other reviews it was a good portion size for two people, an overall heavy dish. The ramen noodles were a staple piece, so I definitely recommend getting those as a side. The flavour for both dishes were very sweet so half way through it got too much to finish. In general an alright Korean comfort food restaurant.",['dakgalbi'],1

Seems like portions have decreased a bit (is it not sweet potato season guys????) and very sadly, our rice cakes were undercooked. If you're here for the first time, I'd recommend the chicken dakgalbi, and you must add the cheese and ramen!! Skip the seafood option as we only got like what, 5 tiny pieces of baby octopus.

This is usually the only place I'll come to for dakgalbi so it'll still do but on the hunt for a better place.",['dakgalbi'],0

The restaurant is tight-spaced and pact however, the wait in line was decent and took about 10 - 15 mins. Let's get to the point now. The food. It was great. I guess it depends on what toppings you add on but I find that cheese can make most things taste that much better. to be honest,  I am not a ramen or any kind of instant noodle fan. I try to avoid them as much as possible but the images my friends sent me of this place kind of sparked my curiosity. You basically get a pan of ramen which can be shared between 2-3 people depending how many other toppings you add. I feel that once you add them up, it can cost quite a bit. I got the cheese, rice cake, fish cake, veggies and extra ramen for this ramen dish and it was shared among two people. Definitely filled both of us. I think if many of my friends like ramen, I'll come back with them. Only downside is that the ramen was a tad dry. I wish they had more sauce. Other than that, I probably will not come here myself. But definitely had a good experience with an average friendly service.",['dakgalbi'],0
298,3798,4319,0SZy4uieBzBzg54vRdAfgw,Joons Restaurant,3,"I came here for dinner with a group of friends as an alternative to Korean BBQ. Of our group of 6, one ordered Bibimbap, 3 of us shared the Dak Gal Bee and 2 shared Bulgogi. I wouldn't recommend coming with a group larger than 8, as even with 6 of us it was a bit awkward.

The table-top cooking experience was interesting, but the staff are very unobtrusive when they come by to give the ingredients a quick stir and make sure everything is cooking along as it should. We just kept on with our conversation and soon everything was ready to be eaten!

4 of us (including me!) are self proclaimed wusses when it comes to spicy food, and the Joon's original sauce was ok for the 3 having the Dak Gal Bee, but too much for one of my friends having the Bulgogi. I think it has to do with how much sauce they add at the beginning because as it cooks and reduces the sauce gets spicier. I found the spiciness enjoyable because it added a kick but wasn't uncomfortable. If my taste buds needed a break I would take a bite of the mashed potato side dish (yummy!). 

After our Dak Gal Bee (chicken, veggies, with extras of rice sticks, sweet potato and seafood) was mostly done, our waitress added white rice and made a delicious fried rice dish on the wok using the remaining sauce. I think it was the best part of the meal!

Bibimbap tip: if you are not sure how spicy you like this dish, scoop out some of the hot sauce first. The put a lot in the dish and you are supposed to stir it all up before you eat, but my sister did that her first time and nearly died from spicy heat! It's much easier to add more than try to eat something that's burning your mouth. 

My friends who have been down to Joon's on Bloor St. said that the menu here is smaller, however this was a fun restaurant with friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere. I'm personally not the biggest fan of spicy food, but if you like spicy Korean food this is definitely a spot to check out.

The service was ok, but the food wasn't good at all. The cabbage was undercooked, so was the rice cakes. Over all, had a lot better experience before. I'm not sure if I will be going back.

301,3801,4322,t-0_us3OTzs_ZhKy6fcamg,Joons Restaurant,1,"Decent food (especially since there are no other dak galbi places in Toronto) but service is TERRIBLE and portions are tiny!!!

I've been here with just one other person, and another time with a large group and both times we weren't served enough food.  Miraculously, a pan of dak galbi with 2 portions is exactly the same size as one with 3 portions (with the same kind of meat and exact same add-ons).  Why???  WHY would I pay 50% more to get the same amount of food?!  Note that 2 portions is *barely* enough food for 2 adults.

The kicker is that because we discovered when the food arrived that it wasn't enough, we asked for the menu so that we could order more food and we were told that we weren't allowed to!  What restaurant only allows people to order just once?  Especially when their portions are miniscule!  And WHY didn't they tell us so at the beginning or state it somehwere on their menu?!

I make my own dak galbi at home now.  It's easy to make, it tastes way better, the portions are appropriate, it's cheaper, and I can put whatever in it I want.  I don't understand why veggies cost extra for dak galbi at Joons.  That's totally unreasonable to me too.  I wouldn't go back.",['dakgalbi'],0

Everything is good, but it's pretty standard and I wouldn't say anything warrants more than a 3-star review.

I love table-top cooked dishes, they are the best because you share same thing with everyone...which means no crying over who ordered a better dish. But really, it's fun with table-top cooked dishes because you can add things depending on what you order and they make you fried rice at the end.

Table-top cooked dishes are quite common in Korea, they are usually very cheap and easy to find in small neighbourhoods and people usually enjoy them as a meal or to eat with soju. Last time I was in Korea, I had Dak-Gal-Bee in MyungDong and it was so delicious...I can still dream about it. It's pretty damn spicy and yes, you smell like you showered in the sauce after- but you just have to deal with it if you want to experience good Korean food!

Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee (JS-1) 4/5

* Chicken (boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables (cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion) 
* Choose your spiciness (we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce)
* $9.25 per portion (2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people
* Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice
* Extra add ons are all $2 except the fried rice
* Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked
* Because it's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy
* Servers will come around and cook them for you so don't worry about the process
* If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end
* For 3 portion order, I found there weren't much chicken
* Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all!! If I say it's not spicy...it's really not spicy
* I didn't like the mozarella cheese, it had weird texture and it took away the spiciness of the dish
* Instant noodles were good after it soaked up all the sauce
* When you are 80% done, ask for your rice to be cooked and they will do it for you
* I love the crispy bottom part of the rice


Summary: I would go back to Joons, but would order things differently. I would get the Suicidal spicy sauce (although it sounds scary, Original spicy is not spicy at all) and would skip the mozarella cheese. Also, keep in mind that once you start adding extra things, your bill will end up higher than you expect...but again, since when was Korean food cheap in Canada? Overall I enjoyed the food here and the service is decent. Would def go back!",['dakgalbi'],1

I swear my pork bone soup went bad already. The moment the server put the soup on my table i already smelled the non-freshness. It smelled terrible!

I'm like OK, but this just taste wrong. Then he told me his boss tasted the soup and it tasted perfectly fine, and just left. Well I don't know what the owner eat every day that he thinks the soup that went wrong already taste fine, but i have a normal person's taste so I'm not OK with this shit.

The marinated pear had a lot of flavor even when fold. And the noodles were chewy yes yes!

Pros: 
- I always get the pan dish and add ramen, octopus and pork! Extra additions that are great include rice cakes, ramen, and cheese! 
- Also recommend getting the Kimchi Fried Rice! It's not to spicy and full of that kimchi flavour. 
- Quick service. The servers are so nice and always come and greet you right away which I really appreciate. 
- Appetizers: The sweet mashed potatoes are so good and the kimchi is not to spicy. Wish they sold it on the side so I can buy some to take home. 

Cons:
- Although I love the dish, sometimes I feel like it is a little pricey for the amount that you get
- There is never any free parking and if you choose to pay for parking, the lot behind charges about $2-3/ per half an hour.

314,3814,4335,l3lzPkbXKguqvO85rblTJw,Joons Restaurant,3,"A must-try at Joon's is the DakGalBee because not a lot of Korean restaurants actually offer it. It was the first time my three friends and I tried it. 

It's a good idea to arrive around 6:00 to 6:30 p.m. on weekdays for dinner because it starts getting busy at 7:00 p.m., and it might be hard to get a table around that time or later. Groups of people kept coming in. Also, the service is a bit slow (took around 20 minutes or so for our food to arrive), so the long wait won't be very pleasant.

We ordered the regular DakGalBee and HaeMool DakGalBee with a total of four servings (two per entree). Unfortunately, most of my group of friends, myself included, cannot eat spicy food, so we decided to get the teriyaki sauce. If you can eat spicy food, I highly recommend the Joon's original spicy sauce since it would've definitely enhanced the flavours. I felt that the teriyaki sauce made the DakGalBee taste pretty ordinary, so I was definitely not blown away. I actually disagree with some of the Yelpers below because I felt that the servings were pretty normal. I didn't think that they were small at all, and all the add-ons were plentiful.

Furthermore, the DakGalBee only comes with the meat, seafood, and assorted vegetables, so the extra add-ons are a must. It's a bit disappointing since the entrees are already around $10 itself, and each add-on is $2.00, except for the steamed rice (around $1.50) and fried rice ($2.50). Also, each add-on's cost is per entree, so since we ordered two entrees, it was $4.00 for each add-on (which was pretty pricey). If you want to be full, you have to get either the rice or rice cakes. We got the rice cakes, mozzarella cheese, and noodles. Overall, the meat and seafood were fresh, the rice cakes were soft, the mozzarella cheese was almost just as good as the cheese from a pizza parlour, and the noodles did not seem overcooked. The side dishes were also very fresh; I really enjoyed the sweet potato salad.

I would definitely come again to eat the DakGalBee even though it is a bit pricey. The dish itself was really filling, and the flavours were quite good.",['dakgalbi'],1

The total came out to be about $11 per person before tax and tip.

Here is why i rated this restaurant very low:

1. The dish is called Spicy Chicken (Dak Gal Bi), but you barely get any. I think I counted about 7 small pieces per person. Maybe they should rename the dish... to Spicy Noodles with Chicken. Also the chicken was bland. I'm pretty sure it was not marinated, but rather raw chicken cooked first, then sauce added on top.

2. There were barely any other ingredients - not much cabbage, green onions, etc. The dish is predominantly Instant Noodles and rice cakes. This is fine and dandy, but for $11, it is not worth it at all. I mind as well make my own instant noodles for $1, and order KFC. You'll get alot more food.

3. Service was bad - I had to call for the waitress multiple times. I went on a Saturday night (9 PM), and the restaurant was only 33% full.

4. Before anyone judges my review as too critical, I'm Korean and I cook/order Dak Gal Bi frequently. Also normally you get alot more chicken and vegetables, with noodle as a side and not the main. If the instant noodles is the main, then $11 is a rip off.",['dakgalbi'],0

banchan has the usual napa cabbage kimchi, beansprouts, but the one i especially like is their simple but good steamed broccoli with a dash of gochujang. personally i like gochujang with everything, but it may not be fore everyone. they also have a mashed potato banchan which i did not try.

if your order the dak galbi, i recommend extra orders of tteok (rice cake sticks), sweet potato and pumpkin. cheese (looks and tastes like mozzarella) is offered too, giving it a fusion/modern twist. ramen is also on the menu.

My mom and I had to walk out because we found it very pricey for two people, so this time we enlisted one more person to go with us.

For starters, the minimum order is 2 and each option (chicken, chicken and seafood, pork and baby octopus or beef and baby octopus) ranges from $13.50-14.50ish. We got the beef with baby octopus which is the most expensive one, with the original joons spicy sauce. I should also mention that you can't mix and match which is a big let down. Each add on (e.g. we got ramen noodles, cheese, rice cakes) is 2.25 Each, more or less depending on what you get. 

Presentation is cool but honestly the taste was very underwhelming. The flavour was just very monotone, everything tasted the same and had a very strong old cabbage bitter flavour.

At the end with tax and tip I paid about $45.  You're paying a lot for very simple and cheap ingredients with your hard earned money. What I am trying to say is, you can make something similar for way cheaper and taste wayyy better.

All the add-ons are not expensive ingredients, but the price can definitely add up per person. If you don't do the add ons, then you don't really have much of a dish. If it's not out of convenience for me, I would prefer venturing down to Yonge and Finch for better Korean food options (at a tad better price points).",['dakgalbi'],1
325,3825,4346,xVV86BToDOQGxE1gt9MMvg,Joons Restaurant,2,"If you come here, you need to get their dak gal bi which is table cooking chicken. But if you like other korean stuff like pork bone soup or whatever, they have those too. This place gets packed pretty quickly on a busy day so be prepared to wait. 

dak gal bi is $9.25 per portion but you need to order a minimum of 2 portions. Table cooking isn't really meant for an individual. It's for 2 or more people. The $9.25 is the basic which includes the chicken, sauce, and some veggies. You'll probably need to top it off with some extras like rice cake, ramen, or rice. Some of these extras are cooked within the pot. 

Like other reviewers said, I find their portions smaller than I expected. But it's not a major thing as it's only slightly smaller than expected. With 2 people you should get some extras if you don't want to be hungry afterwards. 

i like how you can specify the spiciness. If you don't ask, they will give you default which is not very spicy at all. 

Overall it's a solid place for the dak gal bi. I haven't tried other things of the few times I've been here.",['dakgalbi'],
326,3826,4347,zyg4-MFtfPWmwucVazSjfw,Joons Restaurant,3,"They have traditional Korean dishes and then there's the huge pots u see on everyone's tables. So how it works is you order per person. So if you're 3 people, you'll order 3 orders/person of one pan you all decide on unless u all want different ones (they have seafood chicken and beef to chose from). I dislike how you can't order extra noodles which I guess makes sense because they say it's per person but the portions here are so tiny. I'm not exactly sure how they are portioning but it's never enough and actually very little, although very good which is why we always return despite the tiny portions. So you don't necessarily have to order noodles either. Some people just get the proteins with the sauce. After your done eating it, save a bit of sauce and protein etc left and order fried rice. You pay based on bowls or per person. It tastes like bibimbap. I'm giving this place 4 stars because it is delicious and I always return. Would be 5 stars but they lose one due to tiny portions and being a bit pricy for the amount of noodles you get, which isn't filling.",['dakgalbi'],0

Anyways, it was a life changing experience because now that's all I crave, haha. I definitely need to try more but Houston doesn't have too many variety of Korean foods. I'm trying not to fly back just to eat there without my boyfriend knowing.. I'm kidding.

Let's skip to the important things like dakgalbi. One order was perfect for two people. You get to choose what you put into your dakgalbi so we added one serving of Ramen which clearly wasn't enough. That's all I was picking at! I added rice cakes, chicken, and cheese! We only added cheese to half of the order and it was definitely enough for that whole pan. It was a bit too cheesy but my boyfriend loves it like that so I wasn't mad. The taste was not anything crazy but I'm a pretty plain person so I don't expect anything blasting with flavor. I don't even dip my chicken nuggets most of the time so that tells you a lot about my poor taste buds. A++ for that amazing dish. I can't stop thinking about it. I think I need some serious help. 

The service was great! The lady that helped us was super nice! The place gave me a nice and warm feeling to be at on a super cold day. I was desperate to go back for my last meal in Toronto but I really didn't want to drag my luggage everywhere on the subway and what not. Now I regret not doing that...

Pros: 
- very nice waitresses
- they have booths with grills designed in the table (uber cool) 
- novelty idea: the waitresses cook right at your table (if you're sitting in a booth)! 
- GET IT WITH CHEESE! :D
- I'm always full, if not completely stuffed, after a meal at Joon's! 

Cons: 
- if you're seated on tables, you don't get to see the waitresses cook in front of you. They tend to cook at one table and bring the pan to you later...not cool  :( 
- if you're getting the entrees which they cook in front of you, you have to order 2 of the same dish which generally leads to less choice/variety 
- they only accept debit or cash 

I actually didn't realize this until lately, but what they cook in front of you can be easily replicated at home. Nonetheless, it is pretty good food.",['dakgalbi'],1

-Do NOT order the dumplings - they tasted of freezer burn and were plated on stale cabbage. Pretty sure they have been sitting in the freezer for months.
-The restaurant was dirty. There were so many flies & fruitflies landing in our food.

I was a bit worried I wouldn't be able to tolerate the spice of the famous dakgalbee dish, but it wasn't too bad. We were a party of four, so we got two portions of the seafood and chicken versions, topped with their original sauce, mozzarella cheese, and rice cakes. I think the cheese helped tone down the spiciness, so it's a good addition if you have low spice tolerance like me.

Of course I always order the dakgalbi which is what Joons is known for! I've ordered either the chicken or beef option and both were delicious. I always add in cheese, rice cake and ramen noodles. The portion may seem small at first but towards the end me and my friends/family always struggle with finishing it. I've tried the steam dumplings a few times and it was amazing too. My mouth is watering just remembering my last meal at Joons!

I find it kind of odd that you have to order at least 2 portions of the dakgalbi but in the menu they give the price for just 1 portion. I recommended Joons to a friend and she told me she didn't realize she had to order 2 so she was super confused when she got her bill! I must imagine they get quite a bit of confused customers at the check-out.

I love the flavor cause it's spicy enough without me having to drink water after every bite. One thing is.... Lots of cabbage in the dish. I don't mind cause I love cabbage but my friend was picking then out and he had a bowl full of them lol 

Service was a bit slow even though it wasn't that busy. We asked for a refill on side dishes which took a long time to arrive and we had to ask 3 times. It also takes a while for the dishes to arrive so this wouldn't be a good place to go if you're in a rush.

I entered this restaurant and was directed to sit down. No hello No good evening. I should have taken the welcome or lack of one as a sign. 

When the menu was placed in front of me I was given 30 seconds to order. I felt rushed and pressured. 

So I ordered my dish then before I can continue my beverage and app order she took a step away as if she's in a rush and I'm slowing her down. 

Long story short she got my order wrong. I knew she got my order wrong because she gave me no time of day to listen to me and to allow me to properly order. 

When I proceeded to tell her my order was wrong she said I don't need to pay for it if I don't like it. 

All this while the owner just stood there cooking her lunch on a portable grill. 

I am not expecting the world when it comes to food and service In a Asian quick service restaurant but this was ridiculous. 

Joons is great for a hearty well priced quick meal. But not if you wish to be treated like crap.

Atmosphere: Very casual, good for large groups as well as quick dinners.

Service: Usually adequate, they can rush you if it's busy. On my last visit, they didn't rush us out of our table, but it did feel like they needed the serving ware (large pan to used for the Dak Gal Bi) back. They do accepts credit cards.

Food: My order is usually the same, Dak Gal Bi with ramen, sweet potato, rice cake and cheese. The orders aren't cooked at your table anymore and instead the server uses a nearby empty table. The large pan is served already cooked and ready to eat. Side dishes are standard of kimchi, bean sprouts, turnip and mashed potato. I do like the mashed potato a lot as it's sweet.

For the Dak Gal Bi, the chicken, cabbage and base are very flavourful. I wish they were more generous with the toppings as it seems like I could always eat more of the ramen or rice cake. Maybe I'm just too slow and my fellow diners have already scooped them up.

The Dak Gal Bi has a minimum of 2 orders/pan. I find if you're not ordering anything else, 1 order/person is just right.",['dakgalbi'],1

Other than the two ceiling fans and the one small air conditioner near the entrance, I found it to be very humid and this ruined the experience for me.
The menu also seems to have changed since the last time I was there (a couple of months ago). The dakgalbi dishes now require you to place a minimum of 2 orders per dish, which can be quite pricey, considering the popular add ons - rice cakes, noodles and cheese, are an additional ~$2 each. Portions are also slightly on the smaller size for the price you pay. 
The servers were pleasant but service in general was a little slow. We didn't get our appetizers until we asked them (30 minutes after we ordered) and it took about 40 minutes for us to get our food... the place wasn't even packed!

Meh... Nothing special, the place is not decorated at all, minimum effort. Reminds me of an old fast food restaurant.

Service: 2.5
Service was very mediocre.  There were 2-3 girls working in the front and approximately 3-5 more tables of 2-4 people during our time there and food still took FOREVER to get to us. Water was quick, but everything else including side dishes took forever. Considering that it was not a very busy night and it still took a while, i can't imagine the service when it is busy. 

Food:  3.5
The taste was alright. We ordered two orders of DakGalbee. Their min. was 2 orders which i found kind of stupid because i definitely wanted to try other things as well but didn't want too much food. When the food came, my finance's first reaction was is that one order or two? (I'm sure you can imagine the portion now) For the price of $12.50 for one order it was definitely not worth it. It only includes chicken and cabbage. We had added ramen and cheese($2 each) and even with those added, the dish was tiny. The side dishes was very mediocre- We had kimchi, potato (very good and creamy), radish and broccoli. 

Overall:
The food was okay, not worth it though for the price we paid. We paid over $30 including tips and for what we had- it was not worth it. We haven't tried DakGalBee in Toronto yet but we ate quite a bit of it when we were in Korea and can't compare.",['dakgalbi'],0

We ordered 3 portions for 4 people and boy, we were full by the end. It was a good amount split between 4 people. We were struggling to finish it! It was not overly spicy however, it was a bit salty. Overall, it was a tasty and satisfying meal! Very affordable - about 10 bucks per person. Prior to our Seafood DakGalbee, side dishes were served. We had the mashed potato, kimchi, seaweed and sweet-sour radish. Honestly, the side dishes were not the best compared to the ones I've had at other Korean restaurants.

One thing that was pretty disappointing was the wait time for our food. It took forever for our food to arrive. We waited for at least 30mins and all we had on our table was water... However, they do give you a new bottle of water without you having to ask for it every time when its empty.

Overall, I'd come here again just because DakGalbee is so BOMB!!",['dakgalbi'],1
366,3866,4387,uJ8AN83o7RT0UU0xIa8jOw,Joons Restaurant,4,"This isn't the first time I ate at Joons, but it would definitely be my last. The only reason I still eat there despite its horrible service and selection of appetizer is because of their table cooking. I'll admit, I like their table cooking selections (I personally go for the chicken one) and along with that I always add a few side dishes to add to it. My typical selection is cheese, noodles x2 since we have two people and sweet potato. As usual, I ordered this except this time the waiter told me in half-understandable English that I can only order one noodle, even if I want to pay extra for it. Okay? So you don't want my money? And what kind of policy is it to not let customer order what they like? Fine, I got over that since it's not such a big deal. As usual, the appetizers did not come until nearly 20 minutes later. And no, asking them for it would not make it any faster. Infact, they had it on the counter all along but still didn't want to give it to you. I can confidently say this is their way of doing things because all four times I went, things never improved. The appetizers consist of: two pieces of broccoli, half a scoop of potato, some kimchi and a few beans. Every time I see it it just makes me not want to go back. Onto the horrendous main course that used to be good: Table Cooking. We decided to try something new today: Tofu Table Cooking. Everything seemed normal until we took a bite at the tofu, it was incredibly sour, not what a NON-EXPIRED tofu should taste like. YUCK! There is a saying that restaurants that are afraid of letting customers eat would not stay open for long, as they oppose the fundamentals of even opening a restaurant. DEFINITELY not recommended!",['dakgalbi'],0
367,3867,4388,lXjgtWP8RdP7LmsZmosdxQ,Joons Restaurant,2,"Come for the table top set, left happy.

The table top set that we got was just chicken (there are different varieties) and you get to customize what goes in it (we got rice cake and mozzarella cheese).  The food was good, although it wasn't quick since they cook it in front of you (well, not really, there seemed to be a dining table that was dedicated to cooking it in the dining area).

The side dishes here are lacking compared to Nak Won, here you get broccoli, mashed potato, kim chi and radish.  None of which are memorable.

Cost was $27ish after taxes for two people.  I'd come back for the table top set again although the portion is not really that large, so you may want to add some more things.",['dakgalbi'],0
368,3868,4389,sTuodNPVIEdJa99kRFimjA,Joons Restaurant,4,"I really wanted to adore this place since I had been eyeing it for a while and a friend had hyped it up, so I stopped by on my birthday. First of all, the seating is extremely cramped. The entry way itself, you have to push past lines of people to get out which, after trying the food, I couldn't really fathom why. We really wanted to try the dakgalbi, their speciality, but we were told we couldn't get that unless we ordered TWO of those. Ridiculous! After waiting in line so long and to be forced in to trying to get two huge portions simply for two people is crazy. Maybe the line up was because they try to enforce this rule and so people come in big groups which I think is absolutely silly. We were already here and waited so long that we didn't want to leave. Seeing what little options we had other than the dakgalbi should have been our next clue to leave. 

In the end, we opted for a ramen and a soup - both of which were doused in spice, and extremely watered down. Don't get me wrong, I'm South Asian so you know for a fact I'm not afraid of spices whatsoever but it was so much that all you could taste was the spice and nothing else. You literally could not taste anything else, no kimchi, none of the vegetables, not even salt. The ramen was a seafood ramen, but I got a total of one piece of (frozen, still cold) shrimp and two minuscule pieces of mussel. And that was just my ramen! My friend's soup was watered down, and again, all you could taste was tomato and the spiciness. Not even the rice it came with could make it better. 

The cheapness of the dishes should have been a reflection of the food and we should have stayed away, however it was because it was all so cheaply priced that we didn't feel that ripped off walking out of. The side dishes were also disappointing, specifically the sweet potato mash although it was nice to try a texture different than water. The cleaniless is also another topic on it's own. Flies were flying around and everytime I opened my mouth, I was afraid I would accidentally swallow one so I was consciously minding each bite which is a red flag of it's own. We didn't even finish, paid and simply left. All around disappointment. Stay far, far away especially in such an abundant place like North York where Korean places are a dime a dozen.",['dakgalbi'],0

We ordered the beef dumplings and Jjeesong bulgoli. The dumplings were okay, but not flavor to them. The bulgoli was difficult to eat because we did not know how to eat it.

My friend who I went with does not eat spicy so we ordered it with a non-spicy sauce. It was great that they have a non-spicy option, otherwise I wouldn't get to try this dish since you have to order at least two portions. We had the one with no seafood and added sweet potato and noodles. We didn't order rice cake, but it came with it too, not sure if there's any to start off with. Although I think the dish will taste a lot more delicious with some spicy sauce, but without it it still taste awesome! The sauce they used was just addicting...kind of like a thick Teriyaki sauce. I also loved the chicken and chewy rice cake. 

I love how they cook it in front of you, which just gives a warm feel of great service. The waitresses there are also very polite and considerate. For appetizers, they have mashed potatoes served like a scoop of ice cream and green seaweed seasoned with black pepper.

Their pork bone soup was very peppery and otherwise seemed a little bland. Perhaps it was just that day. It seems very busy there and many people looked like regulars EDIT: I think it was by the day because the next time I tried it again and it was delicious!

The food was fantastic, the service could have been better. We had to ask for water more than once, and the waitress had trouble understanding our order because English wasn't her first language. Then again, I guess you can't expect it ALL at an authentic Korean restaurant in Koreatown. 
My only disappointment was that they wouldn't mix the rice in with the chicken, the way it's supposed to be! It could also be because the waitress couldn't understand me.",['dakgalbi'],0
381,3881,4402,orh0HRUNCWuQMt9Iia_osg,Joons Restaurant,3,"Seen a lot of my friends post pictures of this place (very excitedly) on Facebook. Also been recommended to come, so I came with my parents.

I'm going to start with the upsides. The two main servers speak fluent English. Major plus. They have two free parking spaces in the back (which they let more than two cars park in...). Also a plus. Biggest plus of the night is that they did not spill stuff on my jacket (see my review on Oh Geul Boh Geul, which I would rather go to than here still...)!

The meh's: The food was pretty decent, but nothing to write home about. We ordered two portions of the dak gal bee with seafood ($11.75 or so per portion). Seafood is mussels, baby octopus and something else I can't remember. We then added noodles (ramen - $2) and at the end, fried rice ($2.50). I had heard that the portions here were small, but I was hoping for the best. I hoped that with the side dishes, there would be enough for the three of us. Turns out I was woefully mistaken. Should have figured that one out by the number of (not) doggy bags the other customers had. The portions were not tiny, but they were definitely not generous portions. There were only four side dishes (kimchi, sweet potato mash, seaweed salad, pickled carrots and radish), and each came in tiny portions. Most ice cream scoops I've had are bigger than that scoop of sweet potato mash. Thankfully, they did allow us a refill. I was super excited for the fried rice, because the menu says that at the end, they put the rice in for you, add sesame oil and seaweed, then mix it up with the remaining sauce and stuff at the bottom of your pan. As soon as I saw the pan (before they put the rice in), I knew this was going to be sad. There was very little sauce to begin with. I mean, it coated what was in the pan, but unless they added more sauce (which they probably did), there would not be enough for the rice. The rice was NOT worth it. Buy a bowl of steamed rice ($1.50) and mix it in yourself. It's cheaper and pretty much the same. I detected a hint of sesame, but I couldn't find any seaweed. The fried rice aside, for two portions of seafood dak gal bee, there was only 1 mussel. Does this mean that each portion only gets 1/2 a mussel? The logic there makes me sad.

The downsides: Menu is quite limited. I prefer restaurants where I can order a zillion different things to eat. Already mentioned the portions above. Will reiterate. At a lot of Korean restaurants where you do your own table top cooking, or share an entree, especially those that say they're for two people, there's usually a lot of food (like enough to feed 3 hungry people or 4 average/small eaters). This was enough for two. We were going to order a bibimbap, but when we placed the order, the server came back to us immediately and apologized that they were out of cooked rice for which to make our bibimbap. This was at 7:15pm. This has never happened to me before. An Asian restaurant running out of cooked rice... wow. They were making more, but we did not want to wait for it. My parents were satisfied (as in no longer hungry), but I was about 55-60% full. 

Total damage for the night: $30 and a bit after tax but before tip.

Will I come again? Probably not voluntarily.",['dakgalbi'],0

A bit of spicy Korean was definitely in order given the -10째 weather. Even though Joons is known for their dakgalbee, an awesome carb-y combo of rice cake, cheese, and rice and/or ramen, we opted against it this time around so they wouldn't have to go back into the office smelling like spicy cheese. Instead, we ordered the vegetable soft tofu soup, bulgogi noodles, and the spicy chicken rice. My friend originally wanted to warm up with some pork bone soup, but they didn't have it ready yet when we got in shortly after 11:30. We were told the wait would be about an hour for it, which I guess is a mixed blessing as any soup that takes an hour plus to prepare must be relatively authentic. The food was pretty good, but the conversation was better. My favourite was the spicy chicken rice and Joons' mashed potato side dish. Prices are great, lunch for under $15 with tax and tip, but they don't accept credit here, only debit and cash.

I've always ordered it with the Joons special sauce, but I think next time I go I will try the spicy sauce for once.  I'm actually not the biggest fan of the rice cakes there as I find them a bit plain - the noodles with mozzarella cheese have much more chewiness to them as well as flavour.  There's definitely a good amount of meat that comes with the combo, sufficient for two hungry souls on a cold winter day.

We enjoyed our dinner here! We went for the ever popular spicy chicken Dakgalbi and added rice cakes, extra vegetables, cheese and ramen noodles (add-ons are $2.25 each). 

You have to order at least two portions of the dakgalbi which starts at around $11.00 each x 2. We thought the add-ons are multiplied by order but surprisingly they were not. Our meal for two came to around $40 including tax and tip. 

The flavour was great, if you love spicy food, I definitely recommend the spicy original sauce, they have an even spicier version but I found the original to be spicy enough. I'm glad we also had the banchan which were above average, especially the potato salad and pickled radish which were welcoming additions to the spicy chicken. The portion is good for two, we managed to finish almost all of it, with some cabbage and pieces of chicken left over. The rice cakes were my favourite, they were chewy and delicious in the spicy sauce, I'd say it's a must-add! We did find that it gets a bit boring after a while that's the only downfall with this type of 'two orders minimum' style of dining. I would understand if they were serving in one of those hot plates on a burner but it was just a large dish that could have easily been split into two individual portions. I saw some pictures of the burners but I guess they've phased that out, maybe it's time for a menu update as well! 

The service was really good, the food took a bit of time to come out but it wasn't unreasonable. Water refills and banchan refills were offered regularly which was great because the food was spicy! The waitress was sweet and attentive. They seemed genuine and appreciative of our business which is always nice.

I always get the Dak Gal Bee (either JS1 with chicken or JS2 which has addtional seafood) and enjoy both. I see many others complaining about the size of the portions, but I find them to be enough. Two portions for two people for lunch was more than sufficient, and even two portions for three people for dinner plus a side of dumplings was fine too. The best way to enjoy this dish: make sure you add on rice cakes, cheese and instant noodles. The rice cakes are deliciously chewy, and the instant noodles help soak up all the extra sauce (made the mistake of not getting noodles the first time, and it was just way too saucy and salty.) Plus you just can't go wrong with extra cheese. :D While some traditionalists might argue that this isn't the most authentic way to enjoy Dak Gal Bee, I still say the add ons are what make the dish good here!

You know those seafood medleys that come frozen at the grocery store? I think mine was made of that. There was one calamari ring, three mussels and one dried up shrimp. LOTS AND LOTS OF ONIONS. 

Oh and the side dishes?!? What on earth is happening. I've never seen side dishes so garbage before. Not to poop on a place but kimchi, radish, mashed potatoes and broccoli with hot sauce on top doesn't sound right. Where's the seaweed, beans and sprouts.

We ordered two orders of spicy chicken & seafood with cheese and rice cake add on, and with their signature joons spicy sauce, as well as an order of soon do boo. 

It took a while for the food to come out, and the small side dishes were of super tiny portions and lacked variety. They also did not come before the meal like most other Korean restaurants and came with the main...we were already starving ! Weird backwards Korean cuisine imo

The spicy chicken and seafood was disappointing, the dish came out luke warm, and cooled down really quickly. The ingredients also only constituted a very thin layer in the pan.. literally covered only 2cm of it. There was no heating element underneath to keep it warm, the chicken taste was mediocre at best and not very tender and I cant really tell the difference between the regular spicy sauce and their signature join spicy sauce.   Soon tofu was also average, in taste.

We decided to try the seafood and chicken dakgalbi and it was delicious! They could add a bit more seafood but we added in noodles so that filled us up. We also got the rice cakes- they were SPICY, soft yet chewy at the same time. One of the best rice cakes I've ever tasted. 

Just a note: you can order rice and they will make fried rice for you with whatever is left over- but you HAVE to have some leftover sauce and stuff in order to do it! What's nice is that they do it for you- excellent service!

Would definitely recommend Joons if you're in the area or craving some delicious dakgalbi.",['dakgalbi'],1
417,3917,4438,Wu0yySWcHQ5tZ_59HNiamg,Joons Restaurant,4,"It's smart they didn't bring BOWLS out to us first.  If they did I'm pretty sure my Friend would have started grabbing at the Dak Gal Bee prior to safe edibility while the Staff comes over to check on the doneness or replace the Gas Canister on our Portable Stove.  Yeah, some of my Friends are willing to risk Salmonella they're that hungry and rushed.

JS2 [Chicken & Seafood(Shrimp, Mussel, Squid) Dak Gal Bee]  
Add-on: Rice Cake($2.00) + Steam Rice($1.75?)

First, due to the Pan that the Dak Gal Bee($10+/portion) is cooked on.  It was difficult to see if our Pan had 2-portions or 3-portions(chosen).  I looked across to the Pan of a couple young Men(2-portions) and looked approximately the same as ours.  I'm thinking that on average we can blow through 1.5 - 2.0 portions per person.  That's probably why the young Men next to us ordered Soon Tofu as well.

If you are eating solely Dak Gal Bee only:

1 Hungry Patron    =  2-portions
2 Hungry Patrons  =  3-portions

Another option is add ALL the add-ons(Rice Cake, Noodle, etc...) which would total about the same price as an individual Dak Gal Bee portion.  So the question to the Hungry, do you want more MEAT or more Noodle/Rice?

As for the Dak Gal Bee itself, considering this as a homestyle Korean meal that includes Chicken(Meat), Cabbage/Scallions(Vegetable), Gochujang, it satisfies the basic needs of the average growing Teen.  The Dish itself is 1-dimension in terms of Flavour(Gochujang) but I guess that's the idea behind this Easy-to-Prepare Meal.

We chose the Joon's Original Spicy which was perfect median level spice.  The thing I like about the Dish is the Squid Tentacles, Dark Meat Chicken, chewy Rice Cake while I was a bit disappointed that each of us only received a single Mussel as well as Shrimp.  Depending on how much you love Gochujang, you might enjoy the leftover Gochujan Concoction.

I see why they say MINIMUM 2 portion because that's probably my standard portion size when I visit next time.",['dakgalbi'],1

If you want your usual gamjatang or soon tofu or kalbi beef, don't come here for it, they are best for dak gal bee!

I recommend getting the Seafood Dakgalbee, which comes with chicken (boneless dark meat), assorted seafood (baby octopus, shrimp, mussels), and cabbage. Tastes so so SO good!!! A downside to the Dakgalbee order is that you have to order at least 2 portions, so you can't really get an individual sized meal for this. You also have to pay $2.00 for each add-on, with options such as: rice cakes, mozzarella cheese, and ramen noodles, which are all MUST HAVES in my opinion. Brings the bill up a bit, but still a decent price for the portion you're given. I usually go with one other friend, and we're able to finish the whole dish feeling very full and satisfied! 

The service is kind of slow, but everyone is really nice. They have a few neat kiddish paintings and quotes on the walls as well, which makes the place look all cutesy! Definitely a go-to for me if I'm looking for a nice, filling meal with lots of variety.",['dakgalbi'],1

I've been to this location of Joon's before and I've had similar experiences, however, this time around, I think I have to reconsider what I think of Joon's.

I always order the Dak Gal Bee (JS1 or JS2, $12.50 and $13.25 per order) and there's a minimum order of 2. I always choose the Joon's original spicy sauce (decently spicy) and add rice cakes, cheese and ramen noodles. If I'm feeling especially hungry, I'll throw in a fried rice. All of these come at an add on price, ranging from $2.00 -$2.75.

For two people, we spent $38 after tips and taxes. For that price I think we could have had a much better meal in the area. I'm quite disappointed at how much I paid for... for a pack of ramen noodles and cheese with sauce.

There are no English name for this place in the advertisement my friend shown to me in a Chinese Newsapaper and there of course no Chinese name... Just 2 Korean word Plus...the map on the ad is not too helpful showing it as North of Weldrick!!

The only Chinese characters you will find are at the outside of the store prompting their BBQ Eel which is their speciality. Jang Uh Plus is runned by a Korean family, fortunately the owner speaks English well so I have no problem when I try to order. There are few English words in the menu itself but for the Combo Specials they are only in Korean.. funny thing is the word Soju kept popping up in their one page menu on their placemat and the wall..

They do order Lunch specials, which are $2 or so cheaper from 12-4 pm. I settle on the BBQ Eel + Dongchimi ($12.95). I don't know what is Dongchimi but I find out from the server is cold noodle soup.. that is perfect for me!

The order took 20 min to arrive! I was the first one that came in the restaurant and it was empty.. so it took that long for them to prepare my BBQ eel.. so don't come here if you in a rush!

The free appetitzer is deep fried fish.. normally I won't eat that since it is really a whole bait fish that deep fried without removing their heads and gut..and it can taste really fishy..but I ate both of them..they are pretty good to my surprise.

The BBQ eel is bbq until the skin is nice and crisp and brushed with hot sauce. It is a little bit spicy so if you cannot eat spicy ask them to take it easy on the hot sauce. The server explain to me that  Lettuce, shiso leaf, fresh garlic and ginger are on the side are for wrapping up the eel to eat it like a wrap. I usually hate eating fish skin because I find them fishy and I hate the texture.. but I love how their eel's skin here is so crispy, a little burnt.. and a little spicy!

The cold noodle tasted ok... not the best but I think I will order the EEl with rice instead. Or try one of their combo with Soju if I find out what their combos are!! :)

Indeed, you will find a selection of eight meats (ox tongue, marinated chicken lamb ALL YOU CAN EAT) and  many side dishes that are good enough to fill your glutony.

The Chinese waitress barely spoke French and English, so that created a little problem from the start.

The place  BADLY NEEDS a ventilation system, which is a must for a restaurant with mini grills on each table! There was a ventilator in the back which was blowing the smoke from all the tables toward the windows and the door. We came out of this place stinking off burn Chinese food. Had to go back to hotel, take a shower and change. 

As we got up to go to the counter and pay, a man and a woman (supposedly the family working in the restaurant) walked out from the kitchen and set down to eat at the first table next to clients!!! The only waitress/cashier joined them immediately!

When we got to the counter, we looked back at her, and she got up and run the credit card through, only to run back stick her face in a bowl of rice while the card was being processed. It really took 5 seconds or so, and here she runs back to check the printout. Unfortunately, the card did not go through, so she ran it again, and stormed back to the table to continue eating.

The place is always half empty. This time with road construction right outside and wide open door, the noise level is very high.  
The service was unsatisfactory. I came late at 2 pm. The only waitress already sat in the restaurant and have her big lunch with three other tables dinning and other people coming in.

Good meat variety (Ox, chicken, lamb), and a few sea foods (shrimp and salmon) are available.

Like all the Korean all you can eat you cooked your meat directly on your table.

Just make sure you're really hungry before you went to this restaurant and you'll be pleasantly pleased.

The d챕cor was clean. In the background was a television set with k-pop artists. I felt I was on a set of a stereotypical Korean drama. 

Our meal was delicious. The Banchan (side dishes) was fresh and vibrant. Our entree was tofu bibimbap and kimchi stew with pork. Both items were served with a healthy dose of purple rice. Our bibimbap was filled with bright vegetables; carrot, zucchini, cabbage, bean sprout to name a few and a perfectly fried egg on top. I adored crispy rice at the bottom of a scorching hot stone bowl. The kimchi stew has a great amount of smokey flavour. It complimented the rice well.

Initially we were looking at this sketchy looking place across the street with minimal decor (literally, one empty room with a couple tables and chairs set up), but we couldn't find it on yelp so we ended up looking at mama chef.

After being greeted at the door, we were brought into a room in the back, which I presume is their storage area since there were bags upon bags of rice, pancake mix, and other ingredients. It was an interesting decision since there were tables of 4 next to each other that they could have sat us at, but they decided to go with the VIP experience.

Washrooms are in the basement, and not very accessible. They were pretty standard for a washroom in koreatown. Don't expect much there.

We were offered some side dishes, along with two whole pancakes! Which is pretty crazy, cause some other places usually give you a few pieces, and some places don't even provide any. And they were full-sized pancakes, so this is a good start. The pancakes were pretty good too.

There weren't many utensils in the box, so we had to ask for more, but it was quickly provided.

The menu features a variety of options such as fried cutlets of meat, dumplings, bibimbap, pork bone stew, fried rice in stone bowls, hot plates, and table BBQ.

I ordered the fried rice with chicken in a stone bowl. It comes with the sweet/spicy korean sauce, so if you can't handle spice you might want to avoid this one. I enjoyed the flavour, though I would have preferred more spicy and less sweet. Price a bit on the higher end, but I guess that's where the pancakes come in.","['tteokbokki', 'gamjatang', 'bibimbap', 'mandu', 'yangnyeomchicken', 'pajeon', 'jajangmyeon', 'galbigui', 'friedchicken']",0

What I usually order:
- [No. 20] Spicy Rice Cakes with Noodles: Mildly spicy with tender rice cakes and noodles. Quite heavy to have it all in one go due to the thick rice cakes and noodles, so it's probably a good idea to share. 

- [No.6] Noodles with Blackbean sauce & beef dumplings: Small bowl of noodles for 1 person and 6 beef dumplings (if I remember correctly). I'm not a fan of the beef dumplings as I find the stuffing a bit tough for my liking. 

- [No.56] Fried Rice with Beef & Kimchi: Served in a hot stone pot perfect for chilly weather. I'm not sure if others have had the same experience, but when I had it the rice was overdone - a couple of burnt pieces making it real crunchy (I mean, if you like some texture in your rice, I suppose this does it...). I believe this was supposed to be spicy as well, but I didn't find it spicy at all especially when I'm sensitive to spices. So, if you want this spicy ask them to spice it up! 

- Side Dishes: They have 4 side dishes usually pickled cucumbers, kimchi, caramelized potatoes, spicy radish/pickled radish or fish cakes. 

Service: 
Very pleasant and usually speedy with orders. Sometimes I'd only see 1 person working the floor and that 1 person tries their best to accommodate a full house. 

Overall, love this cozy Korean restaurant. My favourite place for Korean food when I'm in the area. Will be back!","['tteokbokki', 'gamjatang', 'bibimbap', 'mandu', 'yangnyeomchicken', 'pajeon', 'jajangmyeon', 'galbigui', 'friedchicken']",1

It lacks the scorched black bean paste flavor and scent. Noodles are added into the bowl without being drained of liquid fully, making the sauce diluted. Veggies within the sauce has texture but lacks flavor. 

I also had Kaanpoonggi (spicy fried chicken/boneless chunks). In Korea there are regulations on meat ratio to batter and very picky/sensitive eaters so the restaurants have to abide by the rules, but this place seemed like it was majority batter and 30-50% meat(still better than Korea House couple blocks down, 0-20% meat). Sauce had too much oil, as if the fried pieces of chicken weren't drained before being satayed in the sauce.

If you enjoy over seasoned food beyond explainable pallette, this is a place for you. Or if you happen to be sick, and have a dull taste bud.

Our table of 4 ordered Combo D which feeds 4 to 6 people.

First came the Jap chae. It had greens which I was impressed. All of us took a bit to try, and we all were wah. Super flavour. Not only rich in sesame, but black pepper. Lots and lots and lots of black pepper. Each 4 bites, we had to take a sip of tea. 

Second came the beef boiled dumplings. Standard flavour, smaller then some I had. It was the best dish for the night.

Next came a chicken stir fried rice. They used they purple rice, was a bit wet and soggy. But it was edible. If you ever try stir frying rice out of the cooker with lots of condensation, you will understand the texture.

Next came the LA Kalbi. It came sizzling, it came black, it came charcoal. We all wanted to try to meat and took a bit. It was hard! Burnt bits crumbled in our mouth. The meat was tough and over cook it existence. We tried to send it back. The waiter said this is ordinary. The meat was so over seasoned and wet when grilled that the soya sauce just became grits and burnts on meat. I had never seen LA Kalbi disappear so slow on the table.. no one wants it. The cow died in vain.

Lastly came a kimchi pork sizzling dish. It sizzle nice, but very sour. It taste extra fermented and full of brine sourness. Imagine drinking a spoonful of pickle brine for fun. That's the flavour of the whole dish.  Our table was defeated. We pick out some pork and ate it. We lost our appetite. 

To top it off, we had leftover refrigerated cold soggy pancake for compliment appetizers.

At least the guava candy tasted good.

Sorry mama. I will not be back. Even myself, I think my cooking tasted better","['tteokbokki', 'gamjatang', 'bibimbap', 'mandu', 'yangnyeomchicken', 'pajeon', 'jajangmyeon', 'galbigui', 'friedchicken']",0

I also ordered their special which is the black bean noodles with a side of sweet and sour pork. I ordered it because their was a sign in their restaurant saying it's their specialty. I was so wrong. The noodles are spaghetti and the black bean sauce was not spicy and did not taste like black bean. I do not know what they used but it was not tasty. The sweet and sour pork looked really good on the wall. I thought it would look and taste very similar to the Chinese version of Sweet and Sour pork but as you can see from my picture it looked very interesting. They served the pork separately and you had to dip it into the Sweet and sour sauce. There was more batter than pork. My husband ordered the tofu soup and wasn't too amazed by it.

Therefore, we were a little disappointed in the food. I left without finishing the noodles because it was kind of gross. They have a wide selection in their menu but it was more or a miss than a hit. But like I said ordered their home made dumplings if you are to try this restaurant out.","['tteokbokki', 'gamjatang', 'bibimbap', 'mandu', 'yangnyeomchicken', 'pajeon', 'jajangmyeon', 'galbigui', 'friedchicken']",1

501,4001,4756,bZV2ug7-lfHipsIOo4z1ag,Spice Asian Kitchen,5,"Had my first experience at Spice Asian Kitchen last Wednesday for lunch. I have to admit I was kinda impressed. There were definitely some pros and cons.  I am in the restaurant industry myself so I have a tendency to view what's going on in a spot with a different set of eyes. 

First things first. This spot is the definition of curb appeal. The building is beautiful to pull up to. The entire Kingsley town center is gorgeous, but Spice Asian Kitchen stands out. Perfect placement, great color scheme, clean lines, modern and just beautiful. The theme continues inside. Whoever designed this place deserves an award nomination because it really is truly gorgeous. As far as dope decors go, they were able to execute a super sexy vibe while still being casual and approachable. Literally my perfect environment. Beautiful rooftop aas well.

When we arrived at the restaurant we were a little confused about which door to go through. I think that will be an ongoing issue for them. Maybe some kind of subtle signage would help, but it's not that big of a deal. When we came in there was no one at the host stand. We stood for a couple minutes admiring the decor before a server noticed us and went to find the hostess. We were promptly seated once she arrived and our server got to us right away. Server was super sweet and gave us some insight into the menu. Overall the servers seemed overwhelmed. They have a really solid lunch rush with everyone coming in from neighboring businesses. Seems like they are still finding their footing with handling that huge pop.

My girlfriend ordered a house made ginger lemon soda. It was really good. I just had sweet tea. We ordered a couple small plates to start. KFC wings and Szechuan Dumplings. I love the gochujang sauce on the wings and the texture of the wing is great. I do think the sauce could be a little better balanced, but I enjoyed them. The sauce for the dumplings is delicious and they were perfectly seared. Next we ordered Vegan Fresh Rolls add shrimp, Salmon Tacos and the Wagyu Burger. The Vegan Fresh Roll is basically a summer roll with a peanut dipping sauce. It was very good. The Wagyu burger is insanely delicious. I did not expect a burger in a Thai restaurant to be so good. It featured smoked gouda, bibb lettuce, pickled onions and a gochujang mayo. The bun on the burger was perfect and it all came together and melted in my mouth. The Salmon tacos sounded great, but we never received them. Our server forgot to ring them in and we didn't have time to wait. 

All in all it was a great meal. We will definitely be back with friends. I would love to see how this place looks at night. Love the vibe.","['mandu', 'bibimbap', 'gyeranfry', 'bulgogi', 'japchae']",1

Gratefully, this location is close to work and my friend suggested it for lunch.  I saying yesss, before she could finish because this place was on my wish list.  The reviews had me curious but it was the green curry that was the most tempting.  

When I told my coworker where I was going, she said, ohhh their green curry is really good!!  Will you bring me back the order of green curry with tofu?  
That did it.  I knew exactly what I was going to order with one minor difference - green curry with chicken, not the tofu.  Let me tell you that it did not disappoint.  The plan was to save some for later but before I knew it the bowl was dry.  The fortunate thing is my tiny coworker finished hers too.  This made me feel better about eating my entire bowl with the serving of rice to soak up the remaining green curry.  

The restaurant is located in the gem called Kingsley.  It is clever how the former Springs Mill is now a mixed-use but there is not enough parking during peak hours.  So be aware that you will have to hunt down a parking space.   

The inside of the restaurant is laid out well. The hostess stand is directly in front of you when you walk in the door and to the left is a couch and chair and additional seating outside should there be a wait.  The bar and seating is to the right and beyond that space is a small patio.  The place was packed at 12 noon and quickly emptied by 1:15.

Our server was not as attentive as she needed to be - we were in need of refills for the last part of our meal.  She brought the checks out, and the takeout order arrived before she returned to refill our drinks.

Spice is technically still in their soft opening/getting the hang of things mode, and their grand opening is going to happen in May 2019. Knowing that (and reading some of the other reviews), we set our expectations pretty low but were pleasantly surprised.

Parking is pretty easy since there are ample spots in the lots at Kingsley - at least there were around 6 pm on a Wednesday night. We were seated at a high top in the bar area, but there was also a rooftop bar, outdoor seating, and regular tables in the main restaurant. The bar was really pretty, and I sooo appreciated seeing purse hooks AND USB/outlets for phone charging. 

For dinner, we started with the dumplings - they were ok but definitely needed more filling. I got the chicken pad thai as my entree and thought it was really good. Pad thai is a bit of a taste preference, and I like mine on the sweeter side, which this one was. The fella got a poke bowl with tuna, which looked really bright and healthy. He thought it was great. 

We split the green tea tiramisu for dessert; it was so tasty and so light. He wanted to get a bourbon since Spice's selection was pretty impressive, but the bartender wouldn't sell him the ones they wanted because they were part of the owner's selection and just for show. Bad move. Don't display multiple bottles of alcohol you're not willing to sell just to look fancy.

Spice definitely lives up to its name because everything is spicy and flavorful. We had plenty for leftovers as well. After we went upstairs to check out the rooftop and grabbed a few more drinks. For a June evening it actually felt cool outside due to all the fans they have so we weren't uncomfortable and the bartender was great!

The restaurant has a great atmosphere. I understand if you're going for a trendier upscale experience, however even the nicest restaurants have options for kids (And this is Fort Mill where families want to go out with their little ones!) We were offered the $15 fried rice for our 2 year old (not happening!). You have rice, noodles, chicken, veggies, etc for your other dishes so it would be very easy to offer a small bowl for kids for $6/$7.","['mandu', 'bibimbap', 'gyeranfry', 'bulgogi', 'japchae']",1

Our waitress, Cynthia, was informative and helped us with the menu. The fresh rolls were pretty good, the chili peanut sauce made it better.

We also got the spicy edamame for an appetizer, and we cleaned the plate!

Yes, we have been a half dozen times in the short time they have been open.

They have craft beer on tap with local faves. Incorporating a happy hour will truly help with those getting off from work and wanting to chill a bit before heading home and picking up something different than pizza, burgers, or the standard American cuisine.  

Steve and Lei are the bomb and provide excellent service in the bar area. The owner is very active both behind the scenes and chatting with customers. Oh, they have take out too...just as tasty.

Upstairs area is really gonna make this place stand above the rest for sure. They planned well. The views are wonderful adding to the experience. The food prices are just a tad on the high end compared to other restaurants in Kingsley.

Reply to Manager's Response.  Thanks for the polite response to our comment.  To be clear, we were well aware that yours was not a traditional Chinese restaurant, as evident by the tacos, chicken sandwich and burger selections offered on the small one-sided food menu.  Also, we were certainly not looking for enough food to serve an Army, but rather enough to satisfy the average appetite.

The exterior, decor and vibe are perfection. The architect/designer did an incredible job. The bar seats are also super comfy and that's not something you can say often. The staff is very laid back. Not in a hurry and not very many of them. I'm glad I went on Cinco de Mayo when everyone was grabbing Mexican instead. 

I started with the dumplings. They were ok. Lots of dumpling and a lot less filling. Thankfully I opted for the oil on side because she said it was spicy. Both of the sauces were super spicy. It would be nice to have one that wasn't as spicy. The dumplings could have been seared a little more too. 

For my entree I went with the Pad See Yew. It was ok, but not worth the $16 price tag. Flavor was a little on the sweeter side, which I'm not a fan of, and the chicken was used sparingly. I also had two glasses of Prosecco with my meal and, with tip, I was over $55 for just me. I expected an upper $30 price tag, but for over $50, I could have had a much better meal elsewhere. 

I'm sure the place will attract a decent crowd because of location, convenience and a different flavor in the Fort Mill area, but don't count on anything that will wow you. Although it may wow your wallet.","['mandu', 'bibimbap', 'gyeranfry', 'bulgogi', 'japchae']",1

Instead, it was only sweet, and asking for spice (ironically) only left me with siracha to add.  I had the gyoza as well, which were fine, if you like sesame, but were under-seasoned, and again, lacked spice.

Second visit, I got a spice soda, green curry mussels, and Tom Kha soup.  Maybe I had high expectations, but I was underwhelmed.  The spice soda was highlight!  I got the honey orange- fresh, delicious and made on site. Highly recommend.  The Green curry mussels were fine- not best I've had. I like a crisp crostini and preferably
grilled but it was more on the soft side here. I also had to request a bowl for shells and a cocktail fork.  Minor things but take it from being 4-5 stars.  I've eaten Tom Kha soup at Rai Lay in South End- flavor out of this world so I had that expectation of similar experience and was far from.  Bummer.

This time I ordered the Beef short rib and it was excellent. Great flavor and cooked to perfection. I asked for no onions or scallions and just wanted the meat and they gave me 3 large thin sliced pieces. 
My dad got the ribeye rice bowl and he said it was also pretty good but the beef short rib was his favorite he kept stealing pieces of mine or the pieces of bone that you cut off. 
We tried dessert this time and got the green tea tiramisu and it was super light and tasty. They sprinkle it with a matcha powder which cuts the sweetness. 
We ended up sitting at the bar rather than a table. The table we were out at was right up near the front door and the bench where people sit to wait. There were a bunch of kids running around on the benches which was a huge turn off for that table so we decided to give our table up and just go back to the bar.

BUT there's many things to improve upon. We arrived at 11:20 , there were only 2 other people dining at the time.  Took 5 minutes for our server to come to the table . Her customer service was kind but she didn't seem like she knew what she was doing . The manager did explain she is new . 

My biggest gripe was our food took so long to come out. My colleague ordered the lunch Pad Thai and I ordered the Pad See Ew. Both were ok, there wasn't anything to brag about with these two dishes. The sauce was typical, however ; for $11 you expect more and an accompaniment of other ingredients in the dish . To wait 40 minutes for your lunch only to be greated by 95%noodles is a huge turnoff. On top of that we never got any water refills . With this being a new restaurant it would've been useful for the owner or management staff to walk around and greet the guest , maybe then the long waits for service and food could've been addressed proactively. 

The manager apologized and treated us to the meals , because on top of the long wait our tickets were miscalculated.  I thought that was good service, but not enough to make me want to come back and try another dish. From what I viewed from the menu , the prices are too steep for the quantity and quality .

Had a craving for some Asian food and thought of Spice located in Kingsley.
Kingsley is a newer area in Fort Mill that has several great restaurants, businesses, apartments and a hotel.  Great little area to get exercise, lunch, your nail/hair done and grab a drink.

Today we decided to head to Spice for lunch.  Wanted something tasty and good without the long wait.  With the day being beautiful, we decided to sit out side on the second floor.  Great view of the Kingsley neighborhood and the a slight breeze makes it just perfect.

So my colleague and I must have been hungry.  We decided to choose two appetizers.   The Roti Canai and the dumplings.  The Roti Canai was okay.  I've had many types and home made Roti Canai from Malaysian to Indian restaurants.  It usually has a slight crisp but ours was a big soggy.  The Roti Canai is accompany with curry sauce and to me it was not thick enough.   The thickness of the curry sauce is really needed in order to eat the Roti Canai.  Typically, I'm use to receiving a piece of Chicken and potato or vegetable in the curry sauce.  Barely anything with the curry sauce.  The Szechuan dumplings were amazing with a slight kick with the chili oil.  Definitely a recommend to try both appetizers when you get a chance to visit.

For the main course I opted for the Bibimbap.  A bibimbap is a hot stone bowl filled with amazing vegetable medley, bulgolgi and fried eggs.  Comes with a small bamboo for you to mix all that goodness in the stone bowl all together.  Each bite should have a little everything to create a umami taste that will explode in your mouth with every bite.  Now if you let the rice sit a bit longer on the bottom - it gets pretty crispy like chips.  Now if you like some heat with your bibimbap, it come with kimchi and gochujang sauce.  YUMMY!!!  My colleague decided to order the Seared Ahi Salad which looked amazing!  She finished her plate clean!

We definitely did not have any room for sweets or cocktails but all the more reason for us to come back next time.  Spice Asian Kitchen is great for everyone all around.  Highly recommend and I'm definitely looking forward to going back to try something new.","['mandu', 'bibimbap', 'gyeranfry', 'bulgogi', 'japchae']",1

Logistics: I walked over on my lunch but saw plenty of on street parking. 

Crowd: We came into a lite lunch crowd but that didn't last long. 

Staff: There were about 4 staff members at the hostess station when we walked in but perhaps because they were just opening. All very friendly! Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable. I asked and appreciated her recommendations. My friend didn't enjoy the Pad Thai and our waitress handled the situation. 

The Eats: I ordered the KFC wings which were perfectly fried, crispy but still juicy. The sweet and spicy flavors were a refreshing pop to the tastebuds! I also ordered the dumplings, which weren't my favorite but weren't bad. Next up was the salmon taco, now notice I said TACO. It caught me a little off guard that it was only one singular taco. However, it was delicious and the $4 price tag should have been a clue there would be only one (but I hail from TX where a $1 taco isn't rare lol). To wash this all down I had their Berry Mint Soda. It was lacking a little something'something but the mint came across loud and clear.

600,4100,4855,rv9d5TcnnxuOCX7ole_Clg,Spice Asian Kitchen,2,"This place could be so much better with a little more attention to detail from the leadership at this restaurant.

First off, the upstairs bar, dining area needs attention. The stools with no backs don't do anyone any good. They are uncomfortable and certainly don't create an environment where someone wants to linger. They do have them at the downstairs bar. The upstairs bathroom is a plus.

The menu is confusing, the 'lunch announcement' creates more questions than it answers. There is a number 11 but it doesn't specify that selections are $11 dollars. There is also a section that shows, choice of vegetables/tofu/chicken and then is says: + 2 beef, +3 shrimp, + 6 scallops but what does this mean? Well, it means the beef, shrimp and scallops are up charges but as for the vegetable, tofu & chicken, who knows? You can see the photo of the menu I added.

I had the salmon and bulgogi tacos, they are tiny and made with soft flour tortillas, even though the menu doesn't indicate that. They were tasty but left me wanting more, at $4 bucks each a little pricey for the portion size you get.

They tout the beautiful view of the lake from the upstairs but that is only if you are lucky enough to get one of the 5 tables that are along the high wall, otherwise you don't have that view from anywhere else upstairs, even if you are standing and trying to see it.

The other issue I had was with the HDTV. As with most bars, they do have a nice large HDTV behind the bar, at lunch time it was not on.
When I asked my server Lillie, if the TV was working she said, ' I don't have the remote'. She went on to say the remote was handled by the Manager who was downstairs. She offered to go down and get it, I said 'no, it's not that big of a deal'. Mr Manager, you should either have the TV turned on already or give the upstairs Severs access.

Lillie, my Server was nice, professional and had a great smile. I would return just because of how friendly & welcoming she was.

Overall, I thought the experience was good. I like the location and there is plenty of free parking. 

I also like the outside tables which is a great option when the weather is nice. They do have the space warmers upstairs if it get's too chilly.","['mandu', 'bibimbap', 'gyeranfry', 'bulgogi', 'japchae']",1

Good sign is that 98% of the clientele were Korean. They even thought we were Korean and started speaking to us in Korean! :)  AND... on a Monday night they were FULL! wow!

It's a totally open medium to large sized room. On one side and by the windows are the booths with ventilation systems, on the other side it seems there are almost private tables behind open partitions (?! didn't really investigate too much there) and in the center just tables (see pics though there's another row of booths on the right side of the pic that wasn't captured)

Banchan (side dishes) were good. 
I had a dolsot bibimbap, it was ok.
I liked K9 on the menu. I would order that again (just kind of like beef (stews) soup with some glass noodles/vermicelli inside and a bowl of white rice... I liked the sweetness of it).  

Would definitely go again and recommend this to people, especially those in the South. I believe I read they have a $15 AYCE lunch?! don't quote me though.

602,4102,4857,ObBAwzX20LSnPYt1BuXkkw,Koreana BBQ,5,"Team Fam came here for dinner and we ordered the BBQ For 3. Essentially, this comes with the following:
Green Salad
Soybean Soup (kind of like miso soup)
Yam Tempura
Seafood Pancake
BBQ beef, king rib, pork, spicy chicken, short ribs, mussels, prawns, and squid

The main attraction here is the BBQ and it is a massive set for three! Myfavourite parts of this dish were the spicy chicken (for its high spice level), the king rib (fall-off-the-bone essentially), and the beef (for its delicious marinade). The seafood was also pretty spot on and grilled to perfection. The sheer size of this is a challenge and our group of 3 was challenged well.

The other condiments were nice to have as a break from all the meat, and as with any Korean restaurant, there were also plenty of banchan (side dishes). These weren't as exciting but they were essential to the experience.

The Yam Tempura here deserve a special note. With their soft crisp and warm inside, the yam flavour is really distinct and the dipping sauce had a good concentration of flavour in it as well.

If I had to choose the least exciting thing here, it would be the Seafood Pancake. This would normally be the most exciting dish to have at a BBQ party, but here it was a little lacking in seafood with too much onion for my tastes.

But I find that the service and the food seems to be a bit irregular now.  I do like the food, but it's either like they changed chefs and I keep getting him alternately on vacation or at work.

It's also still a bit pricery than most of the Korean restos in town, but when they do hit their mark dead on, it's worth it.  

The staff seems to be a bit haphazard on the english comprehension, which I would have assumed was the most important part of serving an english based community.

Despite all these, the one thing that stood out for me in the whole meal was their rice! yea.... rice.   I expected the rice to be regular rice. but instead. they chose to use some wild rice which is a healthier choice! I liked that.

However the service here is very poor and it takes a while for the kitchen to turn out the food.  Ok when you want to just socialize but if you are hungry or have kids who need to eat right away, their level of service is in need of improvement.  Staff is friendly but they don't have enough staff and their turnover seems to be quite high.  
On the food side their BBQ meats are quite flavorful and their seafood pancake is delicious.   It seems like they may have just switched chefs as their food is off just a bit from previous visits.
For folks with allergies it isa bit dangerous due to the wait staff's translation issues.  
So the food is probably a four star but the service really pushes this down to a three at best.  If you can handle poor service but good food, then this is the place for you. 
Cheers and happy eating.","['bulgogi', 'galbigui', 'dakgalbi']",0

Great lunch specials for $5.55, including a drink...but not their Korean menu. We went for the Korean (ask for the special menu)...and we were not disappointed. I stuck with a traditional Korean favorite, Bibimbop. It was delicious! Swirl all the ingredients together and add some of their red pepper paste (which is really thick) and you've got yourself a hearty and scrumptious meal! Between my husband and I, we both agreed that the best part is the rice that cooked to the bottom of the hot pot...crunchy! By the way, I think it's genius to have it in a clay hot pot, every bite is just as hot as the first. 

Highlights of this restaurant: 
1. Like in many Latino establishments, they play novelas..here, they play Korean dating shows and Korean music.
2. If you are up to trying something new, no worries, they have a photo of every item on their menu. Point to order!
3. The booths are pulled away from the walls. Might not be a big deal to you, but it warranted a lunchtime conversation.

I know of maybe 4 or so, and driving up to China Wing you'd never really guess this has some of awesome Korean fare. From the outside it looks like yet another crappy, MSG-ridden, over-sauced American-Chinese hell hole. Even when you walk inside, you're still not totally sold you walked into the right place... 

Boy, are YOU wrong for thinking that! I've been here twice and both times I've been very impressed by their Korean food. I don't know how their Chinese or American dishes are since I never get them, but the Korean dishes are great!

This time I had the Dolsot Bibimbap and it was very well serviced. The cute cashier asked me if I'd ever had it before, to which I lied and said no. She gave me a very nice and friendly lesson on the dish, the name and what it means all while practically prepping it for me and serving it. She stirred my pot (no pun intended) and suggested how to eat it and what not. Very nice.

Before my Bibimbap arrived they bring out a bowl of shredded chicken soup, some kimchi and this sweet pickled radish with sugar which was out of this world.

So, all in all, it was a great visit, great food, great service and great info.

But let's knock off a couple stars.

One because I've had better Korean food and because when you first walk in, you can get a little confused between the Chinese and Korean and hamburger signs on the wall.

The second star was lost (and I'm being nice here as I usually knock off two stars for this sin) because they serve you unfiltered water. I HATE IT when a restaurant serves me unfiltered water. It's disgusting and unclean and it can ruin your meal. I only took a sip and thought about sending it back.

The Korean food here is good, even tho the actual restaurant is deceiving. I must say the bibimbap is better than any other I have tried in the Charlotte area. The bulgogi on the other hand, was good, just average. 

One thing I would recommend is to not go on your lunch break. With only 1 person serving the whole place and what seems like only 1 person making the entrees in the back, you're time does get very tight unless you call ahead.

China Wing looks like it used to be a Long John Silver or similar fast food joint. In order to make it the Korean owners serve a variety of American fast food in addition to the full Korean menu. You want the Korean menu, which has detailed descriptions of the dishes and photographs of most of the options, making it less intimidating for first-timers.

I was pleased with everything we ordered including the delicious Korean seafood and scallion pancake, the noodle dish japchae, the BBQ pork and the bi bimbap, a personal favorite. One disappointment was that the selection of banchan or panchan - tiny dishes, often pickled served with the meal - was limited to just 2: tasty kimchi and pickled radish. At other places (of course I'm comparing to Atlanta) you get at least 4-5 different options or possibly more. Still, I can't complain since the main dishes and the banchan we were given were delicious and definitely hit the spot and satisfied my craving for Korean food. I look forward to returning to China Wing and to visiting the other Korean restaurants in the area. I also look forward to visiting my favorite Korean spots back in Atlanta when we visit!

The fried dumplings were crispy, and the spicy sauce was a change from other takeout places I've tried, which send you home with plain soy sauce to dunk your dumplings in. My friend had teriyaki wings and fries. We spilt the Korean BBQ wings, which were pretty good, but not as mouth watering as the ones we've had at Seoul Food across town.

What I enjoyed the most was the shrimp lo mein. I noticed that it was soaked with sauce, which is what I usually deal with at other places. I never paid it much mind before, but I prefer it this way. I suppose it's just lightly tossed as opposed to saturated with grease, but the flavor did not suffer one bit. I had to leave it for the next day after stuffing myself with wings and dumplings.

The lunch special is $5.99 with a free sweet tea. Good deal. I ordered chicken and broccoli with rice. The portion size was smaller than normal Chinese food portion sizes but it was also lunch time. The food was good. The chicken was good quality, not overly sauced, and the broccoli was crisp.
The service was good as well. The cashier(maybe owner) talked with me while my order was prepared so that was nice. I will definitely be back to try some of the Korean specialities on the menu.","['galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1
664,4164,4919,zZYHZwmBl9Af4pI-aLXBFA,Choi's Korea & Wing,5,"This place is close to the house and doesn't look very good on the outside, but the inside is nice, and the food is awesome. I feel like I need to clarify why this place is called China Wing but everyone talks about the Korean food here. In Korea, Chinese restaurants are very popular and abundant but they put a Korean twist on the food they make causing it to turn into almost a fusion type cuisine such as jajangmyun which Koreans would consider chinese food but is very distinctly Korean in nature. I guess the proprietors here kept with their Korean roots and opened up a fairly Korean Chinese place. The more you know!

Anyways on to the actual review, the owners here seem very friendly. The guy on the register remembered me on the second time I came here to eat, which is impressive considering there was a pretty lengthy amount of time in between visits. I almost always order the bibimbap which is delicious and freshly made. It also comes with a nice side of kimchi, pickled daikon, and small bowl of soup. prices are reasonable, and at the end of our meal they usually throw in some stuff for free. The first time I ate here they gave us some orange slices at the end of our meal, and the second time some hot tea!

This is a nice place for some decent Korean food, they also have an American, and Chinese menu as well. They've recently added delivery service so that's awesome for the lazy times you don't want to go anywhere! Seeing as there aren't many Korean restaurants in Charlotte, this was a nice find and I'll be back whenever I have cravings for Korean food.","['galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1

667,4167,4922,YgRclUfGOFUcoslAXaZFgw,Choi's Korea & Wing,4,"China Wing... do not be deceived. This is a Korean-owned restaurant. It has a two-fold menu - one Korean, one American-Chinese. It is a little pricey than what we're used to. Think about $4-5 more than an average Korean restaurant for every dish. For example, $15 for ddukgook... DDUKGOOK. 

LOCATION
South Charlotte, off of Arrowwood. Definitely used to be a fast food restaurant at some point -- the remnants of the drive thru menu are still there. 

AMBIANCE
Dark, quiet... There were maybe 4 people in the restaurant when we went. I think more people go there for take-out rather than dining in. There are a ton of seats, with some leather booths interspersed within. 

FOOD
We had the dolsot bibimbap and the seafood soondubu. The Korean food was decent for Charlotte.. don't expect it to compare to Atlanta. It's enough to tie you over until you have time to make your way to Duluth. 

Dolsot Bibimbap
This is your typical dolsot bibimbap.. but for some reason, something felt off. Maybe it was the lettuce or the danmooji (pickled daikon) or the tomatoes that were chopped... or maybe it was that the gochujang sauce was too sweet for my taste... It definitely was enough to hold me over until I get to Atlanta but not my favorite. The beef that they added into the dish was delicious though - I have to admit. It was marinated in some sort of bulgogi (sweet teriyaki) sauce and was very very tender. 


Seafood Soondubu
Soondubu, for those who don't know, is a soft tofu soup. It's typically made with a beef broth with super mushy tofu, and topped with green onions and a raw egg that cooks in the broth. The soondubu at China Wing was okay. It doesn't taste quite like mainstream soondubu but it felt very homemade (in a good way-- like how mom would make it). You definitely have to eat it while it's hot because the tofu burned at the bottom by the end. The dish had a heavy helping of seafood mix including shrimp and squid. The broth was mild and light but very eggy (which is not quite what you would expect). Great for cold weather though.","['galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1

The menu has an extremely wide variety of items but make no mistake about it, this is a Korean restaurant first and foremost, but given the surrounding neighborhood i understand why they have other non Korean items to appeal to the varied tastes. But that in itself speaks volumes as they can make a traditional Korean dish and at the same time a Greek Gyro sandwich, both of which are top shelf. Have eaten in only, never take out and will say that the interior is nothing fancy, but it is very clean. It is family owned so they take a great deal of pride in their place and their product and the young lady behind the counter, and waiting tables, and busing them is just a doll and a sweet person. And she is as fluent with her Spanish as she is with her english and Korean. Rare to find someone like her, always happy and smiling and working hard 6 to 7 days a week.

These are the three dishes that I've had from here over the course of a few months.  I can't wait to try them all!

I wanted to give this place 5 stars, climb atop a nearby mountain and shout out how their place is awesome... but man, they give you side dishes of kimchi and radish.  Both were waaaaaaay to fermented to the point that the radish side was a little yellowed and tasted bitter from being old.  Keep the radish fresher at least!

Kinda lazy on an early Friday evening before going out, so I'm not gonna break down dishes and stuff and what I thought.  People that have had Korean food from Koreatown in LA or NY or wherever would consider their food to be legit.

It appears the place is owned by Koreans, so much props to my peeps for making good Korean food.  The dude who was there was about my age and a pretty cool dude.  Friendly.

If I had to describe China Wing I'd say it's the Sybil of restaurants.  Not that that's a bad thing.  They have wings, burgers, Philly cheese steaks, gyros, fried fish, Chinese and Korean on  their menu.  The restaurant was clean, well maintained and inviting.  The prices were reasonable compared to other places. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken along with and order fo 5 hot wings.  It was late and there was only one couple in the place.  It took a little longer to get my order than usually takes at other Chinese take out places, but it couldn't have been more than 5 minutes or so.  I got my food and headed home.  The Kung Pao wasn't quite what I've had at other places.  I haven't had much Korean food, but it tasted like a little Korean style flavoring was added in. But again that is not a bad thing, it was still very good.  The hot wings were a little on the small side I thought, but very flavorful and well cooked.  They were only $3.95 for an order of five wings.  Overall I'd recommend China Wing if you are looking to grab a bite to eat but can't decide what you want.

685,4185,4940,dl8zfSuQNW9SzTUWSIcCjw,Choi's Korea & Wing,4,"Driving up to China Wing was a little confusing.  I desperately was looking for some delicious Korean food (being 1/2 Korean) during my biz trip to Charlotte and found this little gem named, oddly enough, China Wing.

This is a family owned business that serves delicious and authentic Korean dishes as well as Chinese and some Greek food.  Unusual combination, but if you have picky eaters in your group then know there are other options to choose from.  During my frequent travels to the city, I've enjoyed eating at China Wing at least 5 times.  I've gotten to know the waitress and have brought colleagues to the restaurant to eat.  Again, I'm glad the menu had options for picky eaters.  

The dolsot bibimbap is delish.  The spicy pork is yummo.  The kimchi is right on.  My mother would probably be more critical as she is an amazing Korean cook, but I will certainly return for future meals. 

Always great, friendly, and personal service.  The prices are very affordable for Korean cuisine in Charlotte.  Don't let the building fool you.  Try it then decide for yourself.

687,4187,4942,qjYXOBnladFYhciGBSgAMw,Choi's Korea & Wing,1,"I wouldn't have even considered stopping into China Wing if not for being brought in here by my good friend. It's like a hidden gem hole in the wall in Charlotte. It's truly unassuming and even the name is a bit un-fitting. It brings to mind those China Ones and China Kings and other generically named Chinese take-outs that are a staple in every Food Lion shopping center across the south east. China Wing, despite the name, is almost anything but.

Inside you'll find they've set up shop inside what used to be a fast food restaurant. Surprising to me, the daughter of the owners informed us they've been here for 20 years. This daughter of the owners actually took our orders and served us our food. Her and her parents are actually Korean, not Chinese. To be fair, one of the neon signs outside does say they do Korean food too. If you ask me I'd say they should change the name to Korea Wing simply because they seem to do that best. I also find it more unique.

I ordered a bowl of bibimbap. Easily my favorite Korean dish I haven't had it in years. It was just as good as I remember. An assortment of veggies, beef, rice and an over-easy egg in a searing hot bowl. When you get it you let it sizzle a bit to crisp the rice in the bottom. Then you stir it up and have at it. If you fear the spiciness of Korean food this is one sure-fire way to avoid it. Their menu is basically divided with Chinese food on one side and Korean on the opposite. An interesting fusion item I'd like to try here some day is the bulgogi cheesesteak. The cheesebulgogi in a word.

The prices were a bit high in my opinion. About $12-13 for the bibimbap. Although this isn't usually a cheap-o dish. Maybe they have better lunch-time deals too. I intend to go back again regardless!","['galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1

So...I met a Korean friend here yesterday to indulge in some highly craved items. For me, it was Jjajangmyun and Kimchi Pancake. Both were SO Good!!! My friend had BiBimBop and Tteokbokki...and not too sure what she thought of hers. I DID try her Tteokbokki...and though good, they tasted somewhat Americanized...much sweeter. 

Again, I will recommend trying their Jjajangmyun, the Black Bean Noodles...It's a Must-Try! I actually liked their Kimchi Pancake better than their Seafood Pancake (tried in the past). 

Though we hit the place for a late lunch, the place was fairly busy. Still, the service was great, as usual. However, I noticed that their overhead, playing K-Pop ballads, weren't on yesterday. :( Still, this place is a keeper!","['galbigui', 'bibimbap']",1

It was so delicious that when we went back a few weeks later, I got it again.

My husband is more a BBQ fan, so he got the bulgogi first time around and second time around, he got the spicy pork. Both were terrific, as were the array of veggie side dishes that come with the meal. 

But the main draw for us, on top of the reasonably priced and delicious food, is the decency of the staff there.

Well, all I can say is YUM!!! Their Jjajangmyeon was Amazing...with a generous mix of minced pork and veggies, and a ton of thick, juicy noodles! Can't even tell you how much I love this DEE-lish dish. It's actually such a popular K dish, there's this quirky movie (Castaway on the Moon, 2009) about it in Korea lol!

Anyway, Jjajangmyeon aside, I also had another one of my faves, the Tangsuyuk, a sweet and tangy fried pork dish...and again, YUM!! The version here is super crunchy too. 

All I can say is, if you haven't yet tried Jjajangmyeon and Tangsuyuk, you're missing out. Highly recommended!!!

They serve among the best authentic Korean in the Southeast. The food is great with a long list varieties of Korean dishes.

Honestly, the best thing was the vegetable rice. The wings were those little tiny drumettes And they were dry and tough to chew. I ordered them honey barbecue style and they just literally poured a little bit of honey barbecue sauce on them. It wasn't soaked in the sauce so therefore it didn't permeate through to the meat. The fried shrimp honestly look like they came out of the frozen box of shrimp you get at the grocery store. The vegetable rice was good and flavorful.

I dined in. There was only one man working the front of house, but he was very friendly. The menu has a lot. There's common Chinese dishes and a whole side of the menu dedicated to Korean dishes. This is what I came for. I ordered the fried dumplings and the beef bulgogi. The dumplings were crisp and light and okay. There's other apps I want to try more. The bulgogi was so flavorful and delicious. First off it comes out on a sizzling plate and you get all the sides with it. I wasn't sure what everything was, but the only piece I could have done without was the bean sprouts. I even liked the Kimchi, which I'm discovering I do like when it's fresh. Back to the bulgogi, the meat was tender and I liked it was cooked with thinly sliced vegetables. Sometimes the sauce on bulgogi can lean on the sweet side, but this one had a nice balance of savory and sweet. I couldn't eat everything and was happy to have leftovers.

The bulgogi was tender but not the super thin cuts of meat I was anticipating. It was more chunky but still tasty. The jap chae noodles were on the very soft side. I am very familiar with sweet potato noodles and I just felt that they were not cooked fresh, had been sitting for a while and warmed up with fresh veggies on my order. I could be wrong and maybe they just over boiled them but I wasn't impressed.

I've had generally good luck here as long as it's on weekends- the place gets really, really busy at weekday lunches and it's basically a two-person operation as far as I can tell. You order at the counter and the nice PBTC brings you your food. Prices are more than fair and portions very generous. I got a spin on dolsot bibimbap today (it's a Saturday) that was made with deep-fried pork. This is, apparently, a new menu item.

The dolsot is INSANELY HOT and you have to wait a long time until it's cooled off enough to eat and to let that gorgeous crust form on the searing hot dolsot, but oh my God this was delicious and not something I've ever seen on any Korean menu, never mind having tasted anything like it before. I squirted on gochujang and some mayo that's brought out in these massive squeeze bottles, not just a tiny ramekin of either, and once it was edibly cooled off- I loved it. LOVED it. The only thing I'd ask for is more banchan but as I couldn't even finish the dish per se, I wouldn't call that a complaint.","['japchae', 'tteokbokki', 'bibimbap', 'sundubujjigae', 'bulgogi', 'jeyukbokkeum']",1

The prices are way higher now, ($10-20 per meal) which is not too bad if the food quality is good as well. I'm up for a bargain, but I tend to like food that is more worth the price. 

We ordered an orginal bibimbap, chicken bibimbap, and tonkatsu. The bibimbap dishes were good, but it wasn't worth it. The bibimbap dishes also came with miso soup, which was very plain and 2 side dishes. Again, it's nothing special and there weren't enough side dishes that came with them. The tonkatsu was very disappointing. They gave you rice, cabbage salad(some of the cabbage was turning black) and heated up frozen veggies that you could buy in any grocery store.

Okay, I wouldn't have complained a long time ago, because the prices were so cheap and the food was decent. But now I was suprised at how the quality of the dishes deteriorated! 

And trust me I have frequented this establishment since 2011 until 2014. So I guess for the 3 years I didn't visit them, all these changes happened. The only thing that didn't change was that they still only take cash, which is a total inconvenience.

I give them 2 stars for their good service, okay food, and for the free tea and water. Makes me sad that I will not be returning to Kim Chi House again probably for longer than 3 years.","['japchae', 'tteokbokki', 'bibimbap', 'sundubujjigae', 'bulgogi', 'jeyukbokkeum']",0

The cashier saw me staring at the menu for awhile she explained to me that spicy chicken wasn't really that spicy.

I've come back three times since my initial visit and they seem to recognize a familiar face. Especially because they're not that busy and they have a lot of competition within the food court. The most expensive thing on the menu was $15 for beef short ribs. The food comes served in a nice plastic tupperware with different sections.

The menu is a bit limited, but covers a lot of the basics. I was dining by myself, so I didn't get to try the Kimchijeon, which was still enticing. It has a couple vegetarian main options (japchae and bibimbap), and they were happy to add tofu for $1. The bibimbap was pretty tasty, though I was disappointed that it wasn't served in a hot stone bowl - which is something I really love. So, I didn't get to cook the egg yolk with the rice, stir it all around with a spoon (uh, there were no spoons at the table?) and eat it with a spoon (which, my understanding, is the traditional utensil for this dish). 

Sadly, unlike most Korean restaurants I've been to, the main didn't come accompanied with a selection of tiny banchan side dish appetizers which I usually really love.

I had decided it was a non-drinking day already, so I didn't get try any of their interesting Soju cocktails or very enticing craft beers on draft!

Traditional Korean - this place is not. It definitely has the Brooklyn hipster industrial bar-restaurant metal+wood+edison bulb atmosphere going on. It was pretty quiet when I was there. I don't think I saw a single Korean person working there - though I didn't go to the kitchen.

Overall, the food I did order tasted good. It's a bit expensive for what you get, though, and not as good as, say, Nak Won Garden. But, hey, they have a full bar and are nicely located on Penn Ave.","['kimchijeon', 'gimbap']",1

The chef came to the table and didn't even introduce himself.  It was odd and uncomfortable.  

This is a typical Pittsburgh restaurant; wrong music, waitstaff wearing sports shirts and the food is below average.

Friend 1 really enjoyed her Soju, Asian Pear, Lemon, Ginger, Soda cocktail, calling it refreshing, perfect for a summer's day.  I had the Bulleit Bourbon, Bulleit Rye, Plum, Honey, Basil cocktail, served up in a coupe glass, very tasty!  Other 2 friends enjoyed some beers. Pork Mandu app was very tasty! But somehow our dinner order got lost, so there was a delay, but the waitress made up for it with a round of drinks on the house, very nice. 3 of us got the Korean BBQ Combo, a mix of Kalbi, Bulgogi, and Dwaejibulgogi. I was tempted by the Octopus Poke, but the smell of the grilled meat platter from our neighbors was too intoxicating not to try! I'm not a big kimchi fan, but their version is not too bad, and along with the pickled cucumbers come with the dish (banchan) as traditional, so I did eat it and wonderfully complimented the meat and rice.  Friend 2 got the Tuna Poke and declared it delish. The chef came out & said hello to check on us, & we all agreed the dinners were a success. He said the Octopus Poke is not a big seller so they may discontinue it, so i'll have to get back soon to try it.  Other than the delay/snafu, the only drawbacks were the room was kind of cold ( it was a cool evening but the air was on full blast ) , and the music was kind of loud. The waitress even asked us to repeat our drink & food selections as it was so loud. And loud from the crowd chatter too, as it was busy, so maybe turn the music down & add some sound dampening devices, (or even some art?!) on the walls... But all in all a welcome addition to our neighborhood, we'll be back !","['kimchijeon', 'gimbap']",

I've been wanting to try different things on their menu, but I always end up getting the katsu curry because it's just soooo good. They offer huge mugs (liters) of beer and their green grape, grapefruit, and plum soju are all delicious.
I've been here 3 times and 2 out of 3 times the waitress has given us free drinks just so we could try the soju (without even asking). My husband and I went recently and it was pretty empty so the waitress invited us to the bar to do shots of plum wine with her, the chef, and the rest of the staff.

We got the Nori fries,  because I've an unhealthy obsession with fries, and enjoyed the take on it with the nori. My companion ordered the kalbi and i got the Korean bbq combination. My goodness was it all good! The mixture of flavors and seasonings was well balanced. My companion got the soju plum which he liked.

Despite the fact that the restaurant is listed as a restaurant, a label as bar may suit it better, because the menu is extremely limited. Besides, the food cannot even be called Korean fusion. It is purely a deviation of Korean based on misunderstanding. 

I ordered the kimchi fried rice and BBQ chicken. The fried rice is way too sour, as many other reviewers have stated, and you know that the kimchi is the problem. BBQ chicken is average, or let's put it this way, you can grill it yourself without any efforts. 

I didn't try any drinks, as many reviewers have said that they were too sweet. Good taste? Maybe, who hates sweetness? However, I don't plan to get diabetes. 

The restaurant is worth 3 stars, as you can tell that it tries hard based on its hipster decor and the Asian Fusion style. I will give it 2 stars to warn you that it is overrated.","['kimchijeon', 'gimbap']",

Started with the pork and kimchi dumplings.  Delicious. Not too greasy and cooked to perfection.  Loved the spicy dipping sauce.  

Ordered the bbq chicken entree and was very happy with my meal.  Chicken was NOT dry, flavorful and charred perfectly. I was really impressed with the tasty side of vegetables.  This place actually got me to eat all of my string beans and beets!  The sauce for this entree was money.  I told the chef he needs to bottle it up and sell it because it's that's good.  

Loved the atmosphere of this place.  Warm and inviting. I sat at the bar and had a great experience. After having to choose from many delicious beers and cocktails, I ordered a really well crafted sangria.

When you come in, you can seat yourself and do not waste time waiting for a host. When we came in around 7pm, they weren't busy so they told us we can sit wherever we want. But during our time at the restaurant, it got filled pretty quick and people were coming in, we saw them waiting to be seated for a long time before the waitress get a chance to stopover and tell them seat themselves at the bar or any table. 
We were really happy with the food but not the service. Our appetizer came out very fast but it took a very long time for the entry. 
Ordered Chicken kasu, it is fried chicken with house bbq sauce. 10/10 crispy batter and well seasoned chicken. Madu, we got the pork ones. I would say they are 7.5/10. It is essentially fried dumplings. The dipping sauce is sour and spicy/sweet, but the filling were a little bit dry. For entry, we got BBQ combo, 8.5/10, it came with 3 kinds of bbq, kabi ribs, bogogi and grilled pork. I like the beef better than the pork. The pork turned out a little dry but the beef were very juicy, tender and flavorful. Also the BBQ combo comes with two small side plates, it includes kimchi, radish and pickled cucumber. 

As I was saying the slow service, we waited long time to get it, even people came in after us ordered the same thing and had their entry for a while and we were still waiting. After we finished our meal, we waited long time for the check, even we try get eye contact so that our waitress would notice that we are ready for a check. Not very effective. Eventually, we were able to get her attention by waving.

Although the Katsu tastes like a regular yellow curry dish, which still begs the question, what distinguishes Korean food from other Asian foods?

Everything was great! The Gimbap were good but not amazing like the other three. We will definitely be back! The bartender was really nice too!

We went in around 7:30 on a Tuesday. As soon as we walked in a table opened up so we didn't have to wait which was nice. There are maybe only 10 tables and a small bar area in the restaurant so I could see it getting really busy on the weekends so plan accordingly. 

We ordered the Mandu to start, then Chicken Katsu and Kimchi Fried Rice with beef for entrees. We shared everything and it was more than enough food. The mandu was ok. (I'm still comparing to the ones I had in Boston. I dream about these things man. Maybe I loved them so much because I was hungover haha). My husband liked them very much though. The chicken katsu was fine. Nothing super special to me. What earned this place 5 stars was the kimchi fried rice! Oh man! Amazing! I couldn't stop saying how good it was.

I chose the poke and asked them to do half of each style.  The shoyu style was far superior for my tastes, but I appreciated that I was able to try both.  It was a healthy portion and I was barely able to finish it after the appetizers.  My boyfriend got the Bibimbap, which was also a winner.  Again, the dish was sizable and the beef was dressed really nicely.   

At the end of the meal, the bartender offered up a shot of soju, which was a nice touch.

Soju has a casual atmosphere where grandma and the hipster with a food notebook can easily dine together at a communal table. I've never been to Korea so I can't speak to how authentic it is - but I can certainly confirm it's tasty (and so can Grandma).

We couldn't decide between the three grill options so went with the mix. The pork, beef tenderloin, and short rib over rice were all delicious. Next time (and there will be a next time), it's beef tenderloin all the way. The savory pancake was.. savory. The Korean sushi was.. Korean? It had marinated beef and a collection of vegetables that all blended very nicely. The kimchi fried rice was good and had some good crunch to it. Of all the dishes, this one I could take or leave.

Overall, good time and great meal.

Their fried tofu.... way too hot to eat at first (this is a good thing, trust me). For taste and authenticity, it was a great as was the Tteokbokki. Regarding portion sizes, Soju offers decently large dishes at very fair prices. While their hours indicate that they are a brunch or dinner joint, they do have happy hour deals as well.

Hubs and several others at the table got Soju, Maggie's Farm White Rum, Mango, Pineapple, Pomegranate, Ginger, Yakuroto Yogurt, Chillsung Soda. It was good, but very sweet.

The group ordered the pancake to start. It was good, but lacked some of the crispiness and flavor that I was hoping for. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good for where we are. 

Hubs ordered the combo plate. The pork and beef were quite tasty, the chicken was so so.... I had the bibimbap without meat since hubs had so much meat (we had enough for leftovers). It worked and balanced well in terms of food. The egg in the bibimbap was over hard, which is my main complaint. Delicious nonetheless. 

I capped out the evening with the Soju, Asian Pear, Lemon, Ginger, Soda. It was refreshing for the warm evening, but sweet. Seems like the thing here.

Good addition to the area and reasonably priced. I can see myself coming back.","['kimchijeon', 'gimbap']",

843,4343,5098,3bo1FXvQnxw2hmO0CHH4Nw,Soju,4,"I was excited to try this place as there are few Koreans options in Pittsburgh and I love Korean food.  I was expecting it to be a bit more Americanized from what I had read; however, I was still disappointed.  The interior looks like a typical hipster sort of place with a nice looking bar and communal seating. There are a variety of sojus on the drink menu which was nice.  However, while the food seemed to be generally prepared well and used high quality ingredients, everything I ordered was cloyingly sweet, which really detracted from the experience.  This included the katsu dipping sauce, the kimbap sushi (because of the bulgogi marinade), and the mixed BBQ entree. It reminded me of Chinese restaurants that are overly Americanized where all the sauces are sickeningly sweet. I'll still give it 3 stars as there were some people who like that sort of Americanized asian cuisine with the sweet sauces, but it is not authentic tasting and did not suit my particular tastes well. The pervasiveness of the sweet marinades and sauces ended up making everything taste the same, which was too bad as I could tell the meat was tender, cooked perfectly, and of a nice quality, so I would have liked to taste the actual meat better.  Another major disappointment was the banchan, which for me is the highlight of going to a Korean restaurant, and the range and quality of the banchan is a sign for me of how good a Korean restaurant is. However, only select dishes came with banchan, which only included 2 banchan items (pickled cucumbers and pickled radish), and everyone on the table gets duplicates of the same banchan. I wouldn't really classify this as a Korean restaurant, but more of an asian-fusion restaurant as everything is so Americanized, and there are other asian dishes on the menu that aren't Korean, such as Japanese (katsu) and Hawaiian (poke). This place also appears to be run entirely by Caucasians as there wasn't an actual Asian person in sight, although I couldn't see the kitchen area. The clientele was also 90% Caucasian, which is telling, as all the best Asian restaurants in town have a much higher percentage of Asian diners who know where to find the real high quality authentic places. The prices are also quite high for the amount of food you get, although the service was prompt and attentive.","['kimchijeon', 'gimbap']",

They had a lot of good looking cocktails but I'll save that for next time. 

I had the dumplings- half and half. Tasty!! I thought I'd like the pork more, but I think I liked the tofu. Both really good though. 

Next I had the katsu chicken Curry. Totally hit the spot especially on a cold night like this (will be 9 degrees tonight!). I didn't finish it all but it was an internal struggle inside not to try.

Soju puts a twist to tradition Korean food dining with the design of the restaurant and the presentation of the food. The restaurant looks very much like a cafe with the art, the hanging lights, and the wooden tables; quite aesthetic. The food menu was very limited in comparison to a standard Korean restaurant. However, the drinks menu was more extensive. It was very nice of the owner/head-chef to greet us and thank us for coming out. Overall service was great and presentation was nice~

Soju Punch: 
A mix between soju, yakuroto yogurt, and tropical fruits. This tasted really good! Taste like an alcoholic version of Yakult/Calpico.

Korean BBQ Combination:
If you're like me and loves to try everything, get this! You get all the three meats they offer: Kalbi, bulging, and dwaejibulgogi. It comes with white rice and two banchans, kimchi and pickled cucumbers. You get three decently sized pieces of each meat: The meats were cooked and seasoned well. The sauces were on the sweet side. I liked it, but for $18, I expected a bit more stuff. The banchan included pickled cucumbers and kimchi. The pickled cucumbers was sooo good, just the right amount of sourness and sweetness. The kimchi however, was more sour than spicy.

Kimchi fried rice with egg:
The egg was perfectly cooked over easy. The fried rice was seasoned well, but it was not that spicy. The kimchi was more sour than spicy. As someone who loves sour food, I still thought it was sour. Maybe it would've been more enjoyable if it was a bit more spicy and a bit less sour. 

VERDICT:

Would I order them again? I would order the drink and the meat again, but not the fried rice.

Would I go back again? If you want me to. I'd go if my friends want to go. But I would not be the one suggesting it.","['kimchijeon', 'gimbap']",

The food has been consistently good, if not entirely traditional. I still *really* wish that the bibimbap was served in a hot stone (dolsot), but alas, it isn't.

But hey, they have spoons at the tables now, their staff is very friendly, and I've met the chef now a couple times. He offered to make the katsu curry with tofu instead of chicken - and it was *excellent*. I suggested that he make that a permanent menu option.

I've also been able to try several of their drinks. Great beer selection, and the cocktails have also been pretty great.","['kimchijeon', 'gimbap']",

It's a beautiful little spot in Bloomfield that was fairly busy (though it was a Friday night). We were seated pretty quickly though and seemed to beat an influx of people right after us.

It's a single-page menu, but it features enough choices that picking what I wanted was difficult. The menu also had the added bonus of featuring pronunciations for all the dishes I've been mispronouncing for oh so many years. There's also an extensive alcohol list with unique cocktails and a handful of choices of Soju, the drink that serves as the restaurant's namesake (I recommend it).

The service was great and made for a wonderful experience overall. I chose the Korean BBQ combination and it seemed to be the perfect portion when combined with half an appetizer (the tteokbokki is something I highly recommend).

We had a large party, so we basically got to try a little of everything.  The Gimbap was tasty, with sweet rice and marinated beef balancing the crunchy daikon and subtle flavor of the Nori.  The Kimchijeon was smooth with just the right proportions of ingredients (meaning, no huge chunks of seafood popping out of the filling).  But the best appetizer was the Tteokbokki - the tenderest rice cakes dipped in a sweet-spice sauce, I had no shame in finishing off that plate and asking for another.  The Galbi and Bulgogi were seasoned just right and disappeared quickly, and the Salmon and ChickenKatsu were both cooked perfectly, with a nice addition of grilled beets and zucchini to balance the flavors.  And remember to save some room for their cheesecake -- not exactly traditional Korean fare, but when you taste it, you won't care.  I'm definitely going back.

Fair warning, there will be a line when you show up - we arrived exactly at 5pm when they opened, and we were seated quickly, but by the time we were done, there was a line out the door, in the rain.  But be patient -- this food is definitely worth waiting for.","['kimchijeon', 'gimbap']",

To start, we ordered four appetizers- the tteokboki (spicy stir fried rice cakes), the killer tofu, the gimbap, and the kimchi pancake. The stir fried rice cakes were personally my favorite, because I loved the texture of the rice cakes and the sauce they were in. It was spicy, thick, and bursting with flavor. My second favorite was a tie between the tofu or the pancake. The tofu was crispy but soft, and the sauce again was excellent. The pancake is yummy and a great way to soak up that extra delicious sauce. The gimbap was good too. 

For my main course, I had the bimbimbap with beef. The bimbimbap was outstanding and the beef had a sweet flavor and was cooked perfectly- it wasn't tough or dry. I loved how they put lots of veggies in the bimbimbap that went together with the sauce. I loved the pickles in the bowl! The rice was also soft and sticky...mmm. If you go to Soju, just remember that you can't go wrong with the bimbimbap! In addition to my love for Soju's bimbimbap, my dad raved about his chicken katsu- he said that he could just order a giant plate of it and just eat that and be happy.

The food was amazing... big portions with lots of flavors. One of us was vegetarian so we got all vegetarian appetizers and they have tons of options. 


Kimchijeon was a sweet yet savory pancake that was huge and delicious.

Younger crowd and kind of wonky decor (pictures of large partially naked people, lots of exposed brick) all add to that feel. Service was casual and friendly.

Food is very solid. My girlfriend and I split two appetizers. The kimchi pancake was pretty standard for Korean places, but very crispy (vs. soft). It came with a very zesty dipping sauce. The Korean poutine was basically a large bowl of thick fries in a curry gravy. There were some tofu pieces that were supposed to substitute for cheese curds but didn't add much. Not sure what was Korean about this but it was tasty. We also got the bibimbap bowl which was our favorite! Plentiful mix of veggies, rice, and bulgogi beef with the spicy red sauce.

The first impressions of this store were promising - the decor was contemporary and waitresses friendly. However, we were given A4 paper menus with a limited selection of choices. I ordered the bibimbap for 18 dollars (it was 14 dollars + 4 dollars for beef which I thought was absurd and reflects a poor pricing strategy). The food itself was pretty good, I would argue a little too sweet but given the target audience it makes sense, but absolutely not worth the price of nearly 20 dollars. The bibimbap also comes with no side dishes, a necessary practice in Korean cuisine.

The Kimchijeon (kimchi pancake) was perfectly fried, crisp, and delicious and, again, the sauce that came with it was the perfect accompaniment. For the main course, we split the Korean BBQ sample, mostly because my indecisive self can never pick just one thing. All three - the kalbi, bulgogi, and dwaejibulgogi - were phenomenal. Tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. I would recommend any of them individually, but the combo is a great chance to try all three.

What a great place to land itself in the constantly developing and trendy Pittsburgh food scene. Highly recommended.","['kimchijeon', 'gimbap']",

After a few drinks and kimchi pancake we decided to just stay at the bar. Conversation with the waitstaff was awesome and insightful. They also let us know that they all share responsibility and gratuity so just made sense.

For a  dinner drink, I ordered the spam jam per a rec from the staff and it did not disappoint. Smokey and light. Perfect!

It was full, and we snagged the last two bar seats before others came in and had to wait 20-30 mins for a table/bar seats. The place was very brightly lit providing a welcoming ambience. We started with the scallop pancake and the rice cakes. The pancake was a little dark for our liking,  but it tasted good. The rice cakes were disappointing. They were just pieces of starch in some spicy sweet sauce, but after the first one or two pieces, it got very boring. There needed to be something else to provide a textural contrast. We didn't finish this dish. For mains, we had the mixed grilled meats and the kimchi fried rice. The mixed grill came with a side of ban chan. The meat was very soft and well seasoned, while the kimchi fried rice was tasty, but a little too oily. Service was ok throughout, but servers did seem a little cold at times. They had some really cool cocktails that might be worth a try. Overall, decent experience, but we probably won't be running back to eat there again.

Possibly the pedestrian street next to the restaurant is taking away from their business... anyhow regardless, I was here to eat and I was hungry! The restaurant itself has a bit of modern feel to it and tastefully decorated. Above all it seemed to be very clean and organized including the kitchen, which we could see right into at the back of the space.

Asides from other meal choices, this resto offers the option to build your own bibimbap by choosing the type of rice, protein, vegetables and sauce (spicy please!)... but since my focus was the bibimbap that will be all I will cover in this review.

Since this was my first time at this Korean resto I went for a classic version of the beef bibimbap, to allow me to compare to my previous experiences in other restaurants. Holy cow! This was heaven on a plate or should I say bowl. Everything was so fresh and tasty, the beef was perfectly seasoned, the kimchee had an amazing flavour profile. All in all, I was totally blown away as this instantly became my fave Korean in town! The lunch deal cost around 10 bucks for a soup, the bibimbap and kimchee, nice ! Good value and good times. Service was also very quick and friendly so I'll be back for sure.... probably soon as I am already lusting for another bowl of goodness.","['galbigui', 'bulgogi', 'bibimbap']",

Korean fried chicken and bibimbap, what's not to like? The interior has a modern, almost sterile look to it. Not necessarily my flavor, but no complaints. The young man serving us seemed somewhat new at the food service game, but I've been there before so I gave him a pass. We ordered the sweet and spicy fried chicken and the bibimbap. The chicken was solid, had a bit of a cinnamon twang to it, but could've used a little more kick. We used the hot sauce that came with the bibimbap to dip the chicken in, and that made all the difference. Speaking of the bibimbap, it was also pretty solid, maybe could spen more time getting crispy in the clay pot, but otherwise pretty good. Overall i give this place a solid 3 stars, but unfortunately for these folks it'll be hard competing with their neighbors at Mon Ami.","['friedchicken', 'yangnyeomchicken']",

However, the food is absolutely excellent with some innovative offerings I have not seen elsewhere.

Olive oil fried chicken sort of has a healthy ring to it doesn't it.... This review is mainly for the original fried chicken. i have read that a lot of the other friend chicken with sauce are quite soggy and not very good. Personally the original fried chicken is quite crispy and has a clean flavor to it based on the oil used for frying. This leans to a crisp fried chicken instead of the chunky hard fried chicken you get at other fried fast food restaurants. The only issue is that the fried chicken comes at a cost. it is unbelievably expensive and the chicken pieces are also quite small. With that, it is good for a 1 time experience, but I will take my fried chicken cravings elsewhere. 

Pros: olive oil to fry chicken, waffle fries

Cons: Very expensive, takes a while to prepare the chicken sometimes

The menu has  a variety of fried items and rice bowls (priced at 6.95) and some random soup items (one priced at 16.99...crazy).

I got the spicy pork rice bowl.  Maybe 30 or so minutes later our food came. It was deliciously flavored and a good amount of rice. I think some of the pork pieces had too much excess fat on it and there could have been a side of some vegetables. There were some onions in it. I liked it but I don't see me craving to go here.

This place is pretty pricey for the food that you get, but I will say that their original olive chicken was a good starter to go with. However, I think their sweet and spicy chicken was a bit over spiced. I normally am okay with medium spicy foods, but this was way too spicy for me. 

I got my food relatively quickly, although the service seemed chaotic in the back. I also got the wrong order, which I didn't notice until later (I got take-out). I wish they had more options (especially with their garlic trio option - I would've liked to have been able to try one or two of those flavors without having to order all three), but this place seems decent. Their menu screen kept flickering, which was slightly annoying when I was trying to read the menu. I'd honestly probably wait a couple of weeks to a month before coming here again, and hopefully by then they've added more options / finished polishing their recipes.

 The honey garlic wings taste nah-ah Korean sauce, not even close to it. The chickens were not hot, it was just warm temperature because they let out the food that is already cooked whatever hours before.

 I agree when  KFC does this cause it is fast-food store with cheaper price. However BBQ costs way more than KFC but still providing chickens already cooked? I never saw any other BBQs in United State do that. All other retail BBQs are made to order, tastes the same (I went the other BBQs in VA, NY).

The place is really nicely decorated and the tables are comfy and roomy. It reminds me a lot of Asian KFC, which makes a lot of sense. The chairs are comfy and while there's a lot of places to sit, it's not too cluttered to navigate easily. I really like their wall art! It is loud so it might be kind of hard to hear at times. 

Menu: 3/5

Their menu is limited right now so double check your orders cause they might not have it in stock yet. There are some definite hits and misses. For example the Cheeseling is terrible but the Sweet Spicy and Original are great. Beware of things that don't look like the pictures provided. 

Quality: 4/5

Im taking an extra point off for how old and cold the Cheeseling my friend ordered was but the rest seemed pretty good in terms of quality. You can even see the steam when you break open a piece of chicken! The side dishes aren't worth it in my opinion, except for maybe the biscuit. Rice is mushy and Cole slaw is watery. 

Service: 2/5

Beware it is very,  very slow right now but hopefully once the employees get into the swing of things stuff picks up. I didn't take off any stars for the wait, which was hopefully a temporary thing.

The rice to chicken ratio is off - way too much white rice left over with pretty much zero flavor. The chicken was crispy, but again, the flavor wasn't amazing. 

I'm just a white girl that doesn't know much about authentic Korean cuisine, but I've had MUCH BETTER on campus. Namely, Spoon House and Jip Bap. I would definitely recommend Jip Bap 100 times before recommending this place for a much more flavorful version of a similar dish. 

Wait wasn't too long, but the restaurant was nearly empty. Decor is nice.","['yangnyeomchicken', 'friedchicken']",
928,4428,5183,OsxFlOrv9dhk_v19mPgIoA,BBQ Premium Chicken,5,"I was craving Korean Fried Chicken and called a pickup order for a full chicken to share with my friends. We ordered olive fried and sweet spicy and picked it up in 10 minutes. We happily went home to eat it, but after one bite of the sweet spicy, our mouths were on fire and it turned out they gave us the wrong flavour. Also, the fried chicken was also just tossed with the sauce and therefore spicy flavour was only 1/2 covered with sauce. 

Anyhow, we went to go return switch it back. NBD everyone makes mistakes and they apologized but we had some trouble communicating what went wrong because they seemed really frazzled and busy even though the store was almost empty. 

The chicken was alright, not great but I think it wasn't worth the money or the hassle.

I ordered the chicken bowl with soy garlic sauce, which I thought would not be spicy, but it was a tad spicy, which worked well with the mayo they added on the top.
The reason why I can't rave any more about this place is the service. I haven't felt this uncomfortable in a long time. I came in and the guy who took my order, looked at me once, and looked disgusted. Then, he murmured a few questions, which was hard to hear, and since I responded incorrectly, he asked me again with an unfriendly tone. I don't understand why he treated me this way, but I was extremely uncomfortable and irritated. I don't know him and he doesn't know me. I didn't do anything to him nor did I even say anything to him. Maybe he was having a bad day, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be coming here again after that experience.

The old location was so fun - cheap but delicious food and drinks and you can sing to your heart's content in a private room with your friends!

This new location is all that but so much more. The space is large but still intimate and the karaoke rooms are beautiful.  The drinks are just as good as I remembered them years ago and the food is just next level - a vast improvement on the food previously served.  I would say that the food is Korean/Korean fusion.  Even at 11pm, the food was amazing. When I realized that they were open for lunch, I had to try it.  They have an off-the-menu seafood udon soup that hubby discovered and it was so fragrant and had all the unami flavours - only thing was, the portion size was WAY too big for the three of us!  We also had the bulgogi gyoza (a must order!) and the KFC (scrumptious!).  One of my friends ordered the bibimbap but I was too full from the udon noodle soup to try it.

Despite how delicious the food was, the restaurant was not busy for lunch.  I'd attribute it to the new location and the fact that people wouldn't generally assume it would be serving lunch.

I will definitely be back for lunch as often as I can!  And, of course, when I had the urge to sing pop songs with my friends. This place is a hidden gem.","['friedchicken', 'baechukimchi', 'bibimbap', 'japchae']",

I spent a summer with my friends in Korea going to a number of Karaokes and in all fairness they weren't always clean or nice. That and $20 for one hour of Karaoke is a great rate. The service is actually pretty decent as well. But there's a vibe to the place that makes this place feel ghetto and trashy. The lack of a front door (and entrance by alley) starts things off on a bad note, and the interior is poorly put together. The rooms themselves felt a little small (although the Karaoke machines were the top of the line). 

The food of course was way overpriced and I would HIGHLY recommend against trying anything on the menu, unless it's an appetizer meant to be eaten as you drink. Not only is the quality of the food questionable, it is a poor representation of Korean food. 

At the end of the night, you will have fun with your friends. And even cost wise if you go with a large group and share food and drinks, the bill will be pretty reasonable.

I drove around that day to locate the spot and the sketchy feeling followed me as it was in the back-alley. Later that night we entered that same alley entrance and every step made me want to reconsider taking another step forward. But since we had friends waiting, we decided to make a night of it.

Sketchy. Everything was in Korean. Even the karoke machines. Drinks were good. We had a private room to ourselves and were left alone. Great location to set-up some major drug deals if you are into the drug-dealing bidness. When we left the end of the night, a little drunk and karokied out, the atmosphere was just as sketchy.

951,4451,5216,NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Mon Ami - Somerled,5,"The quest for a good Korean restaurant in Montr챕al has officially come to an end, my friends. THIS is the place to go for some good, solid, home-cooked Korean food, and if the fact that I basically downed all of it in one sitting isn't a clear indication, then brace yourselves.

Upon walking in, I was greeted with a wait time of approximately 10-15 minutes, which totally was okay with me despite having travelled by metro and bus to get there. Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do to get good food, right? Anyway, it seemed popping with a mostly Asian crowd gorging on KFC (Korean Fried Chicken, that is) and other Korean specialities like soft tofu stew and bibimbap, which is always a good sign. After being seated, I decided to go with the half order of fried chicken, a plate of fried mandu (dumplings), and a kimchi jjigae (pork, kimchi, and tofu stew served with rice). It may seem like a lot, but it was all worth it in the end.

Besides the fact that they actually give you a decent selection of banchan (things like pickled radish cubes, side salad with thousand island dressing, kimchi and other pickled vegetables), everything clearly seemed to be freshly made in house and comes out piping hot. The kimchi jjigae was served with its contents boiling in the pot, just like it should, and it was perfectly spicy and contained just the right amount of each ingredient. The rice soaked up the broth and made it so much more dimensional that it would have been if eaten plain. The mandu were crisp and contained a nice meat filling, and even though I've had better, it came with 12 of them so I didn't really care because they still tasted good! Finally, the star of the meal came out, and it was - you guessed it - the FRIED CHICKEN. OMG. I think I died and went to heaven upon biting into the super-crispy, twice-fried outer layer and sunk my teeth into juicy meat heaven. It helped a lot too that KFC is mostly served with dark meat instead of white because everyone who knows chicken is aware of the fact that THAT'S where all the flavor is. The batter was also well-seasoned and served as a perfect soggy-proof coating for the chicken. Basically, all of these criteria are what make Korean Fried Chicken the absolute gold standard, especially when compared to its often-soggy, underseasoned American counterpart. 

At the end of the meal, I was almost completely stuffed but over the moon at the same time. Even though I have to travel 4.5 miles (sorry for the Americanisms, haha) by public transportation to get here, Mon Ami deserves nothing less than a 5-star rating, and I would 100% come back at the next opportunity.","['friedchicken', 'sundubujjigae']",

I never associated Korean restaurants and fried chicken, but theirs is amazing- I haven't had such good chicken in years. The meat is high quality, the fry is crisp and not greasy, and the portions are generous. I also had a pork and kim chee stew- it also included mushrooms, tofu, and some vegetables. It was nice and spicy and loaded with ingredients. Definitely a favorite now. I haven't tried the lunch specials but they look good and super cheap. The counter staff have been friendly and helpful (they talked me out of ordering ramen as takeout because they felt the noodles wouldn't hold up). The menu has some more exotic offerings as well- looking forward to trying more. This area of Somerled hasn't had a Korean restaurant - so this is a perfect addition to the neighborhood.","['friedchicken', 'sundubujjigae']",

Alright,the actual two words I wanted to use were: FRIED CHICKEN! Followed closely by BYOW,enough said people.

My girl Cat D. suggested it & she hasn't steered me wrong yet,so off I went. I've just moved back from the southern USA & if I learned anything there,it's how to tell lip smacking well seasoned fried chicken from the KFC/PFK stuff.

It's clean,has K-pop music videos playing on the TV & takes reservations if you can get anyone to answer the phone. Did I mention it's a BYOW? Just making sure. Staff is amicable but are easily distracted & not always attentive but they get really talkative if you use kakao talk. Prices are good for what you get. Word to the wise,don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach. The 10.99$ fried chicken comes with 7 pieces.

The food is delicious. I don't mess with a good thing & I always go for the fried chicken without any sauce,I heard that they are too sweet. It's moist & crisped to perfection on the outside. I have been tempted to try the oven baked chicken as well. The mandu (fried dumplings) are good but I've had better. The seafood & green onion pancake is worth it. The bibimbap has a decent amount of bulgogi in it. Thinking of trying to the corn cheese next time I pop in.

On the flip side,the ramen is meh & I wish they had more of the small side options that they bring before your meal is served.

Definitely worth going out of your way to stop by but not on Tuesdays,there are closed on Tuesdays.","['friedchicken', 'sundubujjigae']",

We were 4 on a Sunday night (October 2nd 2016) and we got a table right away. However around 6:30, people had to wait x 1 hour to get a table. 

I said in a previous review I really enjoy Korean food. This restaurant is over 30 min away from my place, but seriously, it was worth it !!! It cost about 50$ per couple, and we really really ate too much.

We preffered the garlic chicken to the regular one.
Absolutely loved the potato noodles (transparent one!!)
Bugangi beef was really good too.
I can't really give back comments, coz It was one of the best korean i ever had 
it's a BYOW, we didn't know before going. 

Will definitely go back.","['friedchicken', 'sundubujjigae']",

-Enjoyed the fried chicken which comes with a plain coleslaw type salad and ordered seafood pancake for starters. All A+++

-It gets quite busy around 7pm on Saturday so prepare to wait in line or get there earlier.

-Service was nice and polite, not overly friendly which is fine, but there was always a waitress whenever we needed one and that's perfect.

-Atmosphere is very plain but cool Korean music videos play on big screen so that's fun and different! Anyway, it's about the food and company, so NBD

There were only 2 employees working all tables and the cash so yeah, makes sense that service was slow.

After we put in our order, the waiter informed us that kimchi is extra for $1 whereas at the Downtown location, it was complimentary. The food was delicious but not as good as the Downtown one (probably because they have so many more employees so the food comes out faster). Loved the hot stir-fried rice cake - not too spicy, the vegetable dumplings, the kimchi, but the highlight is that friend chicken yum!

The plate of fries is huge! The fries are crispy and super long and super hot! 

I once tried their hot & spicy chicken with cheese and I was dying! Avoid at all costs! I love spicy and I could not handle it! The waitress warned me it was very spicy and I was like yeah don't worry about it! lol

I was told this place has amazing fried chicken! It's a little further away from downtown, but my friend drove a few of our friends here to eat. I ended up ordering pork and kimchi soup. I didn't really like my pork and kimchi soup that much, but the chicken was VERY good. Crispy with sweet and garlic sauce was definitely a good choice for me. The price of the dishes are also very good - I think my soup order was $8. That isn't too bad compared to other locations. Their side dishes are slightly more disappointing though - there was a lot of radishes and cucumbers, along with kimchi of course.

The place fills up quite fast at around 7:30 pm. Very reasonable prices and the waitresses were very nice.

Their specialty is the fried chicken.

Im a huge fried chicken fan and i tried it at many place and this place got me hooked!

One of my favorite place for this delicacy in montreal :)

The breading is rice based and it does give a nice crunchy and not greasy, that is why i like it.

The chicken has a little spicy seasoning in it which is a nice touch.

The bibimbap and tofu stew are really good but the fried chicken is a MUST.

I tried southern style fried chicken in the states my places and this korean restaurant is on the top of my list :)

Its a BYOW too which is nice to have beer and chicken.

I suspect they have a different standard for spicyness because I was dying. Everything was delicious though, but so spicy!
We had the sweet and spicy fried chicken, some bulgogi soup, the little red rice sticks and some fried dumplings. The soup was amazing, so tasty and different than Pho.

The flavoring is really on the spot and the staff is super sweet.
