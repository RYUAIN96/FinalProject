I contacted Groupon and they said the business has not let them know anything at all.  \r\n",

The hostess was very rude with an attitude. Then I asked for the Tofu with mushrooms, when I got my plate, un fried fish was on my platter. Thank God I am a daitery vegan and not a straight vegan. She removed the fish ( maybe she should asked if I wanted the fish). The soup was very blend with just water, hot sauce and (maybe) 1 full mushroom sliced. The kimshi were terrible as well. It's a no come back for me.\n",

When I finished ordering I went to sit down with my friend and talked to him. About 15 minutes passed by and I thought maybe my food was done. So I walked up to her counter and she calls on number 7 which is not my number so I sat down on the table in front of her. I looked and saw a cardboard box with food to go. I asked her if it was mine and she doesn't even look at me so I thought maybe it is not mine. I sat there thinking she will call my number since she called the other ladies number. Well I sat there until 4:00 pm thinking my goodness they must be making a fresh batch of stew. Well by 4:13 I thought wow there must be something wrong, I walked up to her and asked her if my food was done. She told me what did you ordered? I said number 1 and 4, she looks at my receipt and said oh it is In this box right here. I looked at her in disbelief. This box has been sitting here for at least 30 minutes and not once did she call my number. How rude and terrible is this service!!! Why are you even working there? Everyone who was sitting there saw me sitting there for at least an hour while everyone got there food. How can people be so rude when they are in this type of job? \r\n",

      "-the side dishes are absolutely atrocious. If you go to any decent Korean restaurant, you'll realize how bad it is here. The japchae (glass noodles) was bland and stale, and the kimchi wasn't fresh. Not much variety either.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "-terrible service--I was with Koreans and they (owner and waiter) focused on the other guests. I know why--they knew the Koreans wouldn't return knowing how bad the food is. \r\n",

      "==========\n",
      "The food here is alright, but the overall experience wasn't the best. Like others have mentioned, the service was pretty terrible. The owner was there and he pretty much came over to yell at us a few times for various reasons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First of all, it's not true AYCE. Basically they only let you order certain items for certain amounts of people. For example, we only had 3 people at our table so they wouldn't let us order the noodles. Okay - whatever. Also, they don't let you order a new item until all of the items on your table are finished. They gave us one bowl of soup and told us we had to finish it first before we got our second bowl. I get it.. wasting food is not cool. But I don't feel like we should be treated that way either. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, we were allowed to order 3 raw meats to cook. They staggered the meats to come out one by one so by the time we finished cooking the beef - which was quite quickly since we don't like to eat it well done.. the stove was left on and beginning to char. The server did not tell us we should turn off the stove, but I guess it is common sense to? But where was our second plate of meat? Well the owner wasted no time to come over and turn off our stove and yell at us and tell us we should be turning off the stove when we're done with it. Ok. Fine. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, the next plate of meat comes out. Pork belly. Which is 99% fat. And well, I guess you can guess what happened next. A grease fire. the stupid vent they have hovering over the stove wasn't good enough. And then you know what happened next. The owner came over to yell at us again. Opened the door and told us not to touch the vent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this point, we just wanted to finish what we had and get out of there. Definitely only walked in here because the place we wanted to go to was packed. And definitely won't come back here.\n",

      "Bonchon [Chicken] was one of my favorite places for Korean fried chicken in the DC area, so when I moved to Cleveland, I was upset that we would not have access to delicious soy garlic yumminess. After crying at night wanting nothing but seasoned fries and pickled radishes, I finally decided to look up the closest Bonchon, expecting to make a five hour drive. Then I saw the time the get there: 15 minutes! I thought to myself: is this a ripoff? Is this a joke? No, it was not. The same beautiful red Bonchon sign was shown, and I knew that my life decision to move to Cleveland was not terrible. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The restaurant itself: expect everything you would get at a Bonchon in Northern Virginia, but with no bubble tea and, how do I say it... different people... okay: more white people? It feels slightly different, but the food is the same. Come for the sliders and spicy tenders, and stay for the pretty good beer selection and plethora of TV screens. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So you don't know what Korean fried chicken is and you're scared? It's pretty much the crispiest fried chicken tossed in sweet and savory sauce. My advice: visit this place and never let it go out of business. If Bonchon leaves the Cleveland area, I may need to leave as well.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Came here when they were Newley opened. Pros, the patio is fabulous for this area where we don't have many options. The food wasn't bad and the beer selection was decent. Cons, the service was terrible. The servers were over worked while the owner stayed hidden. When I approached the owner he made mention that his bartender had been working open to close and so that might be why she was edgy while he went on to say that he had also been there all day but had slipped out for an afternoon drink. Despite the bad taste in my mouth I had after that, I returned once for the fried rice, but after getting my bill and seeing how much I paid for rice and a beer, I decided I will not be going back again.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I could have just given 1 star, but feeling generous I'm giving you two. Again, terrible attitude for the ordering service. I ordered a house stir-fried rice by phone and they gave me steamed rice instead. When I was trying to confirm the order the cashier rolled her eyes and said they only have house fried chicken rice and steamed rice. May I ask what's the difference between house stir-fried rice and house fried chicken rice? Besides, your steamed rice is in a container as big as a shot glass. Why didn't you confirm with me when I ordered the rice ? And rolling your eyes?\n",

Then about 15 minutes for a server, after we ordered everything. 15 more minutes went by and our first course was brought out to us. But, not our drinks. Kind of annoying. But, it is what it is. Fyi, our drinks were water. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After 45 mins, we got all of our food and started to eat. Food wasn't bad. The onion rings were flavorless. But, the wings were full of flavor. Even when they came up. That's right, about 2 hours after we ate and left. My husband and I became extremely ill. After the hour long vomit session. We could hardly breath because the heart burn and acid reflex was so bad. \r\n",

      "Not a fan of this place and definitely won't be back.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Give this place somewhere b/t 3-4 stars: price, taste, originality and location. First off, the prices are crazy overpriced.  The chicken is to die for tasty good. We ordered:\r\n",
      "Medium combo $23.95 for 5 drums and 10 wings (I know right!?). The taste is amazing, however, for $24 ridiculous in price. The drums and wings are medium sized. It's best to eat back and forth b/t the hot and soy garlic so your mouth doesn't burn up.\r\n",
      "Calamari appetizer - $14, overpriced and so blah and small portion, too much breading...we're still wondering if it was frozen. Don't order this as you can get so much better elsewhere.\r\n",
      "House Fried Rice add bulgogi - $13.95. This was a terrible rendition of good fried rice. So sweet, small portion and the bulgogi was paper thin and dry/overcooked. We threw it away.\r\n",
      "Salmon Avocado Ball: $11.00. This was awesome! Definitely, recommend and original.\r\n",
      "Takoyaki (fried octopus dumplings) $7 for 6. Very tasty and we ordered 2 orders. Not a lot of octopus, however, there was excellent flavor and creaminess in each dumpling. Try for originality.\r\n",

      "We'd go back for specific items...however, not go out of the way as depending on what we're in the mood for, (chicken or steak or Chinese or Vietnamese or Asian, etc), we can satisfy that through so many other restaurants all around.\n",

      "So keep in mind we are the only ones in the restaurant at the time\r\n",
      "Food was decent. We ordered the half original and half flavored combo which came with 4 side dishes. I enjoyed the original fried chicken which came with some sauce on the side and my wife really like their flavored chicken. The chicken was tasty with a nice mix of dark and white meat and not too many bones. Overall the food itself was enjoyable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service - so there was only 1 waitress at the time when we arrived and she was terrible. I understand if you're busy but being the only table you had to take care of there was no excuse. No explanation of the menu, I had to ask for water after nothing was offered for over 15 minutes, never came to ask if we needed anything, I had to get my own napkins when I needed extra. I think she spent more time working the tv then she did on us. \r\n",

Once we were seated 2 more tables came in and were seated and given water right away. When we were ready to order the girl was no where to be found. After 10 minutes we finally saw her but she took the orders for the other table before us. I always go to The fry, usually the Yonge st location and I love the food but I was very disappointed in the service at the hwy 7 location.\n",

      "Corn: I didn't realize that all the chicken orders already came with complimentary corn, otherwise I wouldn't have ordered the corn with cheese... I wish the waitress would have told me about this beforehand, would've saved $10. And since we ordered the corn with cheese, they didn't give us the complimentary side order of corn. \r\n",
      "The corn with cheese was terrible, corn was hard and not that sweet, and the cheese was basically a lump, it didn't melt properly and just sat on top of the corn. \r\n",

That is not an exaggeration.

Then had the nerve to tell me I didn't know what I was doing... when I left I had raw meat on the grill that took too long to cook and he tried to charge me extra ...

He said it many times regardless we were discussing what to do. We agreed that one of us will take turn to watch the kids but later on the waiter told me they can sit at the table. He told us that it will be an hour a wait but when our party got there he sat us right away. The food is good and fresh. Service is excellent.

We signed in our name at 4:45, hoping to eat by 5:30. The grills had a gas problem, they said it should be fixed within the next half hour. An hour goes by and we still don't get a call. We talked to the front desk and they asked for another half hour. We literally just went across the street and drank for 2 more hours WAITING to eat. We had a one year old who was throwing a fit by 7:30 so we walked back to check and we see the whole restaurant filled with customers eating. My husband asks the front desk why we didn't get a call, they flipped through several pages and said they were still going through the list, BUT WHY was our name in the front page with names crossed our before and after our slot? Also we had called several times during our wait, it just rang for 2 minutes with no answer. They didn't even apologize for making us wait for 3 hours, we told them to cross our names out and we left. Hopefully next visit will be better service.\n",

      "I had high expectations coming in which unfortunately fell short. It is not terrible but all means but in my opinion is not as good as its rival Buk Chang Soon Tofu.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PROS:\r\n",
      "- Pretty generous side dishes\r\n",
      "- Really silky soft tofu\r\n",
      "- Healthy purple grain rice served\r\n",
      "- Friendly service\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "CONS:\r\n",
      "- Expensive for portion served. $8.99 for all soon tofu across the board regardless of toppings, and even then there isn't much toppings when you order it. I think this compares to $7.56 for a soon tofu at Buk Chang. \r\n",
      "- Broth was not hot enough at all. I put an egg in and it did not cook... which was kinda a fail\r\n",
      "- Broth not flavourful enough and spice level off. Regular spicy was mildly spicy. Mild spicy was not spicy.\r\n",

      "Finally got to try this place after waiting all year for it to open!! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Definitely satisfied!!\r\n",
      "First off, their prices are so budget friendly. $9.99 for set A which includes 4 meats ($12.99 after 2pm & all day on weekends, but still really good price!). You can only get two meats per round with 2 people. I'm sure you can get 3 or more with a bigger group. \r\n",
      "My friend and I got this set and in it was the Brisket, Wine Pork Belly, Spicy or Mild Pork, & Bulgogi. We only ate the first three because Bulgogi is not our favorite anywhere really haha. \r\n",
      "The brisket was pretty good! Honestly, brisket is hard to mess up in my opinion. \r\n",
      "I was looking forward to the spicy pork the most because it is my favorite, and I loved it! Much better than Gen's (Tempe) spicy pork because it actually had a kick to it and the flavor was great. \r\n",
      "The wine pork belly was not like regular pork belly. It is very thin, like brisket. At first we were like uhhh... but it actually turned out to be my personal favorite! You can't tell that there is so much flavor to it before it's cooked, but when you taste it, oh hell yeah there's flavor. It was like a sweet and savory flavor that just melts in your mouth. Obviously it takes a little bit longer to cook since it's pork, but so worth waiting. \r\n",
      "Service was 4/5, not terrible at all. Sunday morning wasn't busy until about 1pm so we got pretty good service. We had to ask to get water refills the first time, but then they started to ask after they realized we drink a lot of water, haha. They are still learning, but are doing very well for just opening. \r\n",
      "My friend and I like to eat salad with our meats instead of rice. The only thing we wish for is bigger portions of salad so we didn't have to bother them 5 times for more. \r\n",
      "Also, we only got our grill changed once, and it was right before our last round of meat. We had to ask another waitress because no one was around to notice it needed a change. However, she came back after going to get it and said the grills weren't ready. And so we had to go for 2-3 more rounds with the same grill. I guess because it was still early (12pm) and they weren't done being cleaned from the night before?? \r\n",
      "Other than that, it was a great experience overall! \r\n",
      "Great alternative to Gen for broke college students living on a budget!!!\n",

      "So this place has amazing meat and seasoning for their price of $13. Unfortunately they are really understaffed which caused them to prioritize the people who purchase their premium package first. So I came here on Saturday night for dinner with my family and we had to waved down to the ANY server just to get a reorder of side, meat or water for the entire night. If Han was more staffed I would easily rate this a 5 due to their cheap pricing and great meat. My personal favorite from package A is the Fresh Brisket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ultimately I have to say if you go here during peak hours and order Package A you will be disappointed by the terrible service due to your priority compared to others.\r\n",

      "My fiance and I went here for lunch this past week because we happened to notice it was finally open on our way to lunch buffet. Food was good, not complaints about taste or quality. Even the 2 pork options were yummy and I don't generally eat/enjoy pork that's not bacon. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They seemed a little skimpy on the banchan offered and we didn't get all the sides I see mentioned in other reviews. Maybe they were out, maybe they rotate it... idk, but a big part of whether or not I enjoy a Korean BBQ spot depends on the banchan and this place could use more options and more of said options. Also, rice should not be extra... at least not the first bowl, but it's not much extra so I guess that's okay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only real complaint I had was the service... though I wouldn't say it was bad, it wasn't the best. Right off the bat when I tried to order boba I was told they didn't have it. Not they were out, but the lady straight made it seem like it wasn't something they offered and was clearly written on their menu. Pretty disappointed, but it saved us $5 buck at least? The next thing that irked me is the $9.99 lunch special we thought was going on for option A on their menu. We were there at about 12:30pm and were told that if we wanted to order the bulgogi under that option it was gonna be $12.99 instead even though that was losted as the after 2pm dinner price? I didn't snap a picture of the menu but there are some posted so you can see the confusion for yourself. We didn't bother arguing because we were starving when we went in, but they really need to make that more clear if that's the case. And lastly, granted there was only 2 - 3 people working on the floor, there was maybe that many customers when we arrived, yet they were not very attentive. The young girl working tried towards the end, but I'm pretty sure we weren't her table. The other lady only came by few times, we had to constantly flag her down for more banchan and meat and she never offered us refills (not even on the waters). And then towards the end she just dropped off our check without asking if we were finished. We could have probably done at least one more plate, but maybe it was for the best we didn't fill ourselves to the brim. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall not a terrible place and we will definately go back when we're in the area with a few bucks and a craving for Korean BBQ. Hopefully they listen to these reviews and can tweak some things to fix these minor inconveniences.\n",

      "We arrived at the restaurant at 7:50pm. It took almost 10 minutes for someone to even greet us. Mind you it was NOT that busy that night, there were plenty of waiters and waitress around with multiple empty tables. The host finally came and told us it will be 15 mins until our table was ready. 30 minutes later, still nothing. The people in front of us couldn't wait any longer and stood up and left. There were nobody cleaning up empty tables, and we were left waiting and waiting. My husband came and asked them when we could sit and eat and they said oh 10 more mins. 15 mins later, we finally got seater. The table was dirty, and the waitress had an attitude. We will never come back, the food was the same as any korean bbq place. But the service was terrible, TERRIBLE i tell you. If you wanna come to a restaurant where people treat you with attitude and ignore you, then go here.\n",

      "Went here for the first time months ago, but it will be the last time.  They up charge you for everything!  Rice?  Ssamhajang?  Side dishes?  Probably.  The quality if meat is terrible too!  I will pay the extra to go either Gen or Manna.  \r\n",

      "2. The grill was half way on and we told the server that only half was working but she said that she couldn't do anything about it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3. The salad we were served looked old so we put it aside. No seasoning was given for any of our meats unlike the other Korean BBQ places I've been too. The other sides were more like an after thought as they weren't really presented to us, more just placed at the table without telling us what any of them was.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",

It felt like flying spirit airlines....charging extra to breathe air. Honestly what they serve as pork belly shouldn't be served to a dog. The brisket had a freezer burn taste to it. You had to flag down someone for anything and everything ( literally didn't have them come over once) . It was a social party for the staff at the bar. I wouldn't go back to this place if it was free.  Anyone that gave this place a 4/5 star is either associated with the restaurant or has never had Korean bbq. I have never had a Korean bbq even close to this bad.\n",

      "I had a very bad experience here. My boyfriend and I went to this place because one of our friend recommended us to go. However, their services are terrible. After we found a seat, no one came to ask us anything for 10 mins. Then we went for asking for some warm water and saw if we could start to order something. The waitress wrote down the dishes we wanted and then never came back to us for 20 mins. People came after us got their dishes ready before us and you can tell easily that they spoke Korean. We went to ask when our dishes will be ready. The guy in the front desk told us that it should be very soon. Then we wait for another 10 mins and asked him again. He went to the kitchen and said whatever things that I completely don't understand (of course, coz I don't speak Korean.) and then came back to me saying that we need to wait for another 5 mins. We started to realized that they never truly started cooking our dishes!!!!! I have never saw a restaurant has services like this before. Very unfriendly to people don't know how to speak Korean!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We found out a big piece of the plastic wrapper in the dish that we ordered, the plastic wrapper was stir-fried and boiled with meat and vegetables in the frying pan together and it was melted down in the food. Most terrible thing was we ate more than half of the dish and found that out later. We were nauseated and threw up later and not feeling well at all after that and the next day. It ruined our dinner and time on that evening and even next day. It was the worst dish that I have had in my life. I still have goosebumps when I am thinking that I ate melted plastic... :(  :(  :(\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Its okay...nothing special, nothing stands out.  Like any typical Korean place, probably at a higher price point.  Didn't get the Korean pancake because it was $30.  Not sure why dough and mostly onion should be priced like that.  What we ordered was okay.  Came with 4 typical Korean side dishes.  It wasen't terrible but also nothing from the experience made me want to come back.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This place was terrible!  Banchan was limited to uncut kimchi and a really small plate of yellow pickled radish.  Main course took almost 40 minutes!!  They charge for rice when you order any stew.  What do they expect you to eat the stew with???!!\r\n",
      "If you ask for anything else like refilling your tea, good luck.  Ringing the button didn't help either.  You would be better off going to Gumi on Lawrence and Pharmacy, or Makalchon on Warden and Lawrence.\n",

      "I wish i could give them minus stars. I called in advance to see if they're open since it was Christmas day. They answered saying they are open as regular hours. We had 4 adults and 3 kids 5(7yrs, 2yrs, and a 1 yr old) we finally got to the restaurant and. they gave us the menu and gave us time to look over the menu. as we were ready to order one of the server tells us that their manager told them to close the restaurant. How rediculous is this? So \r\n",
      "We call the manager over to our table and she says I'll give you 30 minutes to eat. Seriously?? Do you think anyone can finish eating in 30 minites with 3 kids? She offered us an hour but how can you eat and enjoy food in an environment where you know everyone is waiting for you to leave?? We drove at least 40 minutes to have some food now we have to drive back an hour. This is a terrible way of doing business to begin with and the way that the manager handled the situation was absurd and unprofessional. I would NEVER EVER come back here again.\n",

      "Dakgogi has gotten seriously downhill. Their service has gotten from bad. To absolutely terrible. Avoid this place at all cost i would say. We were here on a tuesday and the servers were rude. And on top of it liars. We saw a booth and asked for it. And they refused claiming it was reserved. Afterwards another group came in and asked if they can get a table for 4. And they immediately gave them the same reserved table. Basically they want to cash in as much as possible. On top of it they refused to provide the basic side dishes they provide everyone for free. Usually at my previous two times of arrival. The food itself has gotten bad too. As they burnt the wings they fried. And on top they got the order wrong multiple times. For a 2 person table. Both waitress were like this so it was not just one bad waitress. They were never great on service but its gotten so bad. And the food takes so long to arrive its inexcusable. For a fried chicken place. I suggest everyone just go to the many other available fried chicken places in the area. And never come here. As your basically paying to be treated like crap. And given bad food\n",

      "My friends and I have been coming to this restaurant since high school, when it used to be called Turbo Lounge. Unfortunately, this place seems to have really dropped in their food quality and their customer service. First of all, their chicken was so dry and when we asked for sauce the waitress was reluctant to give us any. As well, most of the chicken pieces were mostly deep fried breading - including 2 neck bones pieces with no meat all - definitely not worth $26.99. The kimchi fries which I used to love eating, was really disappointing (very bland and the sauce was so oddly distributed - ex. a huge glob of mayo and a spoonful of kimchi thrown on top). In addition, my friend waved over the waitress, and we watched her walk back and forth (literally a cm away from my friend) outwardly ignoring her 5 times!! As well, not sure why they decided to blast their music like it was a club to the point where people had to shout to hear the person right across them. There were so many noisy tables (ex. people banging tables and girls screaming), and they did nothing about it. Lastly, even after this terrible experience, the waitress asked our table to leave to accommodate other customers - oddly enough there were a few empty tables, and we had a bill over $80. I definitely do not recommend this place - you are better off going to The Fry or Crazy Wings, where they had much better chicken and customer service!\n",

I took most the food home and offered it up to my kids and friends but after one bite no one wanted more.  Ended up throwing it away.\r\n",

My drink didn't get refilled even once, and my friend's food sat on the line for ten~fifteen minutes before they decided to bring it over to her. And the restaurant was pretty much empty other than our table, and two or three others, so it's not like they were super busy or something.

Lackluster sauces. Horrible service. Oh, and this is more of a personal preference, but they only had udon noodles and two rice types for what you wanted as your 'side', i.e the thing mixed into your stir-fry. Everything else was atypical stuff like tortilla strips and things of that nature.

To put that in perspective, my husband and I typically share meals.  Here, he gets regular and I get small.  The wait staff is attentive and friendly enough.  You may wait a little, but nothing terrible.  The buffet bar itself has food everywhere.  Several items that are dropped in the containers of food.  Which is understandable.  But there is no one maintaining it.  There are several men at the grill and the area is filthy.  One guy was pouring a bucket of dirty dishes into another bucket on the floor.  A couple fell out.  One of the cooks stepped away from cooking.  With his gloved hand, picked the bowl up off the floor, tossed it in the bucket that is on the floor and then stepped back to cooking.

We got the ramen to start--okay, we weren't expecting instant ramen, but fine it was $5 and somewhat hearty.

The banchan consisted of a small plate with two pieces of random things like kimchi, potato, and broccoli (??). It wasn't amazing, but the biggest surprise was that each of us got one such plate. Go to any other authentic Korean place, and a table would get one portion of each side separately. Yes, it's the same food in the end, but the implication is entirely different--these sides are meant to be shared among the people dining together, and preparing them on separate plates individualized for each person signifies a huge shift in the dining experience. I understand that they might be trying to accommodate for customers who don't regularly eat this kind of food. At a certain level, both patron and restaurant have to adapt to different customs (and that's a good thing for intercultural mixing), but I felt that the owners went too far in this instance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the entrees, we got the daeji bulgogi and buldak, both of which were rather mediocre. They weren't terrible, but I've had better at the aforementioned places in Pittsburgh. The two main issues were that 1) there was too much sauce on both plates, and 2) there were few other seasonings or flavors. For 1), it appears from the Yelp pics for this place that they're not very consistent--some appear drenched in sauce, while others actually look appetizing. We got the former, and that probably led to 2); the only taste was spicy, and while there were some onion and carrot pieces their taste was basically overwhelmed by the sauce. Other than that, the sesame was probably a bit overdone, and some scallion would probably have helped a lot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite all this though, I'm genuinely happy that this couple has made it this far. It's not always easy working such long hours as an immigrant family, but evidently they're making a lot of people happy. They've also put in a lot of work making the restaurant welcome to everyone (try to count how many pigs are inside if you go), so I hope they thrive as long as there are happy customers.\n",

Name of restaurant does not live up to what they serve.I don't think it's even Korean bbq .They marinate the meat in some simple way, a bit tasteless actually,  that is not typically Korean I find. Korean bbq marinated meat.... It's usually a bit sweet and packs a lot more flavor. The fried dumplings were actually quite terrible, the filling was mushy inside and had a bad texture. And the kimchi, well...I'm no kimchi expert, but it didn't taste very appetizing. It was not sour enough for my liking. Service was inconsistent. I was served by 6 or 7 different people. Dinner cost was overpriced. $21.99 for all you can eat. Plus was, meat seemed fresh, came in nice small portions. Service was also generally pleasant. Atmosphere was close to high-end, the walls changed colors....reminded me a bit of a club, Anyway I would not pay 21.99$ for this kind of food. I'd prefer to pay the lunch price which is 13.99$.\n",

      "We used to come here all the time several years ago when it used to be Takamatsu but have heard so many terrible things about Arirang about people getting food poisoning, the food being made with expired and low quality ingredients, so we avoided going. Recently, I heard that they changed cooks so my family and I decided to come try their dinner. First of all, their restaurant says it's a sushi bar, but they don't have sushi. Their side dishes looked dull in color and not very appetizing. We ordered mool neng myun which is a icy cold beef broth with noodles and that was lacking so much flavor. Even putting in vinegar, sesame oil, hot mustard, it was still really bland not very good. We also ordered bibim neng myun which is a spicy mixed noodle dish but the sauce was so bland, even when we asked for more sauce to put on the noodles, the flavor didn't change because the sauce was watered down so much. They also use super thin noodles that didn't hold up very well and it just wasn't good as much as we wanted to like it. The galbi seemed ok, my brother ate all of his order. The spicy pork bulgogi didn't taste very good either. The d챕cor inside is really weird, they use garden fencing as d챕cor. The music went from Korean hip hop to acoustic Justin Beiber and it was just weird. Overall, the experience and food was very lacking and we won't be going back. There are way better Korean restaurants nearby that have good food and better atmosphere.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I called the store to place a dine in order to for kalbi hoping by the time I get there, It will be ready in 5-10 minutes upon arrival. That was at 7:51pm For the call an when we arrived to the store an sat down, that was approximately 7:57pm. I told the waitress we had a order placed over the phone to dine in an she said no problem let me check if it's ready but never came back. Waitress never asked us what to drink or anything! I was pretty shocked! Another server stopped by an handed us the side dishes and walked away. At that moment, I didn't know who was my server at this point. At 8:13 a waitress passed by we asked if we can get water. She then went to the back an served us the water shortly after that. Now, 8:17 the food comes out. I was mind blown. The meat was not sizzling off the tray. Meat was cold an onions was not grilled. Now keep in mind I've been coming to this place before the new owner an new name. That entree is normally $25 in cost an has a portion to eat for two! The plate I received today was tiny for a child to eat, seriously. I asked to speak to the manager to the waitress an she brought him out. He ask what was wrong with the plate? I said honestly I called to order the food to have it ready by the time I get there. I was not expecting it to be ready as I arrived but did not expect my food to come out almost 20 min either. Plate was not hot, meat was definitely cold. An the manager looked at me with no intentions of apologizing. But he did have a excuse stating originally the cooks placed it in a to go box, and transferred it back onto a plate. So my question to him was, so my food was out while we was sitting an waiting the entire time? He said to me that's correct! Ooookkkk an I asked so what are you going to do about this an he said well I can remake it? That's not the answered I wanted, I was expecting an apology but yet never got it. I looked at him an was in complete shock on how he did not resolve the problem an told him I would not pay for the food nor service. He said ok an yet still never apologized an I asked if I can speak to the owner or get his contact number. He told me he was the owner. Funny because I went there a month ago an another gentlemen older told me the same thing which he was more positive in the store and checked on every table to make sure everyone was satisfied. So he was not the only owner an told him I wanted to talk to him. He refused to give me the contact an I told him flat out.... guess you are going to receive a yelp review by me! New name, and new owner.... I would never recommend anyone to eat at this place. The servers are all new with no serving experience, just like the owner!\r\n",

      "Funny how you can you can tell me you check the cameras an reviewed my comments but you can apologize  now but not in person? Sure you can say we ate 75% of the food as well when you have only 13 pieces of beef on the plate an I was accompanied with my lady. We can agree to disagree on the time the food came out on upon arrival although still the service you and servers gave us was terrible! Btw here is an image of the food from your competitor down the street from you, who served us Bulgogi. We left your company to eat at Gogi ( Better Food & Better Service) same night.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I am actually unsure if they changed to new management literally right after opening, but they changed their menu than what I had when I first went during their grand opening. Overall you shouldn't expect much other than super cheap AYCE KBBQ. The only reason why I'm giving it a two star is because they have terrible marinate for their bulgogi and they when literally some of the worst Kim chi I ever had in my life. I remember going here with my family on a Friday night at around 8 pm and we had asked for kimchi and our waiter said sorry but our chef is making some fresh kimchi... Overall when you are going here you aren't expecting quality meat but you can definitely get the most for your dollar. Although my rating is low I would go here again. \r\n",

      "I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, he was really looking forward to it and that made me excited as well! First off, the feel inside of the place is nice (minus a little table-congestion), but we were sat in the corner, even though the place was almost empty! I ordered a margarita and my boyfriend got a beer, my margarita was terrible, it was bitter and a weird mix between shaken and iced, very odd. \r\n",

      "The downfall of this place was definitely their service, my boyfriend and I were having a great time, until we ordered more food and asked for water.

The moment the server put the soup on my table i already smelled the non-freshness. It smelled terrible! I tried a sip and it tasted really wrong! i told the server that the soup tasted weird. The server told me that's because they made the soup in the morning and kept it boiling for a whole day. I'm like OK, but this just taste wrong. Then he told me his boss tasted the soup and it tasted perfectly fine, and just left. Well I don't know what the owner eat every day that he thinks the soup that went wrong already taste fine, but i have a normal person's taste so I'm not OK with this shit. My friend's kimchi soup also tasted weird. The tofu in the soup definitely expired. \r\n",

Jose was the server on that was taking care of us & he was extremely RUDE. He said if you'd like a refund you need to go stand back in line and get it settled!!!!! WHO DOES THAT!?!?!?!? Then when I said I ordered a side of tofu he said it's not on the ticket so you'll need to stand in line AGAIN & reorder. We were in shock. We moved to the FQ recently from Gilbert and love Pei Wei. We will never go back to this location. Absolutely horrible service & the people sitting next to us said it's always like this here. Just terrible.\n",

      "Once again, I had a terrible experience at this Pei Wei. This time, I ordered a vegetable Spring Roll and Ginger Broccoli Chicken with extra chicken and no scallions using the mobile app at 8:29 PM. Upon arriving I was greeted and told they were waiting on my spring roll. It was ready, they put it in the bag and I was on my way. When I arrived home, I found they gave me an order of Mongolian Steak with noodles that had been ordered by someone else at 4:29 PM. By this time, it was 8:55 and the restaurant was closing in five minutes, so I called and requested a refund as well as the name and telephone number of the regional and district managers. The person in charge was very nice, explained that she could not locate their names and numbers but did refund my money. Because I paid cash, I need to stop by the following day and pick it up. I have submitted a complaint to their corporate office, but the last time I complained (about leaving the store after 45 minutes of standing in a crowd of other people without being acknowledged, let alone served) I did not receive a reply, so I am not holding out much hope for an answer.\r\n",

      "My advice: avoid this place like the plague it is.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "It is what it is.  I like this Pei Wei (WARNING) just do not come here between 1115am-1230pm unless you want to wait for the business crowd.  Its  a favorite location due to being so close to starbucks and right off of 7th ave.  Parking is terrible during these hours also.  If you do want to come here for lunch during your work day I would suggest try getting here at 11am at least you wont have to wait long.  I usually call in and go pick it up if I cant make the 11am window.  \r\n",

Now perhaps I am a bit of a Chinese (Asian) food snob being from NY NY however one thing you can take to the bank is this... DO NOT GET THE ROAST PORK EGG ROLL.

We were seated next to a large group of non-Korean patrons when we first sat down and when they finished their meals and left, the 2 waiters that were cleaning the table were cursing at the b*tches that left a mess.

We were initially quite surprised and relieved by the price of the restaurant because korean meat is honestly not that cheap anywhere. \r\n",

However, it does seem to be pretty far from other cheaper and high quality alternatives (like the ones you  find near asian markets), so the price may just reflect the lack of neighboring competitors in this area.\r\n",
      "-The veggie pho option pretty much only came with tofu, regular onion, green onion, and cilantro, excluding your usual bean sprouts, mint, jalapeno that seem to come with every order of pho at most places. At other restaurants, they may include other veggies like broccoli, carrots, and peas or whatnot. It's not a big deal for me, because the pho was still delicious, but I think the price should be lower to reflect the scant ingredients? The veggie pho at the other aforementioned place was about $5-$6. \r\n",
      "-The boba was very meh. The smoothie flavors tasted exactly like the fake-tasting powders you can buy at LeeLees and the boba was a little too rigid. The chewiness was still pretty good. Not the worst boba I had, but far from the best.\r\n",

      "I won't be coming back, mostly because this was an impromptu take out adventure on our way out of town for a road trip and there's no way this place is convenient for us to stop by again, but even if I was overcome with the desire to eat pho, I would go to places with cheaper, better pho and better boba. I'm not giving it a terrible review though because all I got was take out one time. Don't get me wrong, if you just don't have any other closer options for pho and don't mind paying the higher than average price, then this is a solid choice.\n",

Walking in, you won't be greeted for at least 2-3 minutes and eventually a server will begrudgingly walk up and show you to your seat. The times I've went, the place has been pretty empty so I can't even attribute their slowness and lack of respect to being too busy. Every time I've went, they have forgot something we ordered but have always charged us for it anyways, even after flagging a server down and asking them about it. The most recent time we went, we sat at our table with empty dishes for about 20 minutes waiting for a server to come to our table but if never happened. We were planning to order a dessert but since no one attended to us we proceeded to wait up front to get our bill, which took at least 5 minutes for someone to finally ring us out. It wasn't just us either, every table around us received the same cold, non existent service. I always leave feeling like an inconvenience.

They never smile, they act as if every thing bothers them. They took the chopsticks holder off our table and set it at another without saying a word. Then when they brought my food out 20 mins later I had to ask for them back. The gentleman looked annoyed and grabbed a holder off another table and set it down at the opposite end from where I was sitting. Then continued to walk away without saying a word. Absolutely terrible service. Even when my boyfriend and I had stated that we were waiting for my food even though his had been brought soon after we ordered, the waiters acted as if it was whatever. My boyfriend waited for my food but they took so long that I told him to eat. He finished his food before mine even came. Un-freaking-believable. No empathy, no apology, nothing.

We were asking the other people that worked there for our server and he never showed till the end. We would raise our hands and completely ignore us. The tables next to us were visited more than us.

They said that add-ons automatically upgrades it to a large which I wasn't even told. However when I looked inside the bowl, there wasn't even any tendon! I'm fairly sure they messed up my order and forced me to take a large. They finally came by with some tendon after multiple requests and it was terrible.

Also food has gone to shit as well. Maybe a notch down from mediocre. WE WILL NEVER STEP FOOT INSIDE THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN. Shame on you foe Kim long.

Our server was fine but her manager Lam (or Lamb?) was a nasty person. I heard him speak so negative to our server using profanity for something that was his fault. A customer should never hear that nor should an employee be crying because of bad management. I hope the establishment takes note because we go there often in large groups but it's not worth someone suffering  over. I hope this guy gets what he deserves. As a business owner I can say he would have been let go a long time ago for his attitude and bad work ethic.\n",

We had 7 people in our party, plus a baby, and it took for-freaking-ever to get a table. We also came during the dinner rush on a Sunday, so it was understandable. We waited at the cramped and overwhelming seating area at the entrance and were finally called for a table after about 45 minutes.\r\n",

My family ordered a couple plates of gi cun (fresh spring rolls), roasted chicken with garlic, shrimp fried rice, and five bowls of pho. The food came out really fast, which seemed a little suspicious to me, considering how crowded the place was! First of all, the spring rolls were extremely small compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to and the rice paper was hard and difficult to chew, as if it had been sitting out for a long time waiting to be served. The spring rolls definitely weren't fresh. Second of all, the broth in my pho wasn't very hot. It was just warm. Third of all, the shrimp fried rice was extremely bland. There wasn't much flavor at all. Somebody pass the soy sauce!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I was eating my pho, I started to remember why I enjoyed my previous visit here. I came here with my cousins at 3 in the morning after a long day of getting crazy at Life Is Beautiful. Of course anything tastes good when you've been on your feet all day, you're intoxicated, and half asleep, right? Needless to say, the food is just okay, not really satisfactory. The quality isn't there.\r\n",

They were definitely understaffed for the amount of customers they had!\r\n",

It become immediately obvious how terrible the service is and that some of the staff clearly don't value their jobs, or have the slightest I understanding of what customer service is.

The wait was longer than I would have liked but at 20 minutes it wasn't too terrible. I ordered two items, fried calamari and the special combo pho. The pho was good and had I only had that I would give this place a four star rating. However, I also ordered the fried calamari and that was pretty bad. The squid itself was overcooked and the seasoning was very bland earning that plate two stars.. Overall, I would go again if I was in Vegas and it was late, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go.\r\n",

Waiting for a table has never taken long, but forget getting refills on your drinks or checking on how the food is. Your order is taken, your food is brought out, and good luck finding somebody to bring you the check. You basically have to wave one down like a taxi.\r\n",

If you're feeling adventurous and try tasting some of the other some 1000 options on the menu, such as pad thai or beef and broccoli (slight wtf, isn't this Vietnamese?) it's a real crap shoot. 50/50 chance of getting something solid tasting.\r\n",

I tried to order fresh coconut juice but our waiter said it was sold out. Then I chose the thai ice tea. We got our pho orders. I then asked about my drink that hadn't come, and another server said it was sold out. THEN I see the table next to us and they got fresh coconut juice.

Probably the rude hostess and her friends working there did something. Rachelle the hostess was THE WORST at checking in and seating customers. if you see a lady with red hair and blue eyes, do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else. She never greeted any of the guests, and even worse, she let the only 1 guy who just came through the door get a table when me and three other families were waiting for 20 minutes!! She was flirting with that one guy for some time while she ignored the 3 other families were waiting to get checked in! When one father was getting mad at her not paying attention and flirting with the guy, and checking his family in, she had the most disgusting attitude and told him to wait- terrible at customer service. Also, when i called her out and asked why we were all waiting longer than other people, she had the audacity to tell me off by saying to eat somewhere else. Oh and not to mention that she didn't even give the family seated next to us any menus whatsoever. Talk about lazy service. What a shame. I've been going here faithfully for years and service is going down the drain. Did I forget to say how it took me FIVE times to call a waiter to get boxes for my leftovers? And don't expect anybody checking you frequently to see if your dining experience. They clearly made eye contact with me and ignored me, particularly the ones whom the hostess would be talking to. She's turning this restaurant into a high school vibe with all the rude and immature employees. it's ridiculous. The one star is only for the nice lady who checked on our waters and my family enjoyed their pho.\r\n",

I do agree with a few of the other posters in regards to asian customers seem to get better treatment and food.

Broth is a make or break thing and a good pho will have those amazing multiple layers of anise, coriander, fish sauce etc. this broth was missing something. Couldn't put my finger on it, but the broth did not have the flavor explosion I am accustomed to in pho. I wasn't bad per se, but I've had waaaay better pho. Bland. \r\n",

My family ordered 2 bowls of Pho, shaken beef with rice, grilled pork with rice and crystal noodles.  They taste okay, still edible but not terrible.  The beef is very very small portion.  The quality need to improve.  The quality is tasteless.  Fail big on customer service.  The guy bring out ours Pho slam the 2 bowls down the table which make a really loud noise.  In addition, the lady bring us the bill point out the tip amounts there are on the receipt.  This is not very polite.  She keep asking me if she can charge the tips on my credit cards.\n",

No one is attentive to their guests here, you have to chase two or three people down in order to get your water refilled let alone any other need you have. Sucks but I'm breaking up with pho Kim long. It's not me it's you.\n",

      "I am not sure if this place has come under new ownership, but my last outing here proved very disappointing. Up until recently, this place was my go to after hours food spot in Vegas. However this past time, I found myself unimpressed by the pho, which is surprising since the pho in LA is subpar for the most part. the spring roll also seemed haphazzardly prepared and lack any real flavor. It didn't help that the service was also terrible. VERY IMPORTANT: Call a cab when your entree arrives as there likely won't be one waiting for you between 4- 7 am. if you go to vegas and stay in chinatown, this does not apply to you.\n",

Fast forward to the present and their service is above average for your typical Vietnamese restaurant. Always quick and friendly. The vegan pho is amazing and normally ready in under ten minutes, sometimes five. Highly recommended. It's nice to have a 24/7 option. The city that never sleeps definitely needs more of those. \r\n",

      "If I could give them 3.5 then I would, but Yelp just doesn't let me. This is an update: For a while, we always suffered from a terrible headache after we had pho. One time we asked if they put MSG in their food, they confirmed they do. So, be careful if you are sensitive to MSG like us. The service isn't as good, but I expect that. They never really come back to fill up our waters, sometimes they just drop the check on the table when we haven't even gone through half of the meal.\n",

However, we went for a large portion of the meal without water, because no one took the time to come back to our table and get us water, even after we had two people show up later and get their food ordered. The icing on the cake was when we finally tried to pay our bill. We ate as a large group, so we asked to get our bill separated. The waiter told us, very rudely, that we couldn't split the check. We paid and we got the hell out of there. \r\n",

When I opened my food. it looked more like pad see ew than pad thai. I hate you Noodles for keeping me hungry and getting my order wrong. I was very upset with this place. I had to pay that much and get treated like a nobody. Noodles will not get any more business from me..\n",

They don't have the price listed on the carts so you are more likely to grab a bunch of overpriced items. Each tiny dim sum dish starts at $7 plus. Although I did enjoy their spare ribs and minced meat in fried footballs, neither were something I was dying to have seconds of.

I would've been disappointed in the flavor even if it was an instant noodle soup.  it was just salt in the wound that they were each 15$ - not terrible but definitely not a deal.

Where I'm from it's like $5-$10 max wherever I've been.  Pretty ridiculous pricing here if you ask me.  And the pho wasn't even great; it tasted plain.  My friend got the cucumber salad.  When the waitress brought it out it looked like a side order or extra stuff like cilantro that you'd put on your food.  Plate was hella small in portion.  And it cost $8.  So glad I didn't opt for salad this time.  I would've been super disappointed and pissed.  I ordered the fried rice which cost $15-16 bucks.  I was so happy with this order compared to the rest.  It tasted decent and It was bigger in portion LOL  I did have to add a lot of hot sauce to it and peppers.\r\n",

The couple 3 seats away got there after us and they were eating before us.  Over 30 minutes to get an app isn't acceptable in any circumstance.  What's worse is we got no information from the server.  Yes, this is supposed to be in the style of a dim sum house, but we are still in Vegas, spending an exorbitant amount on pre-made dim sum so I expect proper service.\r\n",

      "The food was ok.  Not the best, not the worst.  The flavor of the duck was great but the pork was dry and seemed a little old.  The dan dan noodle soup didn't taste like a dan dan noodle inspired dish but once I added chili paste, it was good.\r\n",

      "This is my second time here. This visit was quite different than last time. We started with the shrimp dim sum and ordered udon and the spicy noodle dish. All of that was about a 3.5 star. But here's the kicker, the kimchi was terrible. I mean it is so old and fermented they should be ashamed of theirselves. It was inedible and honestly about 60+days old. When we gave feedback to take the dish back, we actually got an attitude from the server and the manager. Don't be offended, just take the dish back, offer a replacement or just take it off the bill. Too easy right? And last throw all that out and make some more. For $7 I could buy a whole jar freshly made.\n",

The hotpot isn't that great personally. It does lack flavor and the bibimbap came out cold. I didn't like the specials with the bulgogi either. Pretty average. The service is terrible and the place is quite dirty\n",

However the meats tasted fresh and tender. \r\n",

What kind of all you can eat place do such a thing !?After about 1 hour, the server told us 'it's a last call' which nobody mentioned us about the time limit before.

      "Having mentioned to a local chef/friend a week prior that I'd been wanting to further investigate the local Korean dining market without being forced to rely on K-Town BBQ as a 'reference standard' I was admittedly a bit surprised to hear him suggest 9 on the Plate - a restaurant I'd driven by daily without paying second thought while stationed in temporary housing, but one whose low priced tapas-style menu seemed perfect...a restaurant.com certificate further sweetening the deal to the tune of four impressive plates and a complimentary trio of condiments for less than $30 after tax and tip.  A large, modern space with terrible music but superlative service and a well culled menu as yet lacking desserts it was just after 6:30pm when I arrived and finding the space devoid of other patrons for the first fifteen minutes I spent some time picking my servers brain prior to placing an order and deferring on suggested bugoli in place of personal favorites from his long list of suggestions it would not be long before dinner began; a welcoming trio spanning flavors sharp, spicy, saline, and umami awakening the palate for things to come.  Moving on to plates ordered as more guests arrived and having requested dishes arrive in logical progression it was the fluffy crab pancake that arrived first and laced with peppers the sweetness of the crab proved an adequate foil, a touch of soy bringing flavors to a point and transitioning well into the sweet, sticky wings - undoubtedly the plate of the evening and something I'd love to see the restaurant adopt in whole bird form once business picks up, though a subsequent course of crispy pork belly served with simply pickled vegetables was nearly as impressive...particularly with crispy glutenous rice cakes in thick, smoky 'ketchup' riding shotgun.\n",

      "Cool, funky place located in The Park Road shopping center. Excellent service, friendly employees. I ordered the Pad Thai with the chicken and shrimp. Too many noodles and not enough shrimp and chicken for me. There were A LOT of noodles. I couldn't finish my bowl. Not sure why, but within an hour of leaving I had terrible stomach pains and had to find a bathroom (sorry, gross). I may return and try another dish. We shall see.\n",

We had to send crab & pork spring roll back because it smelled and tasted terrible.  SUSHI ROLLS: we tried a couple and I would go elsewhere.  But I have heard that the pad thai here is awesome, so I would like to go back to try that!\n",

      "I'm glad I gave this place another try after my first experience (first time was near opening of restaurant and service was terrible!).  This time, service was great and food was even better.  Shared pork dumplings, pork belly buns, edamame spring rolls, and short rib banh mi.  All were delicious! I would recommend all of those items except the spring rolls -- they were a little bland.  Not bad, just not memorable. Side note: they don't take reservations so that's annoying.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "It's okay. Service was kinda wack. Took 40 mins to get dumplings and an additional 10, about an hour, to get our food. Fried rice was ordered without certain ingredients but it came with ALL.  We were hungry so we accepted what was presented at the time since it was the only thing sitting at our table.  The server avoided us bc of the ticket time but that should never be the case.  The Korean bbq sandwiches (bread) was fried. It made it extremely greasy and soggy.  Honestly I would never return.  Due to the fact that the restaurant tried to replicate what Charlotte already had, which did not succeed, but the service was so terrible that we could not even place another order since the food took so long we were afraid of being late for our other obligations.  Plan on being there for at least 3 hours to be full.\n",

      "It's not often that I eat out and feel the need to review something immediately!! However I feel sick... not sick the food was bad, but sick because I ate too darn much haha! My bff and I have decided that we are going to try to visit a new restaurant, (aka new to us), once a month. We started tonight at CO because our slacker selves hadn't exchanged Christmas presents yet. I know, terrible!! I should preface this by saying I love Asian food, minus anything alive or particularly squiggly, I'm into it all and this menu has a bit of everything. I ordered the Orange Blossom cocktail to start while I perused the menu. It was delicious and sneaks up on you while you drink it. I also later tried the pineapple/aperol drink. It wasn't as good. We took a long time to order because we couldn't figure out what to get (we wanted it all), However order we did. To start with I got the spicy crab Rangoon and she got the beef and kimchi dumplings. Both were really good, but be warned the Rangoon comes out molten hot (I burned the roof of my mouth lol). We couldn't decide between sushi and an entree so we decided we would each get both. I went with the pressed spicy tuna roll (good but not mind blowing), and she the caterpillar roll (she said it was good, I don't like eel). Now when it comes to entrees I hands down made the better choice! I went with the Korean rice bowl and it was so, sooo good, seriously the beef was perfectly cooked and all of the veggies were flavorful. The pickled carrots were love!! My bff went with the chicken Katsu banh mi. She liked it, but if I was her I would have had food envy!! Then we got dessert (did I mention we ate way too much food??). One tip, currently if you check in on Yelp you get an offer for a free dessert. We went with the cheesecake wontons, and they were amazing! Four small perfectly portioned wontons with what can only be described as orange blossom cheesecake, and candied orange rinds. I personally was in heaven. \r\n",

      "The decor was nice, but not very comfortable. I seriously hate this trend of everyone having just high top tables. I'm short, not graceful, and I can't get in them without looking like an idiot. Luckily by the front window they had regular tables with little square cushion seats without backs. Overall I liked this place a lot... our waitress was nice but REALLY slow on service. You could tell she wasn't into it, I get it it's a Monday. So 4 stars it is, and I think I absolutely would come back for the rangoon, Korean rice bowl and the cheesecake wontons!!\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The broth itself came out lukewarm and wasn't flavorful - tastes like you could buy a box of it pre-made in a store. I ordered the raw beef which came in huge slices that were tough and stringy. I've never had to spit pieces of pho meat out before, but I had to here several times. \r\n",

There are many times, however, that we choose to go someplace else entirely because their wine selection is terrible.  I'm not sure who is picking the wine (red) but we have tried all of them and they are all either too sweet or have a medicine like after taste.  We are not that picky and are just looking for a decent red wine.  Maybe let some of the staff choose some favorites next time the distributor comes in.\n",

It is supposed to be all you can eat, and you can order everything on the menu except the Prime Rib Eye, which you can only order once.  We have no problem of that.  Since we were both pretty hungry, and we weren't supposed to order more than one order of rib eye...we tried to ordered something else that was on the menu.  OMG, we both noticed that both of the food servers didn't wanted to come by our table after that...and we had to tracked them down to order something else.  Not to mentioned both food servers had turned their attitude to so rude.  Hey if you guys can't afford to let your customers eat, you shouldn't never order a 'All you can Eat' place, right?  We have also tried other Korean BBQ on Spring Mtn and S Rainbow area.  In fact, we have been there many times...none, I meant none of those food servers have ever acted like that before.  This place is absolutely terrible.  Besides, the items on their menu are very limited...unlike other places...a lot more items...and definitely much better services.\n",

      "Updating yet again after my last trip there had a very disappointing experience, and so I was forced to drop my rating again.  As usual I ordered the jajangmyun, Mandoo, and kampoonggi.  As we are sitting and waiting I start to realize that my eyes are burning and watering significantly.  At first I chalked it up to being tired, but than my partner said that his eyes were burning as well.  As we looked around we noticed that everyone was having issues.  I asked the waitress what was going on and was told that they were peeling onions and there was nothing they could do.  Unfortunately this made the experience of eating in a terrible experience.  We basically just wanted to eat our food and get out of there as our eyes were burning beyond belief.  We ended up packing most of it up and just leaving.  It was a very disappointing experience to say the least.\n",

Takes about 10 minutes just to order drinks and another 10 to order food unless you flag down your waiter. My friend and I both ordered the same thing and her food came out 15 min ahead of mine. My sister ordered a deep fried sushi roll and when it came out she noticed it wasn't fried at all. When she asked the waiter he stated that they changed how they cooked the roll but haven't updated the menu. We finished eating and sat for an extra 30 just waiting for the bill. Currently I'm still waiting for our bill. The couple next to us has been seating for at least 20 min and nobody has been by to ask them what they want to drink. HIRE MORE PEOPLE.\n",

      "Awful. Waited ten minutes for waters then waited another 15 minutes for just two rolls. The food did not taste fresh at all and even the fish in the sushi bar window looked terrible. The waiters would stand right in between my boyfriend and I and shout over our heads to the sushi chef behind the bar. Was totally awkward and rude and just plain weird. The miso soup was hot and didn't taste bad though kind of bland. Overall Bad experience. Will not go back.\n",

I picked at each of them a little, but I didn't want to go any further than that.\r\n",

Maybe they need more servers, but we had to work super hard all throughout to finally get their attention.

We had no side dishes served, we asked a few times to set the table (utensils, cups), they served only partial of our food.

      "I really don't get it how come this place has such good reviews. Cause what me and my friends have experienced at this restaurant was terrible. First, I ordered the most expensive meat as far as I remember on the menu but I got served with $5 quality very thin pork chop when it was supposed to be Pork kalbi ($23.99 per order). I was so disappointed that I had to talk to the owner. However she wouldn't admit it and or care about my comment and asked me right away if I wanted anything else instead with an attitude. It's not like I asked for free food or anything but I wanted to know how kalbi turns into pork chop here and charging that much of money. Obviously judging from the meat I ordered I didn't want anything else. The service was so slow for the whole time we had to ask waitresses or waiter more than twice which was so annoying. We never went back ever again as there are way better restaurants in the area with better service. Also my friend went to the restaurant after few days. Apparently the owner again refused to give more soup for my friends and her family only because it was supposed to be free for one table, doesn't matter how many ppl seat on the one table. Only one soup for a group. So my friend asked if she can pay for the extra soup so that she can order more and the owner said NO and walked away. Hope this review helps the restaurant to improve better as well.\n",

The presentation, service, and food were all above average and well worth it. I still can't get over the price. I've been to KBBQ with higher prices and terrible service and poor meat selections. Though the  menu isn't extensive, what you do get is amazing! You have the option of having a bar grill (you have to ask) but if you're scared of fire then maybe just stick to the original grill. All of the servers were super attentive, articulate, and well educated on their menus. Give it a try but expect to wait! I'd definitely come again and hope everyone has a good experience as well.

      "I'd never heard of the Flame Broiler, until it came to the Tempe area. According to the shop's website, the founder is Korean and when he was working right out of college, he couldn't find a healthy place to eat so he started this place and it has grown and spread ever since. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, firstly, the taste of the food is decent. It's not incredibly yummy, but it's also not terrible either. I had the mini bowl of chicken and vegetables and my friend got the beef and chicken with brown rice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the whole concept of Flame Broiler is that it serves healthy food, I would say that it's not really healthy since the meats are doused in salty sauce. There are several different kinds of sauces that you can put on your meal. The Magic Sauce is like a soy sauce/teriyaki sauce blend. The hot sauces are kind of strange tasting, mostly because they're too tangy/vinegary.\n",

      "I'm all about fast casual healthy food for lunch. I've been here since the doors open and it has progressively gotten worse in terms of being efficient and clean. Today was the end of my trips to Flame Broiler. The kitchen looked terrible, food every where from all over the counter to the floors. If there was a manager there then the franchisor should really consider coming back and taking some ownership. I don't know if the food is still good as I cancelled my order after waiting 15 or so minutes. I hate giving bad reviews, this could be my first one, but simply saying sorry doesn't cut it for me.\n",

      "I have eaten lunch there 3 times in the past few months and thought it was pretty good. $18.00 lunch buffet isn't bad for what you get.  However, I ate there last night with my wife who loves Gen Korean BBQ and I told her it was very similar, but we both had a disappointing dinner.  Dinner buffet is $25.00 and no different than lunch. We ordered Spicy Pork bulgogi which was mostly fat.  The garlic chicken was terrible, not sure if garlic season was gross or the chicken was just sour.  Probably won't do the dinner again and hope the next visit is better but it felt like a waste of $50.00 for dinner.\n",

      "How disappointed can we be?  This was horrible. Not just, we just opened and are working out the kinks bad...I mean just plain awful. The side dishes came out and there was water in our potato's, the sprouts were not ripe, and the dumplings were soft shelled and still frozen.   When the meat came out the kalbi was literally flavorless outside a touch of gaminess, the bulgoki was ok, and our chadol baegi has been obviously shaved and THEN frozen. This means all the little shaved slices stuck together and you ended up with a hot mess. Two of my wife's pieces actually had freezer burn and was almost grey. At that point she was done and we just wanted to leave. \r\n",

I am very picky when it comes to bossam and actually really enjoyed the dish here - their meat quality was perfection.... HUGE slices of very tender pork belly. The radish to pair with the pork belly was deliciously seasoned as well! \r\n",

      "- Nakji Dolpan (Spicy Octopus Hot Stone Plate) - $13.95\r\n",
      "So I will be honest - I was misled by myself. I totally thought this was nakjibokkum (just stir fried spicy octopus) but when this dish came out, it was in a huge stone bowl filled with rice, topped with spicy octopus and other veggies. It was kind of like a stone bowl bibimbap but with a helping of spicy octopus on top! The server encouraged us to mix it all up before the rice turned crispy around the stone bowl. I honestly was not a huge fan - it lacked flavor but definitely was a filling component of our meal. It wasn't terrible but I don't think I would order it knowing what it is next time! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Nangmyun & Bulgogi Combo (Cold Buckwheat Noodle Soup and Bulgogi) - $15.95 \r\n",
      "The nangmyun was probably the best surprise of our meal. This usually tastes pretty horrid at restaurants - but my friend I was eating with insisted we try it and get this combo. The presentation and ingredients were typical (bed of buckwheat noodles in cold broth topped with beef, cucumber, radish, egg) - and the taste was surprisingly good! It was refreshing and the ingredients weren't too strong (that's the issue usually with this dish at restaurants - too much of something added that ruins the entire bowl). I wouldn't mind coming back for the BOGO! The bulgogi on the other hand was not memorable. Tasted more like teriyaki beef. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would describe my experience at Si Jang very pleasant and the food pretty authentic. Staff is super friendly, very attentive, and food came out quick. The banchan (sides) were on point - I personally love the seaweed w/ spicy sauce - and they provide a good variety and will quickly replenish upon request.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

Today was for lunch.  Cheap plastic furniture starts it off. We sit down at a table that was soaking wet and a older guy comes over with menus. Ten minutes later he brings us water. Five woman come in and sit down.  He brings them water. As he walks by I ask him if we can order. Nope he goes and takes the orders for the 5 women who of course get there food ahead of us and we now are there over 30 minutes.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      " I absolutely love the food, and the only reason it doesn't have five stars is the service. It's not terrible and they've never screwed up my order or anything, but it's not the greatest I've ever had. I recall waiting a few minutes with an empty water glass before I could resume eating because I was thirsty. I'd rather wait for a refill than not eat at this restaurant though.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One thing to keep in mind, this place is small, and it gets busy, so if you don't want to wait for a table, go at an off time like during the week or for lunch. Dinner time on Friday or Saturday night fills up pretty quick!\n",

      "The Pho Tai was terrible...the broth was oily & the meat was fatty.  Not just a little bit of fat, but globs of floppy nasty fat.  I have never had to pull the meat out of my pho.  This excess amount of fat was gross (and I'm not even usually picky about fat).  We've had a lot of pho, but never something this bad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I really wanted to like this place.  The decor is cute...all Ikea furniture and cool art on the walls.  They played pop music.  Service was friendly and the place appears to be family owned.  Our egg rolls were good, but we only got 3 and most places usually serve 6. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The price was ridiculous!  We ordered our usual...2 bowls of pho thai (1 large & 1 small), 2 drinks, and an order of egg rolls.  Most places we've ever ate at charge between $20-$25.  For this nasty meal...we paid $34!  \r\n",

Did not know how much change to give, and was pulling it out of a wallet as if he was fumbling to give change to a homeless person. He even had the nerve to brashly ask me,  'So how much tip will you give me?' I gave him a tip so that I didn't have to deal with him anymore. Food was colder than the service.\n",

Then she came back to tell us that it was my fiance's, when it didn't even match the length or colour of his hair! She walked away, ignoring our response. No apology, and then refused to listen at the end when we wanted to tell her that we felt insulted she tried to put the blame on us. I've never encountered such arrogance. Aside from that, the food was bland and I wouldn't go again, even without the terrible and uncomfortable treatment we had to endure.\n",

      "Food was great and portions were big, service was terrible i wouldn't go back. The server was texting on his phone the whole time and sitting around. Also when he took my order he didn't write anything down and i ordered 4 items and a bottle of rice wine for the table and i already knew he was going to forget because he didn't write anything down. Sure enough i watched him punch in the order then he sits down and starts texting on his phone and 10 mins go by and no drinks until i flagged him down to remind him.\n",

I've only down a handful and most are 5 stars. If it's not that good I just let it roll. Not gonna ding a restaurant unless it's clearly terrible!!! And if it is good over most I make sure to give it 5 star to promote it and keep it going. Look bottom line wings where hard and nasty and squid was worse as mentioned. I tossed it in the garbage and had to make another order from another restaurant. Money wasted and now I have a stomach ache!!!!\n",

The broccoli was soft and I could bend the stalks easily. Same with the carrots, I could bend them and they looked dry. The napa cabbage was bruised and brown - like someone used them in a recreational activity. Not one thing was fresh. I couldn't stomach buying any produce there. \r\n",

Also took us 3 tries to get a server to come, waved them down but made eye contact but didn't acknowledge us. Happened 3 times but he went to serve another table that sat after us.  Finally another server came to check on us when the other table aleady gotten their banchans.

I normally never finish anything at congee restaurants and feel terrible about it, but this time we nearly did! It is definitely a good place to have some lunch food. Plus, the waitress was really helpful and patient with us, because I could not decide what to get. She warned us that the plates were going to be big, which is to be expected, but still helpful.\n",

Service here was quick, we always had our water filled and our food arrived in orderly time. I ended up ordering the bulgogi bowl ($11) as I saw many photos of it on yelp.

Thankfully the bulgogi wasn't dry and it was lightly seasoned however; I wished it had more flavoring as I was expecting it to be very marinated. The bowl also includes vegetables, however; I had an ABUNDANCE of onions and a little cabbage which was very disappointing.\r\n",

Normally whenever I go to korean restaurants, they offer at least six side dishes so seeing only three was a disappointment. Personally, I didn't like the kimchi. Yes it had the spice factor but I found it to turn bland after munching on it. I like it when kimchi has an after taste of it being either sweet or sour; but this had none of the above.\r\n",

I found one mussel, one hoop of squid, and there were a few pea sized clams. \r\n",

Option A (19.95) but I wanted the steak so option B was perfect for us, but both options have a lot of variety within them selves so regardless you would be complete. Immediately once our order was taken, our side dishes were on there way. Each one of the sides dishes were delicious, perfectly seasoned and the kimchi was marvelous! It wasn't too acidic which we've had and it overall had great flavor! We ordered that four times! The meats came out shortly after and each item was of better quality!

Their bibimbap is sooo good, not too salty, each side dish has its own flavor, and doesn't leave you feeling terrible about what you ate.

She did not seem happy to work there. She did not like that we were not ready to order 5 minutes after sitting down.

So it was not even st half capacity. It took them 25 minutes to get a ginsing chicken out and a record time 35 minutes to make a tonkatsu. Now you would think with the amount of time it took. It would be mind blowing and amazing. Unfortunately not only was it not. The food was below average at best. The ginsing chicken. The chicken was rough and overcooked. The tonkatsu was absolutely terrible. The meat was so thin it was like literally paper thin. And thr batter was poorly placed. Now you would think with such subpar foodm this place would be cheaper. But it wasnt. They charged more for both tonkatsu and ginger chicken then all the other restauarants around the area. Such as yonge and finch. This restaurant is an avoid at all cost. It has bad food. Bad pricing. And long wait times.\n",

It included a depressing looking lettuce salad that tasted like it had been languishing in the presumably hot kitchen so long that all the crispness of the lettuce had died a sad, untimely death.  It did not include carrot, cucumber or any of the side vegetables usually found in bento salads.  The pork was well sliced but it didn't have enough chili flavor to it.  It was also lukewarm.  \r\n",

When paying the bill we left a $3 tip as we didnt stay too long and recieved barely any service. The lady came by as we were about to leave and told us that the tips not included in the bill, and expected U.S. to tip even more. This was mad because she provided us next to no service.

The service was well paced, the food quality was excellent, the side dishes were always filled, the water was refilled promptly, and the pitchers of beer were nice and cold. I thought for sure there would not be enough food especially since they recommended we only order 2 of the 2 person combos even though we were are party of 6. I was fully prepared to add more food. We were pleasantly surprised that there was the perfect amount of food especially with the extras that came with each combo. The steamed egg and tofu soup that came with the combo were yummy. I've had better kimchi pancakes, but it was still a nice extra. The person cooking the meats for us was very attentive and cooked everything nicely. As she cooked, she kept an eye out for getting our side dishes refilled. She told us which meat she was cooking each time.  The variety of side dishes were great. The seasonings on the beef and pork were not overwhelming since there was no need to hide poor quality meat like some places. I didn't have to drink a ton of water like the cheap places that season heavily. The presentation of the single person dessert (kind of a snow ice) in a martini glass was cute but $7.50 is a little steep.  It tasted pretty good though..\r\n",

The range hoods were not super loud and worked as best as any of the bbq places can. Yes it's a little pricey but we felt it was worth it. Maybe because it was not busy or maybe we lucked out with our server, but we had great service. A lot of people like Hobak, but we had terrible service there and we didn't like the sides at Hobak. The quality of the meat is the same.\n",

The intolerable part was that half of the food that we ordered never came to our table. For example, we ordered rice and miso soup more than 3 times, they were never brought to our table during our 3 hour stay. We also ordered drinks several times and even personally asked the waiter for the drinks, and still managed to bring the wrong drinks. The vegetables we ordered were also lost in the abyss.\r\n",

      "I don't think I need to elaborate much more on the other reviews so I will keep it short and simple. The food was actually very good but the service was a joke! Bringing us all kinds of plates we didn't order, grill not turned on, not bringing us drinks we ordered, no menus, etc. But the kicker for us was when the waiters ACTUALLY tried passing and balancing a drink tray right over our heads as we were eating! I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't been there. That is an egregious service faux pas. I jokingly think that people might actually come here just to see the circus of incredibly terrible service for their own eyes, and eat good food while doing it :)\n",

It was debatable whether the food would give us food poisoning or Salmonella but after the meal I was considering I had both. The Crispy beef was black and was probably one of the worst dishes I have ever eaten. The beef ribs were alright and the only thing there that even approached average. At any restaurant these ribs would be the worst thing served but here they were the best while still terrible. We barely had our water refilled the whole night. This restaurant was sickening and gross and should be shut down.\n",

The Korean soups aren't remotely close to what it's supposed to taste like. The meat were very poor quality. The owners are not Korean, which is not a problem, but you can't just buy table grills ,any meat, and call it Korean BBQ.The services had very bad attitudes and created a negative atmosphere for customers. Their behavior felt like they wanted us to leave already, because it's an all you can eat. The most outrageous thing that has happened in my trip to Montr챕al is when we all paid the bill; the server stopped at the table and started counting the bills.I didn't believe the waiters provide excellent service, so I gave 10% tip. He asked me to give 15%, which is the rudest thing you can do in a restaurant. I gave him his 15%, but I would never recommend to anyone to come here. I believe people who gave 5 stars to this restaurant never had good Korean BBQ\n",

The first time I came to Gogi was on a weekday night.  it wasn't busy yet it took probably 30-45 mins for any food to come out. That included the rare meat I had to cook also. Whenever something was ordered, it was missed and I continuously had to re order everything. The food isn't as bad as the service. If they served amazing Korean barbecue.. I still wouldn't even come here because of the service. This happened the second time as well. Now only during the second time, the servers were too busy cleaning tables to get out early at the end of the day that they also missed my order. I have nothing great to say about this place.\n",

There's only two table customers(include us), each table have two people, totally 4 person. There was one waiter at that time, and he can not serviced well. I do not know whether he didn't like us or he was just came into this field. When we asked for sauces, he only gave us one little tiny plate sauce, excuse me? We have two, ok? And you can not waiting for him to come back when you asked for something few minutes ago, because he will never remembered what are you talking to him before. We finally gave up, just finished the meal, the happy mood is no longer. When we finished and billed at the front door, waiter gave me the Pos machine without any words, no eye contact, no thank you, impassive expression...we pay for almost one hundred dollars and extra 15% tips to taste your BBQ, and we just swiping card and leave, maybe we just your ATM in your mind.\r\n",

We didn't get have the sides everyone else got,  we were trreated so rudely and spent over $100 and just wanted to have a nice evening, rude, cross contamination utensils at the table, using tongs with raw chicken to move beef on the grill and the remainder of my evening was being sick all night and I am still in bed right now, They shoud be inspected by the health department, I want a refund, we have both been sick and vomiting all day and still sick\r\n",
      "Stay away from this restaurant they are predijuce, don't know how to properly serve raw food for customers to cook for themselves, and use the same scissors to cut my raw chicken as my cooked beef, THIs should be agains the law.  DOn't waste your money on these pushy rude business owners with no proper food control, No wonder we have been sick all night\n",

      "I would give a negative star but  a minimum of one star is required . My husband and I are an interracial couple who received horrible service and were discriminated against at this establishment. At 12 o'clock in the afternoon the waitress told us we could not order from the lunch menu, only the dinner menu. A Korean couple came in 30 minutes after us, and had received their food 15 minutes before us. When our food arrived the soup was bland, the waitress never checked with us and didn't even bring our bill. At check out, the owner added a five dollar tip on our bill, I had inquired about why the five dollars that were added, and she told me that every table has to pay tips. We left the tip on the table already despite the lack of service we had received. Some of my friends went to the same restaurant and they had a $10 tip added to their bill because they had four people. I would never go back to this restaurant and I will do my best to inform my terrible experience to anyone who is a minority and thinking about eating at this establishment.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The food is good but the service is terrible. No matter how many times I wave to the 5 waitresses I saw, no one came except to take our order, deliver our food and bring the check. So I guess there is basic service. There were only 5 side dishes, few considering it's a BBQ restaurant and the prices they charge. The my beef stone rice dish had literally 3 pieces of meet for $15.95.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This place is terrible. The dish is low value but overprice, and the service is bad. I won't recommend  it. What's more, they put 20% tips on the bill and forced us to pay it which is fine, because we thought that will be our last time visited there. After we paid off the bill which include 20% tips they forced us to paid, they said we haven't pay the tips and asked us to pay tips. omg never even been to a restaurant like this. DO NOT GO THERE!\n",

They served a sauce which was sesame and sweet vinegar for it, but it was just alright. The dak bulgogi had decent chicken and the yetnal bulgogi had decent quality beef, but it wasn't marinated enough....it just had a hint of the marinate flavor that the menu described so it need to sit moreThe chap chae was good, but standard. The portions were decent, but isn't really good value. It's doubly more expensive than I\r\n",

Definitely not for those who are craving real legit korean bbq but will definitely satiate the meat addicts. Unfortunately the service was not so favorable. The lady actually cracked a joke about friend which was quite rude and unprofessional. The servers weren't tentative to the customers and seemed to be lacking the service aspect of their jobs. Not to be mean judgmental or mean but in all honesty, our service was terrible. Also the pricing per person was ridiculously expensive. But I can understand why, seeing how this is like the only all you can eat korean bbq spot in a 200 mile radius.

How? Read below:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1. She managed to squeeze the 5 of us in a four-seat table by placing an extra chair along the walkway (she didnt have the idea that its a fire hazard!!!). Apparently its not an option to combine two tables.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2. She only gave us 1 tong. We tried to request an extra because its 5 of us sharing . She said that its only 1 tong per table because there was no dishwasher (what an illogical excuse! We dined there to eat and enjoy, not to hear her complains. And I mean, how hard is it to wash a single extra tong? OMG!!!)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3. Because we were crowded and were only using 1 tong, one of my friends burned his hand and spilled the coke all over the place. We asked for cleaning cloth or mop but she instead gave us a roll of paper towel(they probably cannot afford a janitor and a mop. Whatever the reason was I dont wanna hear about it!). My friend told the girl that we need an extra tong especially that were 5 in there. She didnt have the choice but finally gave an extra tong shes extremely afraid to wash herself!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4. No refills on soda and water was given until were done eating. Why? Because the girl and the other guy who works there were just chit chatting right at the corner like they are guests themselves in a posh hotel costes lounge.\r\n",

      "5. When paying the bills, she said she cannot give receipts if payment is cash. She said thats not how things work in their business.

The lady who works there in the afternoon is very nice and welcoming with an excellent customer service. But the asian american girl who works during happy hour needs a proper training. Im stating a fact here, based on my experience, not mare fabrication or made up stories(what will I get anyway?). I dont have major complains with the food(its okay, I dined during the happy hour) but my complain is the service from that asian american girl(I dont know if shes the shift manager incharge that night).

      "My friends and I were out shopping at Ulta and decided to give this place a try! We're glad we did.  We started out with some of their specialty cocktails. I ordered the Orange and Blueberry smash and it was worth the price. They are generous on their whiskey pour and you won't need to order another one. One of the girls that was with us is vegetarian and the other gave up meat for Lent. Neither one of them had a hard time finding something on the menu. One friend ordered the salmon tacos and I immediately had regrets about my order. Delicious and you should definitely order them! I ordered the southwest salad and added chicken. It was not my favorite and wish I had went with the brisket with a side. I can't wait to go back and actually order some of their BBQ.  I think the server was having a bad day because our service was pretty terrible.  I think she even forgot about us when we asked for our check. I'll definitely give this place another try. Loved their background music...a lot of 90's grunge which is a WIN in my book!\n",

      "Took us a while to try this place because we were still kind of bummed about the fact that Mama Fu's was one of our favorite take out places and we were sad to see it go. Went with the kids (12 & 9)  and sat at the bar on a Friday night. Found the service to be good and we order a good spectrum of the menu to really try the food. Started with the fried Kale. It's Kale and its fried and its Kale and let's move on... Next up was the  improper charcuterie. Ribs were a miss (dry). Brisket fair, pulled pork was good, sausage was good but unremarkable. Pimento cheese nothing to write home about. Next up was the chicken nachos for the wife. Sent it back because the pimento cheese was cold and then we were informed that is how they serve it so it wouldn't congeal. Well I guess we just don't know how to eat pimento cheese properly but that dish was not very good. The chicken in it was quite tasty but the cheese.  next to the kids. Son had grilled pimento cheese sandwich took one bite and was done. Daughter had mac and cheese and said it was terrible. Now I know what your going to say that kids can be picky eaters, but we like to eat out and don't mind traveling uptown, Southpark, Noda, Plaza midwood... Wherever there is good food to be had. We eat out 2-3 times a week and have tried a lot of cue joints in town. When your kids put a good dent in a hot box of Krispy Kremes on the way home and the wife still has to feed them when we get home!.. Well we probably won't be back anytime soon.  On the bright side local beer was good.\n",

Weather they have gone down hill with the added interest or what but it was not good at all!  We got the PROPER CHARCUTERIE.  First the BBQ & Brisket had no smoke-ring to it, very dry!  The ribs were almost burned they were so overcooked.  The small corn muffin tasted like the ones you add water too- so no flavor and cold?  Kids got the BBQ sliders, same reaction to the BBQ.  The Mac and Cheese was good but room temp as well.  We got the icecream sandwiches to share which were really good but took them over 30 minutes to get them to us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let's talk terrible service!  It was horrible!  The server never asked for additional drinks so apparently one beer and one water are your allotted amounts.

It took us over 2 hours to eat dinner at a BBQ place!  What????\r\n",

Attentive, fast and clearly knew the menu.  This was not the case with our server today. After we ordered food, our server didnt return to the table until our food was up. Which usually is fine but our food took so long that i was sipping on melted ice by then. I then had to ask for more soda. After that our server stood in plain sight talking with some other servers until Ann(the server we had the first two times) came up and cleared our table and asked jill our actually server to get our bill together. \r\n",
      "As far as food goes some things are good and others are eh... The salmon i had last time was cook perfectly and seasoned well. The collards i didnt care for but they're vegetarian. I dont think ive ever had vegetarian collards before. The little corn muffin was terrible. This go round i got the half chicken. Was a hair on the dry side but was good. Little extra bbq sauce fixed that. The jalapeno grits were amazing! Pasta salad was very bland. I mixed the pickled onion into it with a little salt and pepper. Made it so much better.\r\n",

I had the Bourbon Blackberry Tea, it was awesome, strong but not overwhelming and the muddled blackberries at the bottom . Boyfriend had the OMB Copper beer. But every time we ordered anything.. another 10 minutes. The girl told us they were short a server but we counted about 10 servers it wasn't even super busy so we were a little irritated. Maybe she was new? I had the Chow Bao taco with brisket. It was super tasty, delicious tender meat and Mary B's BBQ sauce is the bomb!

It tends to get busy especially considering it's in the First Markham Place plaza, but nonetheless service will always be slow. Typically the small side dishes will not be brought until the entrees come (so you don't fill up on them hahaha). I typically get the gamjatang with cabbage which usually comes with sufficient amounts of pork bone and cabbage, plus the standard bowl of rice. The soup is pretty flavourful with spices so no complaints there. When if comes to the potatoes and gnocchi, it's pretty hit or miss in terms of quantity. There's nothing special about any of the dishes, but they're  not terrible. Accommodating for bigger groups, but service and food quality are sure to not to please anyone in those large groups.\n",

      "First and foremost, the service was terrible. The food was passable (we got the bibimbap and gamjatang), but the appetizers were flavorless. The waitress who served us seemed like she didn't want to be there, and every time we needed something it was like we were interrupting their conversation. When we asked for the bill, she ignored us to finish her conversation, making us wait. Complete lack of customer service. \r\n",

There was no jjang but at least it came with fresh lettuce and some vegetables to grill. Making my own sambap were good. The kimchi jjigae was disappointing, it was so sour you couldn't eat it. The tteokbokki tasted like teokbokki which is a good thing. \r\n",

They couldn't even get the side dishes right... It tasted like nothing even though it looked like it was drenched in sauce and seasoning. Usually order the bulgolgi and Gamjatang (excuse my incorrect spelling) whenever i try a new place... Lets just say the bulgogi tasted like it was marinated with NOTHING and the pork bone bone soup looked like it was seasoned with NOTHING. the stars are merely for service and quality of the restaurants interior.\n",

It didn't taste like it was seasoned at all which was unusual for me because most food from all over asia is rich in flavour. The noodles didn't really have any special characteristics either.

      "Honestly, this is NOTHING compared to Kbbq in the Bay Area or LA. Sushi Kim was actually my first Kbbq experience, and I'm certainly glad that I now know what real Kbbq is like. Instead of ordering meat, you get to pile your plates high with meat buffet-style. The meat often gets stuck and burned onto the grill after a while, but they won't clean it out or switch out a new one for you. The meat juices will trickle down into the middle, so I recommend cooking your vegetables there so they have some flavor. Unfortunately... the sauce also gets burned easily onto the grill. \r\n",
      "\r\n",

The portions have shrunk substantially, the bulgogi came out cold and oily.  The rice in the BiBimBap had no crispy edge to it.  No lettuce was provided with the bulgogi until we asked for the 3rd time.  There were only two small sides provided with the Bulgogi, sprouts and kimchi.\r\n",

You can forget about having any sort of service during prime time especially if you don't speak Korean. You'll find yourself waiting with no acknowledgment and others coming long after you will be seated before you. On many occasions we've found ourselves alienated and left with no choice but to walk out the door because of terrible treatment. Don't get me wrong, if the restaurant is not busy, you may be pleased with the food. Just a word of caution, for mediocre food and terrible treatment I'm confident that you can find a much better alternative down the street.\n",

The sides were all 1 star for me the pimento cheese corn dish was bland and sweet which i did not care for nor did anyone else at the table. The collards were undercooked and bland as could be. Next was the alleged broccoli salad which was blanched broccoli and chile sauce terrible. Our service was wonderful very atentive always full water glass and never an empty beer.

From the time it took to get our drinks to the 40 minutes it took to get our food even though the tables on both sides of us ordered after we did got their food before us to the service. It was just a mess. And the management told us there was some confusion in the kitchen (whatever that means) and that was why we didn't get our food. When we got our food it was delicious which is the only thing that made it tolerable. The manager gave us 20% off which I feel like is unacceptable considering I waited 40 minutes and two tables I know for a fact ordered and were served before me. Additionally our server didn't inquire about why our food was not coming until we brought it to his attention. It was just underwhelming overall. It will be a long time before I come back to this place and I'll hope the service is better but I won't hold my breath.\n",

Only to cancel it or wait 35 minutes for it to be ready (I guess tofu and a potato takes a hell of a long time). After which I had to wait 30 more minutes on Cathy to come inside from partying with them people outdoors because she's the only one that can cancel an order. So I waited over an hour for no food.

Perhaps that's because there were a lot of people there at the time and there weren't enough workers to handle the crowd. The food portions were very meager. It's also the first Korean restaurant that charged extra for a bowl of rice that always comes by default if you order soup. Four of my colleagues said the food was okay and one said it was terrible. I though it was decent. What really sucked was that when I asked to split the bill (for reimbursement purposes), the owner appeared very upset and frustrated.

The last time I ate there with my boyfriend, we ordered sashimi and it was served completely frozen through. I understand the concept that sushi is frozen and then thawed, but this was barely thawed on the outside and crunchy and frozen in the middle. I decided to give it one more shot tonight and ordered a sushi roll with some soup through Uber eats, but when I ate a piece of the sushi (the fish in it was yellow tail), I almost gagged. The yellowtail was absolutely rancid and brown. It smelled and tasted terrible. The manager wasn't interested in me returning the sushi and insisted that my only recourse was to go through the delivery service (although it's not their fault), but that's a shame because he just lost two customers that have been fans of hibiscus for years.

At first the servers were great and friendly with helping us but then after putting the first selection of meat for us it went south. We tried to cook the first plate that came out since we were told by another server to finish so they can bring another plate out. So we tried to cook the meat but then another server was noticeably pissy  by our placement of the meat not being on the center of the grill which we didn't know it was a no-no. We've been to AYCE KBBQ places together before so we're used to just placing it wherever but there are just things you can say in a different tone to not show how peeved you are. Then we got the other plate and another server has to comment on us to move faster. By the time we finished we waited for the longest time, about over 45 minutes for our bill to come. This is after we helped the runner clean our table completely and it was the runner that I had to ask for the bill from or else we would've never gotten it. So much for helping and rushing us.\n",

I didn't have expectations that it will surpass Kang Hodong in LA, but was expecting at least close in par with Hobak here in town. The bonchon was superb, they brought over 16 different items, and all of them more or less is very good. No complaints there. But unfortunately, that was actually the highlights of my time here.\r\n",

      "We got the beef combo, which consist of 5 plates of meat. Each plate has a small amount, but the quantity even though not as much as Hobak, is more than enough for 2 and perhaps decent enough for even 3. The meat themselves all seemed high quality, they're all thinly sliced and looked fresh enough. However, it's not really about how good the meat is but it's how you cook it right? Out of my favorite places on the west coast, Kang Hodong in LA and Hobak in Vegas, they all cook for you, making sure you don't screw up the beautiful meat in the process. This place claimed to cook for you when I sat down, but they seem to leave for a long time after putting down the meat, and by the time they come back, the meat is already over cooked. It's not like it was crowded when I got there, there was only 1 other table at the time. I asked for medium rare, and the 1st 3 plates were all medium well to well done, which just in my experience ruin the reason to eat KBBQ. \r\n",

I don't think you can pull unmarinated meats unless you have the perfect meats, otherwise you should just stick to marinated meats. Hobak does not pretend that they have the perfect meats, and even with imperfect meats they manage to pull off amazing tastes. They also do better soybean paste soup and the steamed eggs. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the decor of this place, which mind you is VERY well done, to the unmarinated meats, to the service, I feel like this establishment is pretending to be something it's not. There's nothing that stands out either completely great or completely terrible about this place. However, I've definitely spent less money at other places for a more enjoyable KBBQ meal. It's a shame that my first experience wasn't a more satisfactory one, but I was certainly hoping it to surprise me. Perhaps my expectations were too high.\n",

      "My review is based on our 2nd visit.\r\n",
      "We took a friend to dinner.  The waiter had a terrible time trying to communicate with us.  In the beginning we all were going to have Bulgogi.  He suggested we try different things.  Well every time we tried to get a suggestion of something else, we got nothin.  My friend decided on a pork dish.\r\n",
      "After cooking the Bulgogi at the table, the waiter asked my friend John if he did not like meat.  My friend said yes but was waiting for his pork dish.  The waiter had a duh expression on his face and finally remembered that my friend was supposed to get pork not Bulgogi.\r\n",
      "There are 1000's of restaurants to choose from. Next time I'll choose somewhere else.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "So sad to see this place turn to crap!  We've been going to Goong since it first opened and have always raved about the place. My husband and I have our date night one a month at Goong and we've always loved the food and the service. Well, the service is still good but the food has really gone downhill. For the last three times we've gone, slowly but surely they started eliminating some of the side dishes (namely the Korean potato salad and then the green papaya salad), then the meat portions started getting smaller and smaller, and finally, the quality of the meat was just awful on our last visit. We always order the Wagyu top sirloin and the tenderloin and they were terrible: fatty, gristled, really tough to chew.  We complained to our server who just smiled (yes, I said smiled) and did nothing to correct the problems.  She never offered to replace the bad meat, or offer us other side dishes, she just smiled and walked away.  Maybe a language issue????  Needless to say, we won't be back. Sorry Goong, three strikes and you're out.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The food was good but the service was terrible.\r\n",
      "My family ate here several months ago and the server messed up my brother's order but she didn't even apologize for making a mistake on his order. Never dining here again.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "First off I'll say that this place has AMAZING decor for an HK cafe. It's clean and beautifully decorated. It's very modern looking from its purple seats to its flower decor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'll skip the Japanese, HK, Korean thing since its already been more than established by other yelpers. The menu items are pretty much the same as any HK cafe, but some of the typical classic dishes have been swapped with some Korean and other fusion ones.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We ordered from the happy hour menu; spaghetti and fried pork chop with fries. The food was really good. I wasn't expecting the spaghetti to taste that good, but then again I almost never order spaghetti at an Asian restaurant. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The shortcomings of this experience were due to the bbt, and service delays. While the staff was friendly, food took forever to come out. It felt like there was only one waitress and one cook. My gf got her spaghetti 20 minutes before I got my pork chop. It was not a happy wait. Aside from that, their bubble milk tea was terrible. The milk tea itself wasn't too bad but the taste was off, and the pearls were chalky and stale. That was pretty unsatisfying since HK milk tea is one of my favourites.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the end, I'd probably come back. The food was good and the atmosphere was nice (not noisy like most HK cafes). They just need a little bit of tweaking.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This is a great spot for Korean shaved ice and some snacks. The shaved ice is nicely sized and a regular size can definitely be shared between two people. I got a matcha red bean and got a taste of their signature Injeomi (brown soy powder) shaved ice. The flavours and toppings were great and nicely complimented by the delicate shaved ice (which actually looks like snowflakes). It's nice to eat shaved ice that doesn't turn into a watery mess after 1 minute!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The menu needs some updating as they actually do sell Korean fried chicken. While the Gangjeong flavour is nice (not too spicy), it was a little expensive for the small portion that they offered. \r\n",

      "The toast was pretty standard compared to other Asian dessert places. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This place gets busy at night (and the parking lot is terrible), so try to get here early! Also, make sure to ask them which flavours of shaved ice are available as some have been discontinued.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I want to give this place half a star but it don't have that option.  Terrible service, terrible location,  all chairs are broken, tables are too small, the drinks taste like garbage.  I can get better for instant coffee you get at supermarket.  Never will come here again.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Well, they're back open and wow, what a world of difference with the service. The staff is wonderful, we ordered a lot of food between 5 people. With appetizers and everything, the food came out promptly and without error. I know that's not saying much, but again, if you ate here before, you know what a shit show it was. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not much needs to be said about the food, it's korean fried chicken and it is really, REALLY delicious. Lightly breaded and fried with 2 sauces to choose from, and apparently now they have boneless wings too. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you haven't eaten here before, it's a definite must try to delve gently into the world of korean cuisine. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And for those that HAVE eaten here when it was under the old management, GO!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I ate different Korean restaurant before this is the worst place, food taste terrible and 4 orders charged $100( price higher than the other Korean restaurants),I can tell it's not real Korean food, I definitely not go back this place\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I was excited to try this place because I LOVE Korean food, having lived there for a couple of years. I walked in and the interior was very nice and modern with Korean pop music playing, mixed with other pop songs. The waitress was friendly and I was really looking forward to a great new restaurant to tell my friends about.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, the first sign of trouble came when I noticed that they charge $1.50 for kimch'i. I have never, ever, ever seen a Korean restaurant charge for kimch'i. It always comes with the meal, even if the cost is built in to the price, you always get kimch'i with your meal. Seeing that made me realize that there likely would be no other side dishes either, like every other Korean restaurant serves (and there weren't.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lunch menu is very limited, but reasonably priced. I got the Bibim rice. I've had worse food in my day, but that's hardly a rave review. They make it with a patty on top, which was seared nicely but something about it tasted strange. I would have preferred the traditional way. Also, it does not come with an egg on top, so I had to order that for extra. The meal wasn't terrible, but it rates at the bottom for Bibimpap I've had in town elsewhere. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So to sum up: Atmosphere - great. Service - friendly, albeit understaffed. Food - substandard. I likely won't return.\n",

      "Located in the food court straight back. You'll know when you see pictures of pizza.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "R.P. is right. The customer service here is above and beyond. The Weekly article had the wrong hours listed (K-Jun closes with the rest of the food court, 9 p.m. on Saturdays). We came in at 9 thinking we had plenty of time. The young gentleman behind the counter, being well-informed, knew we were there because of the mix up. We said we would gladly return during business hours. I mean there's a million great places to eat around there. He then blew my mind. He said he would stay late to make us a pizza. What an insane offer! I felt terrible taking it, but he insisted. So my food companion tipped him well to make his time worth it. He let us order the $20 special. It had a pizza, chicken and two drinks. It's advertised to feed 4+ and it definitely did. He was so generous that I was scared he would get in trouble. I bet he would be the most best friend you could ever have. Someone like this man is such a gem of a person. I would want him to be my partner on Survivor. He even checked on us through our meal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food though is really cool. Korean pizza, HELLO! The bulgogi potato pizza had bits of bulgogi beef, corn, potatoes and other things I'm sure. The pizza sauce was an orangey color and tasted like pasta sauce. The crust seemed to have plenty of cheese  crusties- gooood. It was pretty alright. I wish it came frozen for me to take home. Don't judge me. We had our chicken half plain and half in sauce. I never had chicken like this. The crust is really thick and crunchy. We couldn't put our finger on it and at last we realized it had cinnamon. How cool! We devoured the pickled radishes that came with it. The kind man said they are perfect together. Oh, and he was so right. I love hiiiiim! The other half had a sticky spicy sweet sauce on it. It was good, but I personally prefer the plain. Too messy. The actual chicken pieces come small, but were not dry. I did come across the occasional bone which I find nostalgic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So if the Weekly made you curious like me, you should go. I'm remembering and cherishing the time with that chicken , radish and pizza. I'll be back.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Food: 2 stars\r\n",
      "The second star really is for the abundance in side dishes (banchan). None of the side dishes were outstanding but it's nice to have a variety. My boyfriend ordered the jab chae rice. It was a little on the sweet side but it was a good portion and it was alright (at least he didn't complain about it). My mom ordered the beef ramen and there were literally 2 small shriveled up pieces of beef. I'm surprised they actually served that to our table! We kindly asked for more beef to be served on the side. I got the gamja tang ramen and I was super excited for it too because that's two of my favourite things together! Why didn't more Korean restaurants think of this?! Or maybe I just haven't been to the right ones. Higher the hopes, the greater the disappointment. Firstly, not much meat on my pork bones and they weren't tender at all. I have read in other reviews that there was a lot of meat so maybe opt for the gamja tang without ramen? Most disappointing was the lean meat. Healthier option, but I wouldn't be out eating gamja tang ramen if I was looking to improve my diet. \r\n",

      "Service: 2.5 stars\r\n",
      "SMILE, PEOPLE! I don't know if it's just that waitresses have terrible days or most of them hate their jobs at Asian restaurants. You don't have to be outright nice and polite but a small smile makes a difference. All I can say is, service wasn't bad and our waitress did what she needed to do.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This is a borderline ok place for a quick bite but there are a lot of better places with better prices. The side dishes were plenty but they limit side dish refills to three dishes after. I ordered the Kam jang tang and noticed it had onions and other ingredients you don't normally see at other restaurants. It also had a slight sweet taste to it which was weird. My sister got bulbogi bibambap and that was pretty plain. The egg was also overcooked (runny yolk is always a must for us). \r\n",

Food was yummy, however out server was terrible. About a 20 year old girl with rings in herr face and bad makeup and attitude. If you wanna charge a premium price for food it should be served by at least a competent server. I spoke with some of my co-workers about our experience when we got back to the office and basically the same problem, mostly young inexperienced servers who do a poor job. Now some people did say they had more mature servers and the experience was awesome, unfortunately that was not ours.\n",

Everything about the meal from the many many delicious side dishes to the perfectly marinated and tender bulgogi and short ribs was amazing! Prices are very reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get. And on top of a perfect meal, the service was unbeatable. You can tell the staff really work as a team and help each other out to make sure each table has the best experience possible. I will absolutely be recommending this place to all my friends and family and I can't wait to return! \r\n",

      "After my most recent visit I felt the need to update my review. I am just blown away by this place! The food is always outstanding and completely satisfying to any craving you may have for Korean bbq! Visited today during lunch to find they have many good deals on lunch specials so prices were extremely reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get. Ordered the beef bulgogi which never disappoints! However this review is even more based on the staff. The customer service is outstanding and I love that there is such a family feel to it. Came here with my 2 year old (which we all know is not always easy when they're in their terrible 2's lol) he started to get a bit fussy but not once did I feel out of place or like they were annoyed with us which is honestly such a relief when your child starts to throw a fit in the middle of lunch. The table busser at the time along with one of the waitresses were extremely friendly! The waitress in particular who wasn't even our server at the time (and I wish I got her name because she was so awesome. She had braided hair and a gold nose ring) was absolutely amazing!! She stopped by our table to chat with my son, and after asking if it was okay he had some ice cream she took him to the back freezer, let him pick out what ice cream he liked and then presented him with a yummy plate of ice cream whip cream and chocolate syrup! My son was so happy and mom and dad were even happier getting to finish our meal in peace with him finally calming down lol. She wasn't even our waitress but simple stopped by our table out of kindness and I'm so appreciative for that! Kindness like hers along with the rest of the staff here should not go unnoticed! 5 stars over and over again!!! Thank you Seoul for always providing the upmost quality and service and always making my family feel so welcome here!! We are customers for life!!!\n",

      "I thought the food here was decent. We ordered the spicy rice cakes and a few meat dishes. You could definitely find better, but that doesn't make the food here bad. What can be really terrible here is service. We were here twice (though to two different chains), the first time a Korean friend ordered in Korean and the second time we had to do without a native speaker. The second time was at this spot. Water was never refilled and it took over 30 minutes to catch someone's attention so we could pay. I will say that our order came quickly though.\r\n",

      "==========\n",
      "I've had my fair share of Korean food and I found this place a little disappointing. I ordered a Yukejang and it had the toughest meat I've ever had in korean cooking. The portion was generous and the soup was ok but the meat was so terrible I didn't even want to eat it. I also tried the chicken ramen noodle which was so much better and the protein was good in that dish. The banchans are plentiful and the waitresses are nice but not sure I would come back because yukejang is such a staple that they didn't do quite right...\n",
      "==========\n",

      "Our service was kind of weird at the beginning, not giving us a bigger soup ladle, no water, etc, but then at some point it got better and we got offered more kimchi than the first two dishes we were given. However, the beans were kind of hard (a bit undercooked) and the bamboo shoots had the same problem. The flavour was good though. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'm not sure what the dish we ordered is called- I wasn't around to order. It's a huge pot of seafood and we got two noodle sides, which my parents had. I did have a few pieces of noodle though, which were nice with the broth and chewy. The broth itself is really nice and pretty spicy. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The seafood was kind overcooked and were exactly fresh, but not terrible. All of it tasted quite powdery and tough to me so I generally avoided it, as I value texture over flavour. I generally stuck to eating the vegetables in the pot (mostly onions) which were fine but salty as I ate on. My mom did quite enjoy eating all the crab and lobster though, so I'm glad she had a good time. \r\n",

I believe that i won't be returning only because the day I ordered the buckwheat noodle, I advised the server that I did not like the noodles and she stated that i was the only one to say that I didn't like it and that everybody enjoys it.

Service was terrible and after we confronted them about the meat and how little it was 3 people, they told us that we should have gone some where else for all you can eat KBBQ and just stopped coming to our table. I love KBBQ but I'm never coming here again. I thought it was us but I have never had such a terrible experience. I've worked with customers and I would never in a million years tell people that they should have gone some where else. For $20 a person, you can go to tofu hut and get AYCE KBBQ. Which would have been $60 but no, we paid $80 to get half hungry stomach. I would definitely recommend you to go somewhere else because this place is terrible with service and food.\n",

It's great for people watching, as there were many different types there - pink-haired punks, people who didn't speak much English, older folks, (lots of) bros, families, couples on date night, etc. The chairs look like they're very old school chairs from a school, just painted black. They're not comfy for long periods of time. \r\n",

      "The restaurant is easy to find if you know where Fascinations is in Tempe. It's in the strip mall in the adjacent parking lot. The parking lot is terrible, so beware of where you park, so you may get parked in or have damage done to your car. And park no where near light poles - they are in the tiny parking spot, which causes a ripple effect of sh*tty parking jobs in the rest of the row. Walking a little further is worth not getting your car damaged and the chicken you get at Bonchon is definitely worth extra steps.\n",

I don't recommend anyone to eat at this restaurant. I would like to give below one star for everything, Soup noodle is way too salty, no sauce for egg rolls, we never received entree, each time I asked waitress, she keeps telling us coming coming with attitude. After an hour and half we could not wait so we decided to leave. I went to the counter to cancel remainder of our order and paid for what we had and we left.  The placed is dirty, food is terrible, and as for service, that was the worst service we have ever had.  Don't go there!\n",

We got the large beef combo for $90. It wasn't even enough to feed two let alone the 3-4 that was advertised. Overall value for price paid was not worth it at all. Also the service was terrible, how many times do you have to ask for items from the waiters. Is it worth the hype? Probably not.\n",

It was not during busy hours so I took that into consideration. The first waiter we got was rude she was head wait and she seemed to ignore everyone who was not of her ethnicity? The second time we went with family and the meat was burnt again.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "You guys know I love me some good Korean BBQ, but Hobak was such a let down. I have absolutely no desire to return here. Two stars instead of one because the meat quality is very good- but there is a lot more that goes into a restaurant experience to make it worth while. I was in a party of three and we ordered the Hobak Beef Combo. They served us the combo for two people. Why? I'll never know. Was one of us invisible? Anyway- the portions were tiny and I thought that was okay because I wasn't super hungry at the time anyway- but after we had eaten all the meat they brought out I though there is no way that can be it. I felt like I had barely eaten anything and I was embarrassed for the guests that had joined me (I chose the place to eat) because I know that they were still very hungry. So we ended up ordering another order of the marinated skirt steak and it took over 20 minutes for them to bring it out. TWENTY MINUTES PEOPLE! This is not the way Korean BBQ is supposed to work. The service was terrible. They give you very little banchan (just kimchi and radish) and none of the dipping sauces I usually enjoy with KBBQ (Doenjang, the salt with sesame oil over it, etc.) There was no lettuce or lettuce salad (except for one with ranch dressing and one with green onions and bean sprouts- but I like lettuce with Korean dressing with my KBBQ), rice paper, or radish to wrap your meat in. There was some marinated radish that was good but it was more like banchan than something to eat with your meat. They split one of the rice pop ice cream sandwiches between the three of us. Thanks. When the check came all I could think about was this was SOOOOOO NOT WORTH IT. I felt so bad for my guests and had I known it was going to be like THAT I never would have come here in the first place.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I've been to Hobak many times before and have not been compelled to write a review (good or bad) until now. No doubt this place has consistently tender meats and the sides have been decent in the past. However, last night was terrible. The sides were not interesting and for some reason all the meats cooked tasted like propane. Even the steamed egg tasted terrible like it was steamed in a vat of liquid propane. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the addition of many other quality kbbq restaurants in town, Hobak should have a place at the top of the pile because they, at least, cook the food for you but when the taste of the food was as bad as last night, you'd wonder if their days are numbered.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "3 stars is a generous rating... Came here because of the extremely high rating on Yelp. Disappointed is an understatement. Service was terrible. They kept forgetting items that we asked for and overall service was sporadic at best. We used the little service button on the table but it was mostly just ignored. They were trying to cook our meat for us but they were not around very frequently and we had to wait a long time in between the different meats\r\n",
      "AND the portions were small. We waited over half an hour just to get our checks and by that time the place was more than half empty. I've had much better Korean BBQ for a lot cheaper with better service.\n",

      "Today was my second time here and compared to the first, I would give it zero stars if I could. The food was decent, meat was okay quality, but for only 3 types of meat (we ordered the beef combo), that was supposedly meant to feed 3-4, one person could finish it by them self. Oh and I can't forget, all for $90. They forgot to give us our cheddar cheese dip that was part of the combo and we had to ask numerous times for side dishes that we eventually did not get. \r\n",
      "We mentioned multiple times and they still did not apologize or sounded like they cared either. \r\n",

The waitress left in the middle of our meal, never to be seen again. We had to fetch multiple others to get some service: more water, bill, to go boxes, dessert. And the expensive meat our waitress was in the process of cooking - burnt. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the hostess proposed to charge an 18% gratuity because we're a table of 6. Proceeded to say then that since one of us was a baby, they would waive this rule. When I didn't leave a tip - she asked if I wanted to tip the server, I responded that we didn't get any service, so no. She then reminded me that she didn't charge us 18% gratuity! All of this is after my parents - whom I was treating - walked out.  So I had this conversation while I'm waiting at the register as the hostess ran out of printing paper and didn't know how to replace it with the new roll for a while. \r\n",

      "They were good when they first opened. I believe the honeymoon period is over. Prices gone up about 25% and the quality was bad. We had food poisoning afterwards. When they cook raw meat that touched cooked meat it can't be good. Quality of meat is terrible now. A lot of fats that I have to throw away. It is so bland also. It is either no taste or very salty from the marinate. Side dishes are very limited now compared to before. It is also not fresh. Bubbles in the cold soup that lasted the whole duration of the meal, looked like dish wash water that I don't even touch. Overall terrible experience that I felt totally ripped off. I will not return again. They need to remain competitive with quality and value but now it is gone.\n",

      "Ggotsal - Very very good! Definitely my favorite from what we ordered, but I prefer my meats unmarinated. We asked for raw garlic and sesame oil, and they were quick to get this for us. The sesame oil comes in a little foil cup if you want to drop some garlic in there and put it on the grill\r\n",
      "Galbi - I usually don't prefer marinated meats, but I can't deny the tenderness of this meat. I also appreciated that there wasn't too much sauce and it wasn't salty.\r\n",
      "Service - our server (whose name I forgot, who's from Hawaii) was very attentive and friendly. She was always there and was good about asking how we like our meat cooked (they cook all the meat for you). I also appreciated that they frequently changed the grill without us having to ask. \r\n",
      "Dessert - Our combo came with the green tea ice cream dessert. It's green tea ice cream with red bean and bbungtwigi on each side, reminiscent of a green tea boonguhbbang ice cream. My family loved it, and my brother said it was his favorite thing we ate!\r\n",
      "Ambience - I love the interior decorations. It flooded my parents with nostalgia, and they were constantly smiling and commenting on all the posters and signs. \r\n",

      "Bad\r\n",

I was already next in line and I figured give his place a try. The soup's spinach was fresh which was the only saving grace.

She also mentioned that she couldn't fry the rice at the end, because again, they were short on staff members, and it would just back up the service even more. Understandable but what a bummer, because I was looking forward to the fried rice. \r\n",

They took forever to even take our drink order and it took even longer for the drinks to arrive. Our server just ignored us the whole time. Each time I wanted to order something I basically had to go out of my way to flag down the server which at first didn't bother me because she might have just been overwhelmed but I realized she was going to all the other tables and ignoring us.

I asked them why they charged for 10 rather than 9 since my wife didn't even had a bite to eat, their initial response was unfortunately you told us 10 adults and 1 baby they have to charge. I asked but she didn't even eat anything or even touch her plate, she used the restroom to tend to my son and left to the car right away.

Mainly just meats and the sides tend to be rice. The food is good if you can cook it right.

They all approached us and created a scene to explain the policy. Uhh...we would've paid the extra $20 to have the additional party join us, but don't just assume he showed up eat there!  And after all that scene, the assistant manager was about to make the exception after I kept arguing with him. Sad to say, we won't be going back there again.

However, after an hour, as we were slowly rotting away in the shadows, one of us sought an update and was informed that we had to wait yet another hour... and this was all while at least 5 tables around us were completely empty. Apparently, there's a policy that people who had put their names down before us would receive texts that their tables are ready and are given a 15-minute grace period to show up, but this is hardly effective if no one monitors that time limit and keeps open tables empty for 30 - 40 minutes while other parties are available in person to be seated immediately. Ultimately, we ended up waiting around 3 hours to be seated because we kept falling for the incremental increases to our wait and the false understanding that the food would be worth the lost time. I found a list of things that one can do with an extra hour due to daylight savings: http://www.inc.com/kevin-daum/24-things-you-can-do-with-an-extra-hour.html -- imagine doing all of those things THREE TIMES.\r\n",

Didn't explain the 4 random dishes sitting on the table already, how it works, etc. Whatever. I asked for soy for my hubby, and she looked at me like I was insane. SOY? WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY??? What Kind of establishment do you think we run here? You have some, well you have a sauce, that isn't soy, it's slightly sweeter, but there ya go. Fortunately, we were taken over by a new server after our initial order. We did manage to get some soy too. \r\n",

Second note, if you get the marinated shrimp, ask them if there is a technique to get the shells and heads off without totally getting it everywhere. I had no such luck and had so much gunk all over my hands trying to get it apart. UGH. There was no flavor to anything. It just had no redeeming quality, aside from our second server, the bussers, and cooktop swapper were all incredible friendly and nice. We tried almost everything, and I can't say I would try any of it again. 2 stars just because it is all you can eat (again, read the clause on the menu....and note they have cameras on the facility...in case you were thinking of slipping some chewing calamari or cow tongue in your purse to avoid being charged extra for it) , service was nice, and the process is fun. \r\n",

We told Marisol, the hostess at the time, that we had a group of nine. She said the wait would be approximately 45 minutes to an hour - this was fine since we were finishing up at WOB. She asked us whether we would like a high top with two grills, or the tables which came with three grills. We opted for three, set the reservation, and waited for the opening next door. After about 50 minutes, we still didn't get a text with an update on our table so the group just walked over to Gen... apparently there was a 'mistake' and we had to wait maybe 10-15 minutes longer...fine. After the next wait, two of us asked Marisol what the deal was... and apparently now we would be getting a table with only two grills.

They also had a big screen and they were showing college football. We came here right when they opened at 11 a.m. on a Sunday.

      "Food was alright. Service was terrible. We had a table of 9 people and we asked to split the bill. They said no and asked us to put it onto 3 bills. Almost all of us had cash, so they reluctantly split it individually for us. I'm pretty sure they don't split it because they don't want to pay the charges for renting the card machines. \r\n",
      "My friend paid for a $13 bill with a $20 and I paid with a larger bill. The server only came back with my change and expected my friend to pay $7 in tip. When they asked for change back from the server, she only came back with a $5 bill and forced him to tip the rest. \r\n",
      "One of the only people who paid with card was told after he paid that the server forgot to add a 50 cent charge for using the machine onto his bill. When he said to take it out of the tip which was well over 15%, the server refused and told him to pay the 50 cents. I won't be coming back here again because the service is ridiculously terrible.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Food was good but the service was really bad, did not feel welcomed when I walked through the door and after the food came, no one asked how I'm doing. When I asked for the bill I rang the bell 2 times and no one showed up. I waited 10 mins before I rang a second time and no one came until the third ring. When the server came it wasn't even the same server serving me this whole time and was apparently our actual server and when I paid he started to give me a really hard time about the tip I gave him which was a little less then 10% but I feel that he shouldn't deserve 10% because he didn't bring our food or even show his face to our table. I would've paid 10% or more if it was the other server. Wouldn't recommend dining here terrible service you can find somewhere else with same quality food and better service.\n",

It is usually packed on friday and saturday dinner time but the wait is never too terrible.

Overall, satisfied every time and the convenient location is a bonus.\n",

When we asked to return the dish they would not refund or let us choose something else. We waited for 20 minutes after we got our main course to get water. It is also expensive for the quality of the food. This is not the first time I've had Korean cuisine. Beef Bulgogi prepared without fried onions?? I've had cheaper and much better quality Korean food in the past. If you're looking for good honest rustic korean cuisine, do yourself a favour and steer clear of this restaurant please.\n",

When the waiter would change our grill, they transfer whatever we are cooking onto the new grill. Each time they did this, they didn't care that our meat would literally splatter all over the table. Such a waste of food and they didn't even bother cleaning it up. Absolutely unacceptable that this happened 3 times on the same visit.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The only downside was the service. Since you get to order 3 items at a time, after our first initial order it was pretty difficult to catch the attention of one the servers to place our next 3 items. This continued for the rest of our lunch whether it may be requesting more side dishes and water. It wasn't terribly busy so I'm not sure if the place was just short staffed at the time when I came in. Other than that, I think the price point and the quality of food that you are getting is pretty worth it! I will definitely come back again!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Yet again we had terrible service. I feel this time it was due to some slight racism. The server was female, she took and brought our first order. After that it's like she was completely ignoring us. He table behind and across from us were getting great service and she stopped by there tables several times.  She even passed by and looked straight at me several times. Every time I pressed the call button, it was always someone else who came by. Someone finally saw we weren't being tended to and they became our new server. We were at the resuraunt about 45 min longer then we planned. This is all because we were straight up ignored for that amount of time.  I'm giving it a higher score this time because our replacement server was excellent.  He had a beard with reddish hair.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This place has such terrible service! Our waitress was so rude. First she took our order but cut us off and walked away. She also kept repeatly ignoring our table and walking away when we were trying to order more. Not only that when she she was setting food for our table, she dumped all three of the plates of bulgogi on the grill. I don't mind that she tried to be nice by putting our food on there, but it didn't allow any other meat to be on the grill. We had intestines and pork belly and those usually cook longer. Also because she dumped all of it in, it left some juices and when we put our other meat in it tasted like bulgogi. Our waitress also kept dismissing us when we politely called her over. However despite the bad service the food was absolutely delicious. The meat were so tender and soft, it just melted in my mouth. Their green tea was also spectacular!  I love how everything tasted I just wish the service was a little better. I might come back just for the food! Overall the service is lacking but the food is super yummy and I would come again.\n",

      "Ehhhhh I was not terribly impressed with manna.... The good includes their prices are lower than some other Korean BBQ places in the area and some of the meats were very tasty. The bad was mostly service related. My friend had never had Korean BBQ before and therefore tried some meats she didn't like. I didn't like those either, so they went uneaten. The restaurant wanted to charge us for any excess meat we didn't consume..... I feel like this goes against the point of an all you can eat restaurant, which, to me, is to be able to try new things without the risk of cost. I also feel that the portions of meat they brought out were huge, and, if they wanted to reduce waste, they should offer smaller tasting portions. Anyway, it wasn't terrible if you know what you're getting into, but it was a bit of a frustrating experience for us.\n",

I never understood why these people choose to work with customers if they hate people. The restaurant was pretty empty when we came in here, but yet the employees were so impatient and really wanted us to order asap. The menu was only available in Chinese and there were just a few words I wasn't sure of so we had to ask the waitress to explain the menu to us but she was so reluctant to do so. Then we tried to get another employee and we realized that nobody here spoke English. I don't have a problem with people not knowing how to speak English but if you're opening a restaurant in Canada, can you at least have an English menu? Overall, they were just so irritated and it made us feel very uncomfortable. \r\n",

      "Anyways... We ordered the 5DM Chicken ($40) in the original flavour which was like a honey garlic or something like that. The fries were COLD and the chicken was slightly cooler than room temperature.. even with the tiny candles under the platter. The cheese didn't taste like normal cheese you would get at korean bbq places. It had a weird consistency and tasted like.. plastic?? and it just didn't melt. The chicken pieces were very tiny - like an adult had to cut up food so it's bite-sized for toddlers. The entire time I was eating, I had a gut-feeling I was going to get sick.\n",

      "Been here three times and every time was a terrible experience. First two times were not peak hours when we went, stood by the door for a good 5 minutes before someone acknowledged us and waved us to go sit. Sat down for 10 mins with no menu/utensils, etc. Had to call a waiter over to get the menus and order. We wanted to give it another try but this third time was the worst. It was during busy times so we had to wait by the door (again) for 5 minutes before someone noticed us (again). One of the waiters looked back at us, made eye contact, did not greet, then walked away. The second waiter finally noticed and asked us to go sit at a table at the far end. We sat down and waited 15 mins. Other people had come in and were greeted and seated, menus brought to them and everything. But nothing for us. We were there COMPLETELY ignored for the whole time being. So we got up and left. Beware, service is TERRIBLE at this place and especially some of the waiters will IGNORE you ON PURPOSE. Very rude. Try to avoid this place if you can.\n",

      "However, the service is pretty bad. This is the closest Korean restaurant to me which is why I come here regularly but the service kills me. Every. Time. They never seem to feel the need to clear vacated tables despite the huge line at the door. I've literally stood beside an empty table for 10 minutes while there are several servers around who could be clearing the table. Also, it's not uncommon to wait for service... Whether it be for menus, to place your order or to ask for more water. Lastly, they don't give you the side dishes until your dish is ready... But with their service standards, that could be a while.\r\n",

We ordered two orders of the Chicken with rice cakes ramen and cheese. We were amazed .. at the portion, it was a lot more than what Joons would usually give. The flavour was not the same the sauce was sweeter than spicy and the chicken wasn't as fresh as Joons would usually provide. Without comparison, this place wouldve gotten a better review but if you are going to open up in the exact same spot serving the one thing people would go there for, there is going to be a comparison.\r\n",

Unagi definitely the favourite with creamy avocado balancing the umami of unagi. Fries in kimchi fries were hot and crisp, and just thick enough to stand up to kimchi and cheese topping. A well done dish. Spoon pizza is tasty but you really can't go wrong with mashed potato, tomato sauce and a whole lot of melted cheese - not the best value given the small portion size, inexpensive ingredients and big price tag. Black squid was marinated in black bean sauce and grilled tender but also overpriced. Server was rude and unfriendly. Made us feel like we were a nuisance throughout the entire meal, when our only special request made at the end of the meal was to have the bill split. She didn't even acknowledge my thanks as I left the resto. Food poisoning set in at end of the night. Won't be going back.\n",

We had to flag down a server because ours never came to check on us and after an hour of waiting for our food and watching all the people around us (who arrived after us) finish their food, we thought it was odd we were still waiting. Our waitress finally came after we asked another server to go get her and then she said the order never went in and retook our order. We then waited another 20 minutes before it came out. Meanwhile, we had to flag down people to ask for water refills. I'm not one to ever complain (it makes me super uncomfortable), but this service was beyond unacceptable. We weren't rude about the mishap but our server continued to avoid our table the rest of the night and it wasn't until we asked to speak to a manager after our bill came that she even offered to do anything to make up for the terrible experience.\n",

      "We were beyond excited to try this restaurant as Graze and L'Etoile are two of our favorites.  We were seated immediately in a nice corner booth and were given a high chair for my nephew who I unexpectedly was watching that night.  Rather than cancel our dinner plans to go to Sujeo with my best girlfriend I decided to bring my sweet 16 month old nephew along.  Now, granted this is not a kid friendly place, but I didn't expect it to be a kid unfriendly place either.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service was poor to say the least.  After being seated we were not greeted by our server or brought menus for at least ten minutes.  Throughout the meal  our server rarely checked in and we had to flag people down repeatedly for basic things like silverware.  And the staff when delivering our food kept putting all of the piping hot dishes, blazing hot tea kettles, plates, etc etc right within arm's reach of the baby.  We had an entire booth with a huge table in front of it (one of those u shaped booths) and the baby was way off to the side.  I had to ask three separate servers not to put the dishes in front of him.  Common sense was lacking at Sujeo tonight.  \r\n",

The kohlrabi salad was pleasant enough but nothing beyond a B rating.  The Ddeokboki bordered on unpleasant with it's rubbery texture.  This dish was not pleasing to either of our palates.  The Pork and Shrimp potstickers were also unremarkable filled with dense lumps of meat.  The mango curry seemed like anything that we could have gotten at the food court at the mall.  The rice served with it seemed undercooked and hard.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A C- night out unfortunately.  I would have rated it 3 stars if the service hadn't been so terrible, but it's hard for me to overlook how dim witted the staff acted around a baby.

      "My mother and myself dined here for lunch. We split an order of the egg rolls. They were very different (very crunchy outside) They didn't really taste like an egg roll to me, but I did enjoy them.  I decided to try something unique off the menu - I couldn't decide between the Shio Ramen or the Khao Soi. The waiter highly recommended either. I decided to trying something different and new so I ordered the Shio Ramen. The waiter brought it out and the smell of it was repulsive. I tried to look past it and tried some of the broth. It was terrible. I didn't like it at all. I tried a few more bites and decided I couldn't even 'suck it up' and eat it - I knew I would be sick. I had my mother try it and she had the same reaction.  I had to send the meal back and tell the waiter I really did not care for it. They were able to make up the Khao Soi for me, which was MUCH tastier!  It was very spicy though.  I felt the menu needs to have some more details as to what is in the dishes and their spice level. When we were getting ready to leave there was another table that sent back the Kaho Soi because it was too spicy for them to eat.  The portions are very large, usually able to get a couple meals from a bowl of noodles. They are pricey - I'm not sure if I'd go back.\n",

      "Honest review: idk why theres so many bad reviews the food was really food this asian place was def better then the asian restaurants in Chicago (plz fix so you can order dinner items at lunch time and at dinner time order lunch items) ambiance cool and hip service: it was terrible honestly. Liked we walked in and like werent acknowledged for like a good five minutes we had to like go in front over her and wave her down like hey we would like to sit down (and mind u there was only one table filled) then like she was very slow didn't describe things didn't give enough napkins didn't change plates just was bad what was worst is that there were a lot of employees walking by idk why no one was helping like they were breaking things just really un professional. Wish tory miller would make a gourmet asian restaurant id go back to Wisconsin to try it hint hint. best things: kimchi burger/ dan dan noodles/ banh mi/ Korean Fried Chicken Sandwich\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kimcheese Juicy Lucy $14: I've had a lot of burgers in my life and this was orgasmic def was the best burger I ever had. The burger was moist and flavorful and their was a lot of cheese like it was just oozing out of the burger. The fried onion battered with flaming Cheetos was amazing The onions were amazing and the sauce was supper decadent just put more. I loved the pickles for acidity and the bun was toasted. My only complaint is the burger needs bacon every burger does. Then since it's name is kimichi burger wish it was spicier or had kimichi on it with the pickles. The chips on the side were amazing it added crunch and had honey so it added the sweetness which gave it complexity. And change lettuce for arugula  dont ever take this burger off the menu it's that fucking good\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dan dan noodles $13 were they traditional no, but they were the best dan dan noodles i ever had. The noodles were aldente and the sauce was phenomenal it was like sweet and spicy and there is a chili oil so that is traditional. The ground pork was tender and flavorful loved the addition of peanuts for crunch. No complaints (yes dan dan noodles are supposed to be oily its like a cross between Italian and chinese)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Banh Mi $9: best banh mi i ever had. The reason why this is the best because 1 good bread 2 theres actual pate in it. The pate had that wonderful liver funk that really gives this sandwhich depth. The bread was delish just plz toast it with some butter. The meats were really tasty but instead of ham wish it was like sweet bulgogi or some other type of sweet meat so the sandwich would have the whole sweet and salty thing going on. And if you could make the pork thicker it would be better. I loved that theirs mayonnaise every sandwhich needs mayonnaise. The pickles and cucumbers were amazing just put more because a banh mi needs a lot to cut through the richness buts its an amazing filling sandwhich\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Korean Fried Chicken Sandwich $9 this was fucking amazing. The chicken was supper crispy and tender and the sauce was the perfect combo of sweet and salty. The mayonnaise adds richness.  Loved the smoked gouda dont like that cheese but it worked my only complaint is use arugula or any other greens over lettuce\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pho $15: thought it was ok honestly the broth needed to be cooked down more and it was lacking the pho spices like you know when you can smell it across the room. However I loved the add ins because theirs bone marrow that adds richness. Then the meatballs are flavorful. It needs cilantro and more Thai basil\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cold Noodle Salad $10 I don't like cooled noodles so I can't comment on this but my favorite loved it saying its supper fresh\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I usually drive out to Chandler, Tempe or Phoenix to go out to eat but my husband and I decided to try somewhere a little more close to home. Mesa doesn't have a lot of cool, hip places to eat so our expectations were low. We were pleasantly surprised.  This Korean restaurant has a young, trendy vibe with it's black-walled interior and K-POP videos.  This place is perfect for date night or drinks with friends.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have to say though that the food is a little pricey and took a while to come out. I do love that they try not to be wasteful.  They don't fill up your water unless you ask and they don't serve you kimchi unless you want it. Kimchi is kind of like the Japanese equivalent of wasabi or ginger, something that is served on the side of most dishes but never gets eaten. I asked for the kimchi because I've never had it and wanted to try it. I took one bite and I was NOT a fan.  I kind of felt terrible for wasting it...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, my husband and I had a good time and enjoyed our food.  \r\n",

      "We tried this place for the first time tonight for dinner. We had heard great comments & saw how busy it was day after day for quite some time. We thought, let's give it a try! We were a party of 4 & arrived an hour after opening. We had walked in & the place was already fairly packed. We weren't approached to be seated right away ,instead were told we could sit in the middle area. Five minutes after sitting our waiter came over with 2 menus & we were told they didn't have enough menus for everyone. We all ordered cocktails & literally 10 minutes later they brought over the drinks. After we all took a sip it was another 10 minutes till our waiter came back to take half our order. Our appetizers slowly trickled out, one by one. We were brought 3 plates instead of 4 & were told all of the forks were dirty so none were available. The potstickers & mozzarella sticks had good flavor, but I didn't understand the ketchup dip for the mozzarella sticks. Weird combo.  We never were checked on while our food was cooking. Once the food came out it wasn't at all what we were expecting. Everything was fried & very little sauce if none on all the food. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All 4 of us were so very unhappy with our experience. We said to each other, we should have just walked over to Macayo's instead. Our final review is, terrible service, horrible food that leaves you feeling unhealthy & greasy, all ending with a $50 tab.  Needless to say, none of us will be returning. But now we have our own opinion everytime we pass by.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Worst place we've been to. Waitress got a attitude problem. Food was good though. Service is terrible. Seems as if we were not wanted there. 0 stars of I could. And there was no karaoke! Don't waste your time!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The service was okay. But the food...they served korean-style miso soup() that went bad. The tofu inside was moldy and overall it was just a terrible dish. The meat was tough.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "the second time i went was an absolutely awful experience - so bad that we left after ordering our food and realizing that customer service as horrendous as the first ten minutes were for the whole night would be entirely unacceptable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "first things first, i have to point out that i'm just a teenager. a baby-faced, 18-year-old teenager who often gets mistaken for 14, so i expect service to be less than stellar for the majority of places i go. however, this place set the bar at a new low.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "we (was with two friends - a group of 3) came into the place at 11:45 - maybe a bit late to expect good service, but i'll get around to that later. we were seated fairly quickly and handed menus. after a bit of deliberation, we signalled that we were ready order, once to get the server's attention, again to remind her that we were ready to order, and a third time to finally get her to break away from her EXTREMELY busy task of wiping down tables. all of this took about 10 minutes, mind you, and the place was almost empty - other than us, there was a single party of 2.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "so the server comes over, and asks us what we'd like to order, and while we confirm with each other really quickly that we'd like one of the combo meals, she turns to them, and seats them. this struck me as unusual, but i let it slide. but after she seated them, instead of letting the other server do it who was also unoccupied, she left our table to get them menus, barley tea, and drinks. and didn't come back to our table. at all. i had to flag down another waitress and tell her explicitly that we were ready to order.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "she took our order, and asked for our drink choices. i saw that they had tons of pitchers of barley tea sitting on a table near us, and asked for that. she had the audacity to tell me that they were out! the table next to us (that came in while we were ordering) were served a pitcher of barley tea WITHOUT even asking for it! at this point, i decided enough was enough. i cancelled our order and left. went to tofu hut. waited an hour, but the wait was way more worth it than the terrible nightmare that service was here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "and the first time? we got ayce kbbq. the servers cut us off (a party of 6) after 10 dishes and 45 minutes there - at a time where they weren't even especially busy. the food is decent, but the service is beyond terrible. i wouldn't recommend this place.\r\n",

      "I've been to this place twice.  The first time I was there, everything was great!  Perhaps my friend with whom I went had more experience with eating out, so we received great food and service.  Five Stars for that visit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The second time, I came for my birthday.  My fiancee and I didn't eat much, so we overpaid for the meal as it was quite expensive.  We basically tried one of everything that was on the menu.  Anyway, this time around, the service was terrible.  We basically had to wait for our food after one type of meat is out.  At the end, we asked for one order of fried rice.  There wasn't much, but we were charged for TWO orders.  Basically, they charged $3 per person.  There was definitely NOT enough fried rice for two people.  The good thing is that the fried rice could be taken to go.  One star for this visit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Average of my two visits:  5 stars + 1 star / 2 visits = 3 stars.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "After coming here a few times I've decided that I LOVE the a set combo with the brisket and pork belly. The only problems that I really have is that the service is SUPER SLOW like we ate here last night and we didn't get finished with our food until like 6-7 am when we got there at like 3-4. The lady was supposed to adjust our temp and flip our meat for us but most of our brisket burned and we had to try to eat it quickly before the other half burned. Oh to also add they don't give you rice , you Have to add it which I think sucks because who normally just eats Korean meat without the rice ?! And then we asked for hot tea and never got it . We ordered and got all our food before we even got our beverages! There were only 3-4 other tables eating too but she spent the least time tending to our table. Then last she never even brings out our bean paste soup that goes with the combo, we had to request it when it was time to pay the bill. We asked for the bill she didn't even give it to us for another 30 mins. We finally left when the sun was coming up and we come out to our car with a flat tire. Great. What a wonderful night. anyways 2 stars for the terrible service but also 2 stars because they're still reliable for night owls\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Ate here a long time ago one time, will never came back.\r\n",
      "Service was terrible unless you are Korean then you get served right away even though you came in after us.  Ayy goo racism?\n",
      "==========\n",
      "It's AYCE. Meat quality is...meh. It's not terrible, but look, it's AYCE. Can't really expect fine dining quality for the price you pay, either. I went with a big group of guys and overall the guys seemed to enjoy it more than the girls but then again, our group of guys were more carnivorous than the girls. If you're not a huge meat eater, the sides leave a lot to be desired. I feel a big part of the appeal of Korean restaurants is their banchan, or side dishes, but the choices are lacking in both variety and taste. The venue is also...meh. More like a casual grub joint. Service was friendly but rather understaffed and slow. Not a personal favorite. Probably not coming back on my own.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Korean person here and I will have to say our visit was terrible, we ordered nang myeun which was just ok, but our bulgogi was tough and not flame cooked like it should be, it kind of came out sukiyaki style which we didn't want. I should have said something when the lady covered up our cooking table, but some places will cook up the meat in the kitchen and present it all cooked and ready to go, not this time, it came out soupy. The banchan (side dishes) were old and sour! Now maybe they can get away with presenting old over ripe side dished to someone who doesn't know better, but what a poor example to give to someone that knows better. Maybe a off day, but I will never go back. Service was not that thoughtful, just drop and go. There was just my table and another one in the corner, and you could tell there were others there before us because you could see all the old BBQ tables sitting around with old food laying around with no one cleaning up the mess. Yeeeech! a bad example of Korean cooking.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Service -- TERRIBLE. Was promptly seated and greeted, got our side dishes, and ordered. But after that, it was like we barely existed. They forgot our orders not once but twice. After waiting maybe about 30-40 minutes (note this is the actual time... they just completely forgot our last order and I waited patiently because I thought it was just cooking still) for an item that never arrived, I asked for a check where I was over charged by $20. I asked for it to be corrected and they took it off but still never gave me my last order. I asked if I could take the last order off the bill because I had somewhere else to go at that point and no longer wanted to eat, but the manager said no and gave me the food in a to-go bag. Yay... I guess. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I also asked for tea for the entire table but received 1 cup of tea. Not even the jug they usually do... just a cup. LOL.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyway, after looking around, it seems to me that the servers are somewhat biased and prefer Korean patrons. I'm not sure if it was just our server but it seems that Honey Pig, through my friends who have come here on separate occasions, is notorious for terrible service.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Food -- GOOD! Great quality meat, great marination. I love the way they add the bean sprouts and kimchee on the pot and even the fried rice! Reminds me of how the food is done in actual Korea!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "AYCE -- should be called AAYCE... Almost all you can eat. It's $21 but items are limited... Like you could only order 1 of certain items. Which sucks because I could pay the same at Sura for actual ALL you can eat! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, food was delicious but the service and trickery of AYCE left me hungry and upset. Never coming back here again.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I've tried the fry in North York and it was so so, but I've been wanting to try this location out for a long time... And super glad I did. Got the half half original and the spicy sweet sauce. Ugh so good. Perfect for after drinks. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One star off because the seating situation is pretty terrible.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Average food, terrible service. Will not be back. It took us 10 minutes standing at the entrance to be seated. Waiters will walk by you even when you flag them down and when they do notice you, they nod but take decades before they serve you. We were seated after a long time, only to wait a million years before I got fed up with being ignored by waiters and went up to them because we wanted to order food. Waiter didn't even look apologetic when I did and took another 10 minutes to come get our orders after. While taking our order, he knocked over the entire container of soy sauce which lead to it spilling all over the table. I don't even know why he felt the need to move it in the first place. He didn't apologize for his mistake and he didn't even tell us to move to another table. Instead, he just left without a word to get a table cloth. We had to ask him ourselves if we could move to the table beside us. Keep in mind there were plenty of empty seats in the restaurant. It was not busy. \r\n",

      "Again, no apology, he just let us move. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We ordered a large portion of the tako HanPan. They must've left the pot on the stove and the food must have been precooked because a lot of the squid and veggies were burnt and the taste was either lukewarm or cold. You could taste the burned parts and the smell was overbearing. Over all not impressed with this place. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bill took forever to come. Again I had to go up to them to pay because no one would come and take it. And of course again no apology. The woman who took my change looked at me coldly and absentmindedly. \r\n",

      "==========\n",
      "I'm a terrible judge of places to eat.  My criteria is have good food I can afford; boxes were checked.  Servers were attentive and helpful to explain what happens; pro tip - order by number.  I'm a sucker for all things pork belly ... Made my selections easier!  Beef bulgogi, chicken bulgogi, spicy pork belly, marinated shrimp until hearts were content.  Shrimp was a little more manual than I would have liked, but fine.  Kimchee was on point.\r\n",

      "==========\n",
      "Such a disappointment. I was sooo excited this place finally opened. First, the food is just okay nothing special.  Second, our service was terrible !! They really need to train them better. Sorry but we won't be back\n",

      "This was my first time to an All-You-Can-Eat Korean BBQ place. I ate here with two friends that had been here once before. If it weren't for them, I would have no clue how to interpret the menu. No server came over to explain the menu or ask if we had been there before.  Basically, you pay one price ($20/person for regular menu) and you can order any of the items listed. They bring out the meat or veggies raw and you grill them yourself. You can order as much as you'd like, as long as you eat it all. They charge $5 per dish that you do not finish. I was not impressed by the meat, it was chewy, fatty and unseasoned/marinated.  About half way through, our grill was in dire need of being changed but we were unable to get the attention of anyone. We also needed to order more food and have our waters refilled. All the servers were standing around chatting.  Finally, after our grill was charred beyond belief, our server came by to check on us. By the end of our dining experience, I came to realize that $20/person is way too much for the quality of food and terrible service.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The food is good. But the service is terrible. We ordered the 3rd time, and waited more than 15mins but nothing came out. Then, we must checked out cuz my son fail asleep. The white guy waiter said he ordered the wrong table. It means the food brought to another table, but at least he has to come for asking but ... if he came often to ask us, I think nothing happened to us.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This service was terrible. After waiting 15 minutes to be seated after seeing 5 open tables we sat down with no attention at all. Waiting for 10 minutes with no service we asked a busser where the service was and then waiting another 5 minutes we decide to leave because we were getting ZERO attention and other workers didn't seem to care as well. This place is in a NEED of workers and the ones there now need to work a little harder.\n",

      "Terrible service, terrible food. Food looks nothing like the pictures on their menu. The rice was more of a porridge and their plates came dirty with left over food on them. When you complain, you don't even get an apology but just a what-can-u-do face and a shrug..\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We were excited to hear that this place has an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ and when we arrived, we were given a nice private booth that were away from the crowd. \r\n",
      "However, our service was extremely poor as it took us a very long time to get anything from the servers. There is apparently a button that's supposed to signal them for assistance, but it doesn't seem to be working. It took us 20-30 minutes to get any refills for side dishes and meat.\r\n",
      "I also noticed that the restaurant was severely understaffed for a Saturday evening and our booth made it hard for the servers to see us so these two reasons could've been the cause for the terrible service.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Although the menu is AYCE, the staff will 'forget' items every so often including lettuce wraps, rice or any of their other unlimited side dishes. The table didn't come with any soy sauce, and although we requested it multiple times, it never came. \r\n",

      "We decided to order package A (pork and beef) for $18.99 and were told that if anyone else at our table wanted to order another package, we wouldn't be able to switch back. \r\n",
      "The meat was totally fine and cooked quickly. Since many of us had been to at least one Korean BBQ place before, we all had some idea how to use the BBQ on the table. We had three going at the same time, and it was a glorious feast. However, one thing I did notice was that none of the meat was seasoned and some of it even seemed frozen. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My suggestion if you do decide to go here: come in a group, keep on top of the staff for the items you want and order lots of Soju. It will make the experience go by a lot quicker and make everything taste a lot better. If I'm being completely honest: I didn't have a terrible time and the food was totally fine. But the service was just mediocre at best, and I hated having to essentially harass the staff for basic items like rice, lettuce wraps, and kim chi. But if you don't mind, then get into it.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This is the only restaurant in Toronto that offers authentic Korean BBQ that is all you can eat for a reasonable price. $16.99 gets you pork belly and pork neck. $20.99 gets you the pork belly, pork neck, beef, and bulgogi. The quality of the meats really is fantastic and easily surpasses Korean Grill House and Chako. Giving you lettuce wraps to compliment the meats should truly be the only way to enjoying Korean BBQ. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And don't forget about the side dishes! They have radish, fish tofu, bean sprouts, kimchi and a spicy soup. All great!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So... what's wrong with this place? Mainly, its just how the place is operated. It's *really* slow. It takes forever to bring anything to your table. They put my party of 6 people to one grill, so the turnover for everyone to get food was almost as slow as their service. When you ask for a refill of anything, they ask for your plate back so they can actually refill the plate again. When we asked for extra soybean paste, they mixed up the individual plates and gave it back to the wrong individuals! That is ridiculous business practice and frankly a little gross. I didn't use the soybean paste after because I didn't want to be eating mystery saliva coming from someone else at my table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The reason I was hungry at the end of the night is because the restaurant enforced its two hour dinner policy. I've never had a restaurant actually enforce this rule when the guests were still hungry on a Thursday night without anyone waiting for a table. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The $20.99 menu on their door includes a FIFTH item. The servers never brought it, or even mentioned it, but the price increase is supposedly justified by this non-existent fifth meat item.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Dont get the Bulgogi. It comes in a separate grill so you have to wait for them to change it for you and THEN wait for it to heat up and cook the grill. This takes at LEAST 25 minutes of your 2 hour time limit. Not worth.\n",

      "Visited here recently for a late dinner all you can eat authentic Korean BBQ. Overall, an extremely disappointing experience with average food and terrible service.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Located by Christie on Bloor, Jangwon looks fairly standard for a Korean restaurant. We ordered the full all you can eat menu which was $20.99. This meant you would get access to 4 types of meat (pork belly, pork neck, bulgogi, and beef) soup, rice and side dishes. The food was average in my opinion but definitely much better than Chinese BBQ places like Korean grill house and Chako. This was authentic after all.

She, for sure seeing us completely ignored us. That was okay because we were able to wave down another younger male server who helped us with a table. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were seated in a booth (which contributed to the crappy service we got due to the lack of visibility). We probably waited 15 minutes with no one attending to us to take our orders. I actually sat looking out of the booth trying to wave someone over (had to do this throughout the night). I'm sure I was ignored multiple times. And when I say ignored, I mean the servers would look over to you, make eye contact and proceed to walk away and not come back. We ended up trying to wave down the one younger male server the whole night who actually acknowledged us. At one point we asked for additional lettuce, soup and meats and the female server actually asked us (while not paying attention/looking away from us) to pass her all the empty plates - when they were completely within her reach. I honestly thought that the service wasn't just crappy but down right disrespectful at one point during my night. \r\n",

Put the meat on, go outside and catch pokemon for 15 mins then come back and flip it and then take another pokemon go break. My crappy $10 frying pan at home would have cooked tastier pork belly than this. The server said it was supposed to take very long as well. Well if this is how its supposed to be.... I never wanna go back here...\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "888 Korean BBQ is a new non-AYCE Korean bbq place on spring mountain.  Their claim to fame is that they are the first Korean restaurant to serve Kurobuta however I believe Master Kim's Korean BBQ in the SW side of town served it before them.   If you don't know what Kurobuta is, it's also known as Berkshire pigs.  Kurobuta in Japanese literally means black pig. They are known for the tenderness and marbled meat.  888 offers 8 different flavors of pork belly as well as seafood offerings, chicken, and beef.  There are also vegetarian options available and other a la carte dishes you can order besides bbq like stews, soups, noodles, and bibimbap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ambiance looks very clean and the tables have two heating elements. One is for the soup and one is for the meat/grill.  I think it's the first in the Vegas valley to have this set up as I haven't seen it before locally.  The grill pan is also slanted so all the oil/grease drains down a hole in the table.  The wait staff cooks for you just like at Hobak but the plus side is at 888, the tables aren't so close to each other so you don't feel cramped.  The ventilation at 888 is pretty good, I didn't leave smelling like food.  I found this a positive as most Korean bbq restaurants leave your clothes smelling like your dinner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I dined here with a party of 3 and we ordered Combo A for 2 people which lets you try the 8 different pork belly flavors. We also ordered one fatty rib a la carte. It turned out to be around $58.  Combo A comes with 24 oz of pork belly. We were contemplating doing Combo B to get both the pork belly and short rib however it only comes with 12 oz of pork belly and 8 oz of short rib.  We decided to do combo A + short rib a la carte which came out the same price as combo B but you got double the pork belly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The combo comes with all the banchan (side dish), two appetizers, the meat, seafood soup, and fried rice.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The appetizers- They have 11 appetizers to choose from and our party went with the corn cheese and the steamed egg.  They were both tasty but I wouldn't say anything sets them a part from other Korean restaurants serving the same thing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soup- The seafood soup that is included is really good and contains all types of seafood including muscles, clams, octopus, big shrimp (with heads on) and crab.  Also a bunch of vegetables are in the soup. The soup does contain some spice but its not too spicy.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Banchan- All very good and many options. There was kimchi, bean sprouts, fish cake, mac salad, salad, shredded green onion, pickled onion/peppers, and maybe a few more that I can't remember at this time.  Free refills on all banchan- I say this as some Korean restaurants charge for each banchan dish (i.e. Best Friend).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The meat- Would highly recommend the fatty short rib. It was so tender and flavorful. Perfectly marinated.  The pork belly was really good too however I thought the short rib was the star of the night.  We tried all 8 flavors of pork belly: regular, red wine, garlic, green tea, sweet soy sauce, curry, gochujang, and miso.  My favorite out of the 8 were the sweet soy sauce and the miso. The regular/red wine/garlic/green tea's flavors were all subtle.  They give you 3 dipping sauces; ponzu, sweet, and spicy.  If you want the traditional sesame oil + salt, you will need to ask.   Overall trying all 8 flavors of pork was a good experience and now I know what to order the next time I come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fried rice- The fried rice comes post bbq, they cook it in your soup pot with all the left over kimchi, bean sprouts, and soup broth.  If you want rice during the beginning portion of the meal, it's $1 extra.  It cooks on the stove on the table and the rice gets crispy like dolsot bibimbap (bibimbap in the stone pot).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For checking into yelp, you get a free macaron ice cream sandwich.  We tried vanilla, green tea, and coffee.  Would recommend getting vanilla as I think it tasted the best. The other two weren't terrible however. They did taste a bit artificial.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Conclusion: Highly recommend this place as the food was great, the wait staff was attentive and caring, the restaurant was clean and spacious, and they cook the meat for you so you don't have to guess when it's done.  Would also for sure suggest ordering the fatty rib as that was the stand out dish from last night.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "HOWEVER, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE SERVICE TODAY but they were NOT  what my friend and sister said they were. We sat right next to the kitchen, where we were able to see the staff and our food come in and out. Oddly enough, once our table was getting filled with empty plates and there wasn't any food left to cook, THE STAFF refused to tend to us. EVEN OUR WAITER?!?! We looked at them so confused. There was a point in our meal where this lady, strongly placed our food onto the table, didn't even make eye contact or tell us what she was giving us. Terrible...  terrible..... The food didn't even taste as good as I wanted it to be only because they the service just ultimately failed us. \r\n",

      "I feel BAD for even giving 1 star to this restaurant. We dined here tonight for a group of 6 and our experience was really unpleasant. First of all, the price here compared to the quality of the food is SKY HIGH. For the money we spent at this restaurant we could have fined nicely at a restaurant on the Strip. The quality of the meat is okay but the food here is really under or over seasoned. I don't think the employees here have had much training here either because our waiter was spilling food and sauce everywhere. The meat portions were all very small considering we had ordered a portion for 4 (we ordered other main dishes as well) and they were all very salty even for marinated meat. As a Korean who worships KBBQ I was pretty disappointed. The cold buckwheat noodles were also terrible. On the menu, it was displayed very nicely but it was all a scam. The noodles were from a package, and they weren't even boiled properly. In the end we just sent them back. We had a pretty bad experience and we don't plan on coming back. I'd much rather go to 8 Ounce or Hobak for bbq.\n",

There is a normal wait for the food to be cooked, so if you're used to microwaved stuff you may get antsy, but it's quick in relative terms. The servers are very nice, down to earth people, and my waitress Jamie always made sure my glass was full and I had everything I needed. \r\n",

Clearly Matt knows how to raise children as well as he cooks, and the overall experience at Served shows his dedication to making a great dining experience.

The customer service was terrible. One of the girls at our table was not even asked once what she wanted to eat and one of the servers got visibly upset about one of the tickets and crumpled it up at our table. A few of my friends were super pumped about the all-you-can eat sushi. I heard that the rolls had way too much rice and too little fish. Lastly, one of my friends said he got food poisoning. \r\n",

The HI roll was good tho dry. The makeral, yellowtail, albacore, tuna, and the other fish like red something I can't remember were dry. The ugani was amazing and the salmon was terrible. Overall average I guess. Might be good. For AZ but honestly not that amazing.\n",

Upon coming into a completely empty restaurant, I asked if they were closed, even though the hours said 10pm on yelp. The gentleman said they closed at 9:30... didn't seem right. I ordered the spicy pork dish, the Vegas roll and shrimp tempura roll. The Vegas roll had little to no eel, and barely any avocado or cream cheese. The rice tasted like old, re-cooked rice, would definitely not recommend the sushi here AT ALL, you are probably better off chewing cardboard. The pork was ok, not terrible. I enjoyed the side dishes of pickled cucumber and radish than I did the actual food... Our server was rude and although he did refill our drinks at the very end, during the entire course of the meal he sat at a table on his phone while the other female server seemed to do all the work. Clean the tables, give us our side dishes, etc. This review gets 2 stars instead of 1 because she was friendly and nice. I will however not ever return here, for good Korean go to Hodori or Cho dang\n",

I like the stuff, but it was strange that I had to put in my rice. The hot sauce was left with me to decide how much I wanted to put in...it wasn't very strong so I had to pour in a lot. My friend complained that the seafood wasn't fresh and that there were some alright pieces and some not-so-good tasting pieces. However, it was just the right amount of spice. It took a while for the server to return with his rice, since the dish came with a bowl, but he was waiting at least 3 minutes (when usually rice is made in bulk, so it shouldn't take that long...)\r\n",

Also, waitresses were doing things in the back, probably organizing cups and plates or whatever, so loudly that it was almost unbearable.  Some people were looking around trying to figure out what was going on (then realized it was just waitresses working).  The whole experience was terrible.  They got two stars for the food.

Less than 5 seconds after he handed us menus he asked us if we were ready to order... we hadn't even opened our menus!! He told us that the kitchen was closing and needed to know our orders right now. He was very demanding was rude. We told him what we wanted and shortly after received the food. I would rate the food a 3.5/5 but the service was utterly terrible. As we began eating our food he ran up to us with the bill and said we had to pay right now. We both had food in our mouths and he would not walk away from us until one of us paid on the spot. My partner left his dinner, waited in line to pay and then sat back down to his then lukewarm food. Furthermore, the servers don't care about refilling your tea or sides or asking how the meal was... all they cared about was ushering you out before the restaurant actually closed. I have worked in the restaurant industry before and know better than to rush customers out the door. Will never return.\n",

Our 2 drinks were maybe refilled once (I was very dehydrated when I left). Our appetizer of pot stickers arrived after our entrees were served and was ice cold. The steak tasted like what I would imagine a steak would tasted like if Slim Jim sold steaks. The Alfredo that the misses got had the blandness of licking a rock. I've had better top Ramen. The price was cheap, but so are the hot dogs at Circle K and they have more flavor. This place was so terrible that I don't even like Elephants anymore. Yes, I am booking a trip to Africa to harvest illegal ivory tusks so I can take them back to the restaurant and shove them up the chefs ass.\n",

While he was trying to vomit, I notified the manager and got his contact info.  After the whole ordeal, and our trip to the ER, the manager said that the 'new guy' in the kitchen told him that they were out of macadamia nuts that night, so he just used peanuts instead.  :|\r\n",

It started out with promise as the zesty artichoke dip was actually really good and the chips were not overly salty like a lot of other places.  I ordered the blackened mahi mahi with mango salsa.  The mahi was slightly over cooked, not enough to make it inedible but enough to notice and the mango salsa was terrible but the mango butter made up for the salsa.  My husband got the Cajun chicken and it tasted like unseasoned microwaved meat.  It was really thin chicken breasts and the creamed spinach it came with was terrible.   We won't be going back.\n",

This is not that same one. Very Corporate Disneyfied jungle themed restaurant now. I am guessing since it is a chain it is not related to the original.

They have consistently been less then friendly, messed up my orders, gave my take out order to someone else and even ran out of the food I ordered but waited for me to come pick it up to tell me and then proceeded to act like I was ridiculous for being upset and wanting a full refund.

From the name of the place, Spoon House, I was hoping to sit in front of a hot bowl of traditional Korean soup on a nice cold night but the name was a little deceiving. The place was very bright and well-lit. The menu was lit on flat screen TVs which was a pretty cool feature in the restaurant. \r\n",

      "The menu consist of Korean-style tacos/burritos, Spoon House trays (Korean-style meat entree), and rice and noodle dishes, however, the menu was limited and a little random? One of the random dish was a ramen and kimbap combo (korean-style sushi)  which seems like a genius idea since this place is located on a college campus. I mean, what college kid wouldn't like that? \r\n",

      "My boyfriend and I (yes, I mention him every time I yelp... we like to eat a lot) shared a 3 taco combo special which include a fountain drink for $6.95 and Bulgogi tray. We also got an extra taco (each taco cost $2.00) to divide the food equally. \r\n",

      "The tacos were nothing special. If you get the 3 taco combo special, it's nice that you can mix your pick of types of taco meat (bulgogi beef, bulgogi chicken, sweet and spicy chicken, or spicy pork). In my opinion I thought the tacos were eh okay. On a good note, the tacos felt light. I didn't feel like I want to roll home like I do when I eat Chipotle's burrito. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Bulgogi tray was pretty disappointing... maybe because of my Korean background, and growing up with awesome Korean mom/cook, I judge Korean meals critically. The bulgogi tray came with rice, side salad, 2 puny potstickers, an eggroll, and sweet potato fries. Suggestion... if you claim you're a Korean restaurant, why wouldn't you add kimchi in the tray? Kimchi is ubiquitous dish for Koreans. It's kinda of an insult to not have Kimchi at a Korean restaurant. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, the experience (food, service, atmosphere) wasn't terrible but  it was mediocre. It seems like Spoon House has catered their menu towards Western's taste.

I wish their business good luck.\n",

      "==========\n",
      "The food is the quality I expected for the price. Not terrible, it had flavour but it was almost too greasy. In comparison between other Korean BBQ places, I prefer Seoul and here's why:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1) The service. We ordered all you can eat at Insadong, for 22.99. The first order rolled in quickly even though we asked for it cooked in the kitchen, it was accurate and came with the sides. However, it's the second order that annoyed me and my family. No one came by to pick up our round 2 order, and though we ordered more sides after our server cleared our first round, they did not arrive until we specifically hauled down another server. I assume it had been forgotten. The second order arrrived in parts. And many mistakes were made. I'm not sure if this was a tactic for us to order less as we feel fuller after longer periods of time passes. In the wait time between parts of round two which was about 30 minutes, no one had came to check on us or offer us water. Instead the employees on floor stuck to cleaning the restaurant quite heavily, and speaking amongst themselves. I couldn't understand the neglect as they were still two hours away from closing and it was not busy, actually we were the only ones dining at one point. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2) Quality. The sides were very average. The honey potatoes I've come to love from kbbq were soft, and runny. Never had that issue before. The meat itself, all came together stuck on one plate. Presentation was not appetizing, and flavours mixed and not for the best. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3) Not User Friendly. No descriptions on your all you can eat menu, and goodluck trying to haul down a server. The options for the amount of meat were inconsistent, some were ordering by strips and others by 100 grams. I don't really know what 100 grams amounts to but I guess you figure that out as you go. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Summary. So yes, you pay for what you get quality wise but the service we received that night was probably one of the most neglectful experiences I've had. The ambience isn't that appealing either. So I say, if you like the person you're going to eat with, spend a little extra and go to Seoul or even Gyu-kaku for Japanese BBQ.\n",

The price is pretty high. specifically for dinner.  The meat, on some days is amazing, and on others just ok.  the service is fine.  Nothing super special about it.  And the ventilation system is not very good.  The cooked food is meh worthy, but again its a kbbq place go for the raw meat to cook for yourself.  I was not a fan of their salad choices but you know with so many kbbq places around, this is just in the middle.  Not terrible, but not great.\n",

When I asked why the price is different, lady at the front desk said it was a holiday week. When I spoke with more senior waitress/manager and communicated to her that is was a false advertisement she just asked me to leave the place. I was going to leave, but my family wanted to stay. So we stayed and the end, when we got the check, the check included 18% tips included in our statement even though it was only three of us. The food was good, but service was terrible. I would recommend for them to change service management and start respecting their customers.\n",

I do not want to sound cheap but would just some dumpling service or discount could have made me feel better? I dont know as I didn't receive any damage control. I'm completely aware that asking for 'service' for no reason is not a good way of going but nothing was done to make us feel better except servers telling us the food will be out soon.\r\n",

Taste is is not bad but not like this is so amazing when their main dish is pork bone soup and $12 price point is definitely not cheap and shows that they're not in low pricing war then they need to compete in quality and service field I guess, but I didn't experience either of them in the food and wait time except nice servers. We also had difficulty seeing difference between regular and large.\r\n",
      "-not sure why but they somehow do not have napkins prepped on tables, but servers have plenty when you ask one. I can see that it was a business decision to probably keep the table space less occupied and save napkin cost but then what happens is you end up putting your metal chopsticks and spoons on the table during initial setup which was cleaned with a cloth prior. I personally feel napkins should be given out.\r\n",

There were a few pieces of zucchini and a few pieces of pork. It really should be advertised as an onion dish. Unfortunately, my boyfriend doesn't like onions.

Got seated as soon as we walked in.. alright, so far so good. Spent some time deliberating over what to order. When we had decided, they took FOREVER to come by and take our order, despite us ringing our call button every couple minutes. They only bring you your sides after you order, so those eventually arrived afterwards. The sides were the standard kinds you usually get at Korean places, about average quality. They give you disposable paper place mats to eat your meals on at this place, so while the four of us were waiting for our meals, we started using the back of one to play Pictionary. When a waitress arrived with two of the four entrees we ordered, she already had a disgruntled, sour look on her face. Either she was in a really bad mood or she hates her job. Maybe both. She just started arbitrarily all-but-flinging the plates on the table, mumbling the names and not even bothering to figure out who they belonged to. The two dishes she brought first were mine and the girl sitting across from me, us being seated furthest away from her. Of the two people sitting facing each other closest to her, one was missing her place mat (we were using it for Pictionary) and the other had it in his hands (he was drawing on it). The waitress paused and stared at what he was doing, then in the biggest display of passive aggressive attitude ever, yanks his own place mat from under his elbows and places it in front of the other girl who was missing hers. Okay. I would understand her behaviour if she was trying to serve my friend her meal and wanted to ensure there was something under the dish. But no. She didn't have anything else to serve us and just stormed off. The other two dishes didn't show up for another five (the guy's meal) and then ten (the girl with the missing place mat's meal) minutes. So.. what the heck was the point of all that? The food itself was horrible, too. Maybe I just ordered a bad dish.. I can't be sure. I ordered the dak kalbi jungsik (marinated and BBQ'd spicy chicken on hot plate with rice). The dish was mostly onions, with a few pieces of chicken that were mostly gristle, connective tissue and cartilage. Horrible. It wasn't even a decent sized portion for $12. When we finished our meals, it also took forever and a day to get our bill. I think the fact that we were sitting in a booth didn't help because they just seemed to forget about us, but the call button on the table should mitigate that fact.. Whatever. I'm not coming back here unless I get dragged and the meal's free. Waste of time and money in an area overflowing with better options. Don't bother.\n",

A young waitress would come to our table and tell us that she will be right back every time we asked something about the menu options.

The calamari was some of the worst we've ever had - tasted like it had been sitting in the refrigerator for weeks. The burrata appetizer had a funky taste to it.

We had chosen a booth which was big enough for at least 4 people, because the place was less than half full when we got there. Needless to say we felt bad for the people waiting. We were ready to go but had to wait, while people waiting to be seated looked confused and upset. I'm not saying anyone should rush to give up their seat, but we waited over 15 minutes for the check. Eventually my wife asked a different server for the check which arrived soon after, however, it sat on the table for at least another 5 minutes until I walked it over to their register and paid it.

Just to give it another shot, I went with a friend again and a person who has never tried Korean food.  Other than the ok galbi, both of us thought every other dish was insipid, overcooked, and just gross.  Maybe I've been blessed to actually have tried Korean food that taste good, and I know the difference, but I have no idea why people like this place.  It is terrible.   Terrible!\n",

Took 20m to get refill for water. We kept trying to get a server's attention to get us more water. The same male employee just looks at us and looks away.

When the tofu arrived, I asked if we get rice with the dishes and she said no. I stated we had them last time and she said not with this dish, okay that's fine, we ordered 2 bowls of rice. When the rest of the food came out(Korean pork belly with house salad), she didn't bring the side dishes like we had last time, I waved her down and asked if we get them. She said not with these dishes, okay I assumed the pork belly was a entree considering it was 13$ and on the front of the menu close to where the entrees were and it didn't distinguish above what it fell under. She said it would be extra for the side dishes and didn't explain for which ones or anything.

Due to our restricted lunch time we placed an order in advance to eat in the establishment. When we arrived the food was packed to go and we all paid for our meals. We explained that we were going to stay and eat and immediately received attitude. Let me say this...in our party there was a Hispanic male, white woman and two black women. The male in our party asked if we could have chips (which are complimentary for dine-in). The gentlemen (owner) behind the counter proceed to yell and state to the Hispanic male in our party that this was not Taco Bell and he couldn't have things his way....very racists. Then he proceeded to call him an asshole and walk up on him yelling in his face. Let's say it was really close to becoming physical. Thankfully there was a cop in the establishment who deescalated the situation. We will make sure to pass the word on in our business so they understand the type of people who own and work for this restaurant. Dont support this business. I work for an organization that is well over 4000 employees and I train new employees every year.

The quality of the cheese is of course better than average because when I pull a few fries out, the cheese actually streches out instead of snapping on instance.  The bulgogi meat in the fries were delicious, not hard as a rock like some places that make terrible carne asada.  Good thing I ordered a half because it was very huge.  The kimchi fried rice was a full size dish.  I have got to say, it was very different.  The flavor was light and not overpowering.  The meat, was of course the same as the fries.. GOOD.  \r\n",

We enjoyed a number of our old favourite small plates, all excellent; mini spicy salmon tacos, crispy tofu, pork/prawn potstickers, edamame, chicken lettuce wraps and seaweed wafers. I can't get enough of that hot mustard oil served with the wafers! We were a little disappointed in the amount of chicken that came with the lettuce wraps. It was a pretty small amount, supplemented by rice. I'd prefer more meat. But they were still delicious and came with a nice array of sauces. I had never had bibimbap before. And probably never will again. I didn't care for this dish at all. The presentation was nice but once mixed together is was just a bowl of mush. Probably enjoyable for some, but just not my thing.\r\n",

While Petite tried to muffle the sound a little with softer furnishings and padding, Anju has done none of that. Probably because it didn't really work. I don't know how you fix a problem like that but having to yell at your table-mates and serving staff for the entire evening is so very taxing. I realize that restaurants can get loud but plan to leave here with a hoarse voice. If you have hearing difficulties, you will struggle.\r\n",

      "Great food overall. They were out of the signature eggplant which I had really wanted to try so that was disappointing. They let us order it but then much later on in the night informed us they ran out so I'm guessing the way the waitress spaced our meal caused us to miss it which was a huge disappointment. Most dishes were great, others just ok. Waitress was very slow and probably had too many tables for her abilities but she was very nice and friendly. The room has terrible acoustics and it was hard to hear our friends across the table. A visually nice restaurant though. I'll try it again for sure.\n",

I continued arguing with her about her lies and she finally gave in and said she'd give us a free chicken. She went back to the kitchen to tell the man in the back and he came out and introduced himself as the owner. He said that he could not give me a free chicken and instead started yelling at me, lecturing me like I was his child or something. He said that I shouldn't walk into his restaurant and make a scene, when the only reason any of this happened was because of a mistake they made. He reluctantly gave me the chicken and then we left.

Overall, the food was just so so and not worth the extra $$$ that we paid to eat at what I would deem a premium restaurant.  Their customer service definitely needs to improve dramatically.  Save your money unless you really want bbq meat.\n",

At best it should have been no  more than $35.00.  they charged for everything $3.00 for a Pepsi, $4.00 for a coffee,$3.00 for each glass of OJ,$1,00 for 1 slice of tomato on a sandwich, and $3.00 for a side of Cole Slaw., $7.00 for a half order of mac and cheese  as a side item.  You did not get anything for a side with your sandwich.  Everything was ala cart. I have never been so taken advantage of in a restaurant before.  You might expect to pay those prices in Chicago.  But Tipsy get a life your not in the city...The Ambiance was cold and looked like a cafeteria.      If you want the experience help yourself not me again.........\n",

      "The gimbap  (Korean sushi) is good. Soondae was definitely microwaved, as the casing of the sausage was super hard and dry and just terrible, because it smelled like a freezer because of improper storage. I was reminded of all the episodes of Kitchen Nightmares and their microwaved food. The dumplings came boiled although it is supposed to be fried or steamed, according to the menu. We asked for steamed, and they were served submerged in the water they were boiled in.\r\n",

      "Also, our server was terribly rude although we were perfectly well-mannered, quiet customers that didn't even ask him any questions.

      "Surprisingly good Korean food for a small neighborhood place. They are just seconds from my house so I go in every few weeks for some take out. Everything I have ever eaten here has been great. The Galbi is excellent. All of the sides are fresh and tasty, and they vary from time to time so you can try different things if you go more than once. They even sell them in large jars if you want to stock up for the winter. The kimchi jigae is also great. Hot and Spicy just the way I like it. Even better when you have a terrible cold. The best Korean food I am aware of in Henderson. Yummy....... Think I'm headed over there right now.......Bye.\n",

Because we were super hungry, we order 1 more rice cake to eat during wAiting for the hotpot. The server just stay there and didnt bring for us any banchan until we require.\r\n",
      "The rice cake u can ask for spicy or not. We chose spicy. This kind of oily and make us feel bored very quickly. Not too much beef but it is okay because the price just only 9$ and it has a lot of rice cakes also. \r\n",
      "The hot pot was very boring, just a little bit of chicken, not too much meat and the rest is hot pepper and onion. The most terrible is very oily, OMG we have to remove a lot of oil before eating and made us have stomachache. I dont prefer to eat this hot pot. \r\n",
      "The price is cheap, i think we cannot expect more sth else. And around 7pm, this is rush hour, they line up to eat. We should hurry up, cannot let people wait for us when we were talkative here. \r\n",

      "So I go in to get take out.  Mind you I'm about 8 months pregnant.  Anyway, I ask if I can sit and wait, the man waiter says yes.  Take out hear takes about 5 to 10 min.  I'm sitting there for 2 min when this newer waitress who usually has a ponytail looks about 23 and has lots of earrings who I've had issues with before Bc I had asked for a container with a lid (which I've got many times before with no issues) says no it's for soup only.   Comes up to me and ask me to move bc she has customers.  I'm in no position to stand outside and wait for my food Bc it's much to painful at this point.   I let her know the man said I could sit. She walks away mad.  I think what the hell, it won't be long for my food to be done. I'm sure anyone with half a brain or even the ppl at the door waiting to sit would be considerate enough to let me sit those couple of mins more.  So when my food is done I'm fully intending to give the nice man a tip for take out.  As I'm paying I say to the man that he said could sit and that girl always gives me a hard time.  He says oh it's bc we have customers waiting and ppl eating in take priority over take out. I say you know I've been coming here since you've  opened and often (I've also introduced it to many now regulars)  he just shrugs his shoulders and says the place is small.  I say you know I was fully intending to tip the good service and he says for take out they don't get tips. Working is the service industry before I know that servers look for ways to get tips on take out.  So here I'm thinking what terrible service bc I'm probably going to tip them as much as the ppl sitting down and they will have to wait on then for at least 45 min.  I was so mad and disappointed I'm not sure I'm going to support them anymore even though food is really good and cheap.\n",

However, my friends and I are also students and according to the law we are not required to leave a tip if we don't want to. The fact that she blew up on us in front of everyone else and then expected us to give more tips is a joke. Unprofessional! Bad service! Never returning again. I wouldn't recommend this place.\n",

Our egg to put in the soup materialized 5 minutes to late to be of any use and was plopped down on the table with no explanation.    If we had been new to this cuisine, we would have had no idea what to do with it    Given its lateness, there was nothing for us to do with the egg anyway and it just sat there.

We ordered the beef bolgolgi and it tasted weird--really wrong--sickly sweet. There wasn't definitely something wrong with the broth. When I spoke to the manager, he refused to sample the soup himself or exchange it for something else--saying i would have to pay for it whether I wanted to or not. I didn't eat the soup but just picked at the side dishes--I would have left then and there but I didn't want to spoil my friend's evening with a scene. Then when we went to pay at the cashier, we found they had messed up our order and had overcharged us, as well! In the end, the food was not only awful but expensive--almost $20 for a soup and a bottle of beer.  I don't usually write review but I signed up for Yelp for this one! Absolutely terrible--terrible service, terrible food, terrible price. Could not pay me to return there...\n",

I can see why now, service is terrible and atmosphere was dead. No one spoke a word and the staff turned off the music for some reason. It was super awkward.

It may stem from my background with KBBQ in LA, but some aspects listed above really made the experience pretty mediocre compared to what I've had before.

      "We ordered the 10pcs combo wings as appetizer but it ended up coming out after the main entrees. Soy garlic flavor is delicious and very crispy, the hot and spicy flavor was FIRE, my entire face and chest were burning up, order only if you can handle a 8 out of 10 spiciness.  \r\n",

I tried to get some customer service out of her by asking her questions about the menu and what she liked.

It never cooled down and was almost unpleasant to eat. Eventually it started make the rice crispy (which i really like) then burning. I had to ask for a regular bowl to save my dish. \r\n",

No one came to check on us, refill our water, see if we liked the food. We had to flag down a waiter eventually, because none of them were looking in our direction. We finally got our waters refilled, and we sent back the calamari because it tasted terrible. The restaurant did get a bit busy after we placed our order, but that's no excuse for the terrible service we received. \r\n",

Server kept saying it's coming next but we waited. As for the food, it was mediocre. I got the bibimbap bowl and it was just a ton of rice with minimal chicken which you couldn't taste and a few veggies. Should have tried the fried chicken wings as that's what they are known for but I don't know if we will come back due to the service. Go elsewhere, waste of money here.\n",

      "The service was terrible. The server brought half our cups out in styrofoam and the other in normal glasses. The bathrooms were so bad I felt like I needed a shower after going inside it. The rice tasted burnt and not a lot of meat. I will not be going back there EVER and you shouldn't either. Also, she charged my card twice then said the second charge was voided. I felt bad tipping her even a 2 dollars.\n",

We had a large party reservation but were seated at separate tables in 2 groups with over 30 minutes time gap between seatings and on a separate checks and no sharing but still had to pay auto gratuity. We had no dedicated server for some reason so we had to call out to one of 4 employees every step of the way. We had to call out for someone's attention at least 10 times between requesting plates, water, food, beer, side dishes, things to flip and cut our own meat with, and the check and got dirty looks half the time because they weren't our server. Considering it was kinda expensive with a forced 18% tip and we cooked our own food (which I wouldn't mind if the price wasn't the cost of a full service restaurant) it was disappointing.\n",

      "Really friendly staff and good food.  They give you a nice selection of banchan and have almost any Korean dish you could want.  We usually get the Galbi or Dolsot Bibimbap or one of the soups (Kimchee Jigae, Gom Tang).  I've tried the soondobu here and although it's not terrible, I'm not a huge fan of it at this restaurant.  I also didn't particularly like their topoki (rice cake) here.  The korean pancake was good but HUMUNGOUS.  So be warned.  Once we did the grill your own meat portion which was also yummy-- a bit expensive and you have to get at least 2 of each meat dish in order to do it.  \r\n",

      "First of all they messed up my order, and while we were waiting, my friend's order included an ingredient that he was allergic to. The menu listed what was in the dish so we ordered based off that information. Unfortunately it was only until the dish came out that we realized that the menu was incorrect. We told them nicely indicating that my friend was allergic and was expecting that they would remake the dish. Not only did they not want to remake it, they insisted that I had to pay for both items! It was only after a heated argument that they said they would only switch the item for something cheaper, which we agreed to. Obviously before we were finished our meal, the same man gave us our bill indicating to us to leave. The food was okay but the service was so terrible I would never return again.\n",

      "BUT, the service is just horrible. Especially with take-out. I don't have much to complain with when you dine in, but when it comes to take-out, it is just horrible. The place is just impossible to park (right along Yonge). And I usually take out when I just don't have the time to dine in -- I am sure that is what people usually do. But the owners just never care about other people's time. I always phone 10-15 mins before I arrive so that they have the time to pack everything when I drive there for me to pick up right away. And I always double-confirm with them, if they are busy and if I can pick up within 10-15 min. The answer was always certain. BUT the fact is, they always cook or pack the food when I get there. Then for the next 10-15mins you will just see my car in the middle of Yonge Street blinking on its emergency lights. This has happened soo many times, that it once really got on my nerves and I complained about it. They apologized, but did nothing. Next time it was still the same. There was even one time that I chose to walk there, because I knew they would not pack my food until I get there, and I did not want my car to be in the middle of the street for 15 mins. And that time, they made me wait for 20 mins standing there. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One more terrible thing with their take-out service, is the way they pack their stew. I ordered soon tofu stew a few times for take out,. The rice bowl was placed right next to the tall stew jar. When I held up the plastic bags on my way home, the rice bowl would just be squeezed in to the body of tall stew jar. And apparently the food jar was just not strong enough for the pressure and it broke from the middle. Every time I got home, I was left with a plastic bag full of stew, and nothing left in the jar.. .....\r\n",

      "I have been a loyal customer for the past 8 years, and nothing has changed after I complained for so many times. Today, again, despite the fact that I called them for take out 12 mins ahead, and told them I will be there soon for just one bibimbap (bibimbap is all pre-made, they just need to pack in a container), nothing was ready when I got there. My car was blinking on Yonge for another 10 mins until I really ran out of patience.. I think this would just be the last time I have ever visited the place. ..\n",

The food was overall pretty decent. I went in a group of 9 people for a church outing and their customer service was absolutely terrible. We ordered 3 gan jjajangs, 3 jjampongs, 1 order of yang jang pi and gganpoong shrimp. Again, the food is pretty decent but service was horrendous. We asked for extra bowls, napkins and water. The waitress provided 3 bowls for 9 people to share and returned with no extra napkins and refilled out waters half way! We then asked for more bowls a second time and the waitress claimed that they had no more bowls and walked away shaking her head with a very blatant negative attitude. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone!\n",

We had 6 adults and 1 child.  We ordered (1) Kung Pao Shrimp, (4) noodle specials, (2) black bean noodles, and (1) Vegetable and Rice Platter. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were given our drinks first.  The water was horrendous.  I remember that they used to serve filtered water and it tasted great.  I believe the new owners probably didn't see the need for filtered water and just used straight up Chandler tap water. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyways, we sat for 1 hour until our first dishes came out.  The Kung Pao Shrimp and Vegetable Rice Platter.  The Kung Pao Shrimp is usually not deep fried, but the outer portion was not even crispy.  The sauce was bland and the vegetables were old.  The onions and bell peppers tasted so old.  The Vegetable Rice Platter was just deep fried rice, vegetable assortment and mushrooms and whatever they felt like they needed to throw away.  The mushrooms especially were just gross!  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We waited another 15-20 minutes for the Noodles to come out.  The black bean noodles were disgusting.  The sauce had so much corn starch and salt that it was unbearable.  The prior owners made the noodles very good, but usually the sauce was watery.  However the new owners put more starch and more salt and it was just unbearable.  The best thing that came out was the noodle special because everything else tasted so terrible and it was the cheapest thing.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even though we sat there no waitress came by or even acknowledged what was going on.  In addition, there were probably 3-4 tables in there tops.  My father asked why everything took so long and the waitress just said that there were so many orders.  And we asked them to just take a look around the restaurant.  She just apologized repeatedly. \r\n",

      "Then when we got our bill, they took the liberty to tack on the 18% gratuity on top of our bill.  We only had 6 adults and 1 child!.  We went in for the 5.99 special and came out with a over 100 dollar tab.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I just got home and needed to write this in order to let people know not to waste their money.  It's the same look, but everything is terribly wrong here.  It will probably go out of business if they don't take notice of what's going on.  I'm just praying that I don't get food poisoning.\n",

We have tried several of their menu items and both us being well versed in Korean cuisine agree that the food is always delicious. I have only been disappointed once by their food, and that was when I order the Hae Do Bap(pardon the spelling) which is sashimi over salad and rice with a spicy korean sauce. The sashimi was served to me still partially frozen which I thought was quite horific, not to mention I was seriously craving Hae Do Bap that evening so that was a huge let down. The service is alright  nothing fantastic and nothing terrible. The waitress we usually get seems quite bored which can throw off the mood sometimes, but I overlook it because the food still comes in a timely fashion and is always tasty (except that one time of course).\r\n",

      "Now recently I've been taking my mom and step father there for dinner and they enjoy it as well. My mom always gets the seafood tofu soup (Hael Mul Soon Doo Boo?) and my step father gets korean barbecue. He has fun being able to grill up his food and rolling the meat up in lettuce wraps. The portions are never an issue, every item so far is perfect for one person and sometimes two depending on how hungry the individual is.\r\n",

      "In short, food is great, just don't get that sashimi salad I was talking about! Service is alright which is why I am giving the place four stars. I will definitely continue to eat here.

I don't often recommend not going somewhere however if your in the area save your time and money because this place is a train wreck. Wouldn't be surprised if it's closed in a month. Gordon Ramsey couldn't even turn this place around.\n",

      "The food is just fine; i had bibimbap. But the service is horrible! horrible! I was shock by how terrible their service was! and also they impose 18% of gratuity on the bill, which doesn't make sense at all. The environment just makes me not want to go again :(\n",

      "I dined in with my wife and child one night and ordered take out the next day because I read the reviews and everyone was raving about the KFC(Korean Fried Chicken). When we dined in, we ordered the Korean Hot Pot(Spicy Beef Hot Pot), which is different than Chinese Hot Pot in that its not as flavorful with the variety of meats and veggies. The Hot Pot was good but didnt come with much of anything. Be aware that everything in addition to what what you want costs extra. If you want extra rice its more money, if you want your food in a hot bowl, it costs extra. I think it is a little ridiculous what they charge extra for. Now on to the Korean Fried Chicken. I read the reviews and everyone said it was amazing. I ordered it on Tuesday, because this is the only day you can order it, and brought it home. I was assuming it be a deep fried chicken pieces but it was actually barbeque chicken wings with sesame seeds on it. They werent terrible but nothing like what I expected and they were not amazing like all the reviews I had read about them. So I would not order them again, they were not worth it. I might go back and try the bibimap one of these days but probably not anytime soon\n",

      "My Wife and I decided to try this place a couple weeks ago.  What a big mistake on our part.  This place is terrible.  The older woman who waited on us was very unfriendly and gave me the impression that she did not want to be there waiting on customers.  My wife ordered a chicken entree and I ordered a pork dish.  Both arrived semi warm.  There seemed to be a party going on in the kitchen as the music was loud and not customer oriented.  The waitress, after serving our dinners, stood against the front wall and did not return to our table until we moitioned for a check.  Having eaten Japanese and Korean all over the world I would rate this place as bottom of the bottom.  I don't think this place will last long.\n",

The server took forever to take our order and when we told her we wanted to order AYCE, she gave us a piece of paper to mark what we wanted. This took another 5 minutes for her to come back even after she acknowledged that we were ready to order.\r\n",

      "The place was great when it first opened and a few times after that. WHAT happened? Quality of the food definitely went down and so did the service. The Kalbi was all gristle and talk about skimping on the Panchan (small side dishes), which came out late. They usually bring those out right away. We saw tables that got theirs even though they came in quite some time after we did. We came between 7:00p till about 8:30pm and the service was SLOW. The part that really got under our skin was the unbelievably RUDE and un-attentive waitresses we had that were waiting on us. Definitely not the norm for Korean restaurants. They never smiled. Had no patience. And when my mother asked one of the waitresses a simple question about the side dishes the table next to us was getting (as they had the side dishes we used to get the first few times we came to the restaurant--A LOT more and varietal), she literally gave my mom a dirty look and blurted out an answer that neither of us could understand. My mom looked at me and I had no idea what she had said so, my mother asked again. I don't know if the woman was speaking Korean because it sure didn't sound like it to us and that's my mother's native language. Regardless, she was annoyed because we kept on asking her what she was saying. The woman literally walked away. It was time for the check. It's sad because we really liked this place and always had a good experience before. Granted, we used to come during the day but, it still doesn't give them the excuse to have terrible staff in the evenings not to mention, lower the quality of their food. That was definitely disappointing to say the least. The bathroom had a bad leak of some sort in one of the stalls, there was a pool of water in the stalls. I mentioned it to one of the staff members because someone could slip and fall. The woman didn't even stop to listen to me.\n",

To my shock and awe, I actually like it (I'm the pickiest eater ever and eat nothing but chicken fingers & mashed potatoes).  So, with the discovery of Korean BBQ, we, with a group of friends, decided to go to Lee's.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First of all, before you even think about getting the all you can eat BBQ, everyone at the table has to agree to it.  The dinner pricing for AYCE is $29.99, which isn't absolutely terrible but still a lot to pay for one meal/per person.  They really do let you keep it coming.  The food itself wasn't bad at all.  We got pork belly, pork shoulder, bulgogi and a variety of other things and, of course, it comes with the normal spread of traditional Korean eats like kimchi.  What I like about Korean BBQ is that I can cook it myself for as long as I want (I like my meats a little burned - I know, I'm a weirdo.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyway, like I said, the food was good.  However, this place is only getting 3 stars because the service was awful.  Our waitress looked like we were wasting her time.  She really couldn't give two shits about us & the fact that we were all paying $30 each to eat (which is a lot for one meal/per person!!).  We repeatedly asked for drinks that were never delivered.  When she would pass our table, we would say 'excuse me' in English & Korean (we had a few people that could speak a bit of Korean with us) and she completely ignored us until she decided it was time to check on the table.  She got super pissed when we asked for the beer that she never delivered.  & then we sat for probably close to 30 minutes waiting for the check and finally had to ask a different server for it.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I re-read this whole review, I feel like downgrading a star but I'll leave it at 3 since the food was good.  But man... they really need to get some servers who can at least pretend like they care about the customers.  Next time we want Korean BBQ, we are going to Tofu Hut!\n",

Me and my boyfriend sat down to eat and they serve us not only small portions but terrible sides that ended up making my boy friend so sick that he ended up throwing up at the table because he just couldn't make it quick enough to the bath room. Once I let the waitress know what happened her first response was it's him not our food, then asks if we want the check. By the time we got our food up until he got was give or take 10 mins. We ordered all you can eat with the biggest options and that was 35 dollars a person. She tried to charge us full price for 10 min which was crazy I refused to pay and ended up leaving! I recommend to just go to tofu hut they are always very good and never disappoint\n",

      "When my roommate and I walked inside, I noticed that the restaurant was busy, so while I was prepared to wait a minute, I was not prepared to be completely ignored by the hostess while she ran from behind the register to deliver something to a table. I figured she would at least acknowledge us upon returning, but instead she went to the kitchen for a few minutes before finally greeting us, which was a relief, since I was starting to think that I had somehow managed to turn invisible. She told us that it would be about ten minutes, and then we sat in the little waiting chairs. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About five minutes later, another party came in. This was a party of three. They sat down next to us to wait as well. Somewhere between five and ten minutes later, a second party of two entered and stood at the counter. At this point, the hostess says something while gesturing toward a table. Logic dictating that since we were the first arrival, we would be the ones to be seated, I stood and took a step. The hostess quickly shattered the notion with a halting gesture while ushering in the party of three. \r\n",

Grudgingly calmed for a moment, I settled back into my seat. Of course, when the waitress returned and seated the pair of gentlemen that entered AT LEAST ten minutes after us, I may have had a minor meltdown. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I explained to the manager that there was a chance that her restaurant may just be kind of busy and extremely disorganized, but it kind of felt more like we were ignored because we were the only one of the parties that greeted the hostess in English rather than Korean. \r\n",

      "Gods below, I wish I were a more rational human being. At least the waitress got our first order of meats correct, and didn't bring something completely unwanted to the table. Meanwhile, the bean paste soup was the first item I had ordered. After three attempts, it was the last item to arrive. Our drink order took two tries, as did our request for hot sauce. And refills? Yeah, if I would have held my breath I would probably be typing this from the beyond. None to be had. I shudder to imagine how this would have went if not for the poor girl bussing tables. Even she was practically ignored when she attempted to bring the waitress back to our table. \r\n",

My group was mostly white and we noticed that the Asian people were served much more promptly. They didn't refill our waters either. I have honestly never experienced this poor of service at any restaurant, fast food included. The starting price for a dinner, the cheapest option, is $20. For the price the service is a joke. \r\n",

A lady said they would call a meeting to improve the service here but based on the other reviews and from talking to my local friends here this poor service has been going on for a long time. I want to like this restaurant and if they could address this service issue they'd have a great operation, because the food is great. Vegas has many options for KBBQ. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Lee's.\n",

      "The first 2 times my wife and I came here we really liked this place. The quality of the meat was very good. The other Korean dishes were very good to and the service was very good.  Something has happened lately though to change my opinion. The service is terrible. A couple months ago my wife and I came with one of her friends for lunch and the service was so bad we were embarrassed to have brought our friend.  The person serving us was not friendly nor very interested in helping us.  So my wife and I try again tonight and it was worst. As we entered the restaurant a lady near the back just yelled and pointed at the front area and told us to pick a table.  We sat down waited for a while and no one came over to the table. We finally walked out and drove down the road to Sura Korean BBQ where the service was excellent. I hope Lee's BBQ reads this and improves their service as their food was pretty good.\n",

We weren't welcomed at all, we can see bad reactions from everyone in there. I'd say food is very good but service is terrible. The waitress didn't change our cooking plate, she just wiped it with napkins. I decided to stop eating after that. If you want to charge any customers 18% for the gratuity, you must tell them first or put any notices that they can see. We definitely won't go there again and I have to tell others about this.\n",

You order and it's never ready You wait for your order. Check your order it's usually wrong. What a shame to have had such a great place to eat and now it's gone downhill.

The Lobster Kung Pao and the Korean BBQ Ribs. The ribs were super mediocre. I've had better at any number of hole in the wall places around the country. They were tough and a mostly flavorless. And served on a giant bed of raw onion. Huh? But the Lobster Kung Pao was terrible. And 85$! Not only does the preparation and presentation make it nearly impossible to dig out the lobster but the spices totally overwhelm it. So you might as well be eating chicken for 1/4 the price. Service was great and the place has a fun vibe.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "So why the bad review? The place has been slowly going downhill and becoming more and more of a hassle to deal with, to the point where it's not worth dealing with their nonsense just to shop here. Their prices are the same or higher than other asian markets like T&T or PATs but their service to non-Koreans is terrible. Their product selection is fine but nothing special that you can't find in other places.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My issues with them started when I tried to use my points to get a bag of rice that is part of their points program. I asked if I can get it with points, the cashier flat out said no, I asked if I could talk to their customer service and do it there or how I could go about it, she didn't understand what I was trying to say. Eventually after 2-3 minutes of waiting around I just paid for it and left. I didn't think that a $7 bag of rice was worth holding up a whole line for, but clearly the points system is hit or miss, and yes I have since checked on their website the bag is redeemable through points.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My second issue with them is that they are flat out racist to non-Koreans, I noticed this initially when I saw a few people arguing about ID over loto tickets but thought nothing about it until I saw it happen more and more often. Funny enough it was always with people who didn't speak Korean and somehow their Drivers license just wasn't a good enough piece of ID for them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Since they started selling beer I've had the same problem, 3/3 times that I've tried to buy beer from them I've been IDed despite being almost 30, half my hair being grey and having a beard, I'm guessing that's a hip new look for 16 year olds trying to illegally buy beer because surprise surprise, they do not ID people who speak Korean, young or old. Other non-Korean people were just as surprised as I was when they got asked for ID despite clearly not being under age but if the store policy is to ID everyone regardless, they're not doing a good job of that either. I've been IDed once in the last 7 years buying alcohol and 3 times in 1 month here, just to give you an idea. I'm sure they realize that it's rude and impolite to needlessly ID people and then sit around arguing about it AFTER they have given you valid ID, which is probably why they don't ID Korean people all that often, I just wish they'd give the same respect to the rest of us. Especially when you've been a regular at the store for 6+ months.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That said, no thanks, I'll go somewhere that won't treat me worse just because I'm not part of their racial group. T&T, PATs, Seasons, etc will treat you just fine regardless of your race, and that's the way it should be, this is Canada after all.\r\n",

As a person who eats sashimi a lot, the colour of the tuna was almost grey and the salmon was hardly even pink/orange. Also the taste was very fishy (If fish is fresh it shouldn't have a smelly/fishy taste). Lastly, the rice was way undercooked, it was crunchy and dry. I have had my fair share of poke bowls and this place by far has been the worst. I was actually frightened that I might have gotten food poisoning. Thankfully, I was fine. Definitely do not recommend!\n",

      "Ordered the kalbi with cold noodles and the pork bone soup. Appetizers came .... kimchi is terrible ... the apps just weren't great. Cold noodles was rather on the warmer side and there's no ice slush?.... the kalbi was done well. Pork bone soup surprisingly was probably the highlight of the meal. Nothing special about Onnuri but it's a decent place to get a quick fix for Korean food... Also the plaza they're in is always super hard to find parking and it's a small lot. You would have to park in the plaza next to it then walk over which is also an inconvenience as well.\n",

I tend to switch between a soup or the spicy pork galbi. The food, along with the sides, is typically good. Service is a hit or miss. If they're busy, they will neglect you for a long time, and the bell buttons on each table are not very helpful. The waitresses tend to panic when they get busy. Regardless, my boyfriend and I have always left tip. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Today, service was terrible. We arrived around 8:30pm. Many customers were already finished eating at this point, so it wasn't so busy. Our waitress must have already been in a bad mood because she wasn't very attentive. We never got our drinks refilled. She also wasn't very happy when my boyfriend asked for a fork and extra plate. At around 9:15pm, we asked for extra sides. She said their kitchen closed, even though the restaurant was still open until 10:00pm. Fine. At 9:30pm, a family came in. The same waitress seated them and took their order. We thought the kitchen was closed? Confused, my boyfriend and I decided at this point that we would not leave a generous tip. We left a $2 tip and left. Then the waitress came running after us. She was baffled that we left such a small tip and she strongly believed that she offered us good service tonight. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First of all, who runs after customers to ask for more tip? The amount of the tip is based on YOUR service--and although it is highly recommended, it is still the customer's choice. After adding an additional $5 tip, I told her that my boyfriend and I have enjoyed coming to this restaurant, but that we will no longer be coming. And that will be the final tip from us.\n",

      "Portions are smaller, which is fine because the food is totally different.  The meat is no longer marinated before cooking.  My chicken was pale and unappetizing and flavorless.  Macaroni salad had no taste.  I ordered the combo and it came with a tiny small piece of kalbi, one piece of mijun, and one piece of bland chicken.  I also ordered a chicken teriyaki plate.  Then they gave me one container of kimchee and one small container of macaroni salad, they used to give you those per plate, and now only one? it didn't make sense.\r\n",
      "It's terrible, go to the original island style on Sahara.\r\n",
      "update: i just ate more of it, the rice is overcooked and mushy, and kalbi also had no taste.  OH and the middle of the chicken was still pink!!!-gave it to the dog, at least someone get so enjoy it.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I always take people here who have not tried Korean food.  Kind of a soft landing in terms of spiciness, etc.  Personally, I find the food there borderline-bland.  But they have a lot of choices for people who don't care for spice and who have not had Korean food before.  Personally, I need a barrage of flavours - gochu, pa, yangpa, gaenip, etc., (red pepper, scallion, onions, perilla (shiso) leaf, etc)., to wake up my tastebuds.  Not a terrible place, but not a place I would go out of my way to frequent.  Nice lady owns the place - very friendly and courteous to her guests.  They've been around for a long time and one of the original Korean restaurants in Korean-town.\n",

      "My family and I were visiting from the States and we wanted some Korean food because we love eating it. We got to the restaurant and the first server was terrible. He showed us the table that was near the front door and my parents didn't want to get cold so they asked for a different table. The guy said that's the only table they have when there was literally two tables that could be pushed together to make four but it was whatever. Then the server hurriedly gave us water like he didn't want to be there. And when we finished telling him our order, my dad barely could close the menu before he was already grabbing it. The music was nice, very modern, but I think it caused him to hear the wrong order so we went to go change it and the guy we changed it with was A LOT nicer. \r\n",
      "Then we got to the food and it was decent, I recommend the Tako Yaki and the Soy and Garlic fried chicken. \r\n",
      "At the end when my dad and I went up to pay, the first waiter took our money and when I asked him for two boxes he just looked at me for a couple of seconds and slightly rolled his eyes before giving it to me. I'm not sure if he was just tired and moody because he accidentally dropped and broke a bowl when cleaning another table. And when my mom asked for a bag because he didn't give us one to put our boxes in, he said something and my mom asked him to repeat it and he just waved her off. \r\n",
      "Honestly, his poor service really ruined the experience for us. Another group came and asked for carry out and he said it'd take an hour.... there was maybe only four other tables in the restaurant. If you can deal with bad service, then check his place out but otherwise, it might be better to spend your money elsewhere.\n",

      "I called in to make a takeout order for plain boneless fried chicken way ahead of time and when I got to the restaurant, they gave me boneless sweet and spicy chicken. When I spoke with one of the workers there, he said that he will make the chicken again but I'll have to wait all over again. I asked if there is any compensation for this inconvenience and he said there's none with a very uninterested attitude. He claimed that the server who took my order is not there and he can't do anything at all. NOTHING. Later, that server came back and both of them were saying that I WAS THE ONE WHO ORDERED BONELESS SPICY chicken. I can't eat spicy food so there is no way I would've ordered spicy chicken. They then continued to repeat that they can't do anything. I asked to speak with someone who can do something and they said that the manager can be reached AFTER THE BASKETBALL GAME and they said that I can stay at the restaurant and wait. That is terrible customer service and I can't believe they had the audacity to ask a customer to wait the length is a basketball game to speak to a manager. They then said that I can call the restaurant back AFTER THE FREAKIN GAME, they didn't even offer to have the manager reach out to me about this issue at all. I had to be the one who requested to have the manager call me because this is just ridiculous. This is terrible customer service. I am so disappointed.\n",

      "Their main menu Fried Chicken tastes terrible, worst experience ever. Never had that terrible chicken in my life. Also the chicken feet is horrible. Actually my standard for food is very low. I wasted $70 on uneatable food. Wish there are no more people waste money there.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "To preface, given that this is my first yelp post (yes, I was THAT motivated to contribute this review), the factors that make a great restaurant for me are: the food (it's gotta be good); the service (impeccable); the atmosphere (chill and unstuffy--no white glove service for me, thanks); the wine/cocktail offerings.  ...and the yardsticks that comprise some of my favourites: The River Cafe; Nopi; Bouchon (Yountville), although the French Laundry is pretty great, too; L'Atelier du Robuchon; Chez Panisse; Matbaren and Ulla Windbladh; Lupa; Blue Ribbon sushi; Osteria alle Testiere.  Domestically: Vij's; Crazyweed; Le Vin Papillon; the bar at Alo; Bar Isabel's late night menu; L'Express.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To be fair, the only reason why DOMA deserves any part of a star is the atmosphere.  The interior is sort of Scandi-Japanese--light woods, white paint and somewhat rustic--which is a current crowd-pleaser.  I would have also said the service as it seemed pretty friendly if it weren't for the end of the evening when we had a lot of leftover rib on our plate, asked for it to go and were informed that they had no take-out containers/they don't do take-out.  Ur, wha'?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food is terrible.  We were given a wee speech about the food and whether it may be Korean with a French influence or vice versa, and to suspend judgement until we had tasted all our dishes.  Alas, it was neither.  It was a lovely gesture to be given two amuses bouches to start off, but they had no flavour.  No discernable flavour--how is that possible?  Consequently, I was shocked when the server announced that this was the only dish featuring kimchi?  Um, kimchi is no wallflower ingredient, so where was it hiding--back in the kitchen?  Next up, the Korean chicken thigh.  Who mucks up a chicken thigh?  Unfortunately, these guys do.  Perhaps a visit Bar Isabel, late at night, to see how it can be done...  The seafood ravioli--meh.  ...and then the ribs.  We each had a bite and had to throw in the towel and cut our losses.  For one, because we ran out of wine, but not for want of trying.  Although their wine offerings are overpriced, even for Toronto (bog-standard bottles that are widely available at the LCBO and for which they charge ~400% mark-up) and even those that seemed interesting (we tried to order three of them) they were all sold out with no offers of any interim replacements.  So we stuck to a couple of glasses each.  A quick return to a menu comment: why are there so few offerings on the menu?  I mean, if you're Brothers and offer an equally small menu, at least a diner can find solace in the fact that anything you order will be excellent...\r\n",

      "Traditional strip mall Chinese fare. The wonton soup was interesting, lettuce and celery bits in it, but only one or two wontons in the one size that they offer. Chicken fried rice was a lot of fried rice, beans sprouts, and a couple large pieces of chicken. Not terrible, but not great either. I ordered takeout, but the seating area looked fine if a bit small.\n",

      "I came here with my GF intent upon feasting on those plump giant mandu my friend spoke of just the day before. Walking in, the place felt like a modern cafeteria or a midscale food court, with the staff eating in the far corner and much of the restaurant quite empty. Part of the impression, I guess, stems from the fact that one of the tables we were seated close to had not been cleared out. This struck me as odd, as every other Korean restaurant I've been to, servers are lightning quick in clearing out and cleaning the table to be ready for the next customer. But hey, it wasn't busy and when it's break time, it's break time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we sat down I immediately sensed something with the furniture was off. The table was just at my navel's level. I'm an average/short guy and have average to terrible posture. Korean table manners (correct me if I'm wrong or if this is something more relaxed in N. America) dictate that serve/flatware are to remain on the table, never to be lifted at any point. These two points taken together: anyone 5'7 or taller would have to be awkwardly hunchback for the duration of their meal. Most decidedly not the best ergonomics.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We ordered the dolsot bibimbap (love me some of that yolk and gochujang-kissed bibimbap socarrat), spicy pork, kalguksoo, and of course, the giant mandu. The bibimbap and pork were acceptable, nothing particularly remarkable. The handmade noodles were delicious, especially the broth---perfect for today's weather. The mandu tasted good. However, I felt the texture of the actual filling a little off-putting. I'm not sure how much integrity I'm to expect, but the meat/vegetable interior crumbled clumsily apart when biting into it (maybe this is normal and I'm unable to appreciate real mandu?). It was otherwise juicy and savoury, and further enhanced with soy sauce.\r\n",

The waitress started out great explaining everything to us but I couldn't tell you who she was since 2 people ran our food and another topped our water. The we had short ribs that were really good, but that's where it ended. We had chicken wings that were big but dry and overcooked. The house sauce was ok but it tasted like it could be hot and BBQ from any chain. We also had the teriyaki chicken wraps. The sauce was just dropped on the chicken, not authentic and it was maybe half a breast. There was not enough food to fill the 5 lettuce. There wasn't even 5 pieces of Thai basil or garlic. They gave us a coupon when we checked in and the layout was nice but going down the steep steps in heels after a few drinks is a law suit waiting to happen. Overall it wasn't terrible but I won't be back\n",

The walls were covered in layers of dust and splatters of hoisin sauce and Sriracha. The floors were so sticky that I had residue on the bottom of my shoes, so as I walked out I was still sticking the ground. Their fake flowers have so much dust, that it began to fall when the A/C blew on it. My first impression of the restaurant was terrible and the waiter was very pushy to take my order as he hovered by the table until I made my decision. \r\n",

The food did not taste good,  but I am a kind of person that knows the preciousness of food, so I continued to eat. The meat was dry and very chewy and the egg roll lacked flavor. I had very little Bun and had a lot of sour vegetables at the bottom of my bowl. \r\n",

We ended up leaving because we waited for over 40 mins and we still didn't get the rest out of the food. Not only that, when we asked numerous they kept saying 5 mins but when we got up and left, they were rude and told us that the rest of the food takes very long to make (they should have stated this before when we were ordering). I wouldn't have mind if I waiting if they told us beforehand but honestly 40 mins is unreasonable.\n",

They all have a daggering look as if there is a serious problem almost on a personal level collectively from the whole staff. We received a beef stew with two fine edible pieces of meat and the rest literally fat. When we asked the first waiter to take it back they just left the table and another waiter came by and asked what was wrong and continued to argue and proclaim the fat is there to savor the flavor,  which I understand, I asked is the fat supposed to eaten? (sarcastically) No. The problem isn't that there's too much fat on the meat, there is no meat. Jumping straight to it he said he would take it back with no refund. I will never come back here ever again I don't know how service gets any worse. On top of It already, it smells terrible in here and the bus boys cleaning random kitchen utensils in buckets on the front tables. I guess it does get worse. Don't come here.\n",

We asked the waiter to give us a new bowl and he recommended he just microwave the bowl. All the noodles were not cooked and he meat impossible to eat. All our dishes were inedible.

Probably with daddy roach reproducing more and more brothers and sisters so that baby roach won't be alone. Or maybe they are in the kitchen feasting on the delicious pho (hey, I don't blame them). Yes, it was just a little roach and yes it did freak me out, and yes we all know that when there's one theres probably many...

Mind the fact they set the table for the size of your party before seating you. Including all the sides before you order. After ordering I quickly, I figured out our grill was a little bit below the bar. It took probably about a good twenty minutes before it was really cooking the meat (It was set on three flames which is the highest besides maxing it out, so it really was just a terrible grill). I was sadly, missing that first great sizzle as you're setting your meat out to cook. Once we got the grill fired up and hot, everything was easy and the service was excellent. They check on you often and bring everything in a timely manner. One miss is that once the grill side filled up, it becomes very hot and the humidity is very noticeable, even with the vents on. I personally think their vents could be stronger. Considering I had a lot of bbq meat facials during the cooking process. I enjoyed what we ordered but wasn't blown away from anything. Great place for a quick fix but there are better places out there.\n",

      "I obviously made a very very poor decision here because I did not choose to go with the all you can eat menu.  We got here around 11pm on Thursday night and there was a 45-60 minute wait, since there are only a few tables available for bbq.  We saw some other people eating off the menu, so we decided to do that instead.  We opted for one of the stews and it was terrible.  Everything in it tasted like it was just quickly thrown together- from the soup base to the dumplings. The soup base tasted like one of those premade tofu soup packages that you get from Asian grocery stores mixed with some frozen dumplings that you also get from the grocery stores.  DId not like it AT ALL.  The service wasn't bad... they were pretty attentive.  If I'm ever back here, I'll try the bbq instead.\n",

Jab-che was over seasoned with too much soysauce. Kimchi was too old and jun was all burned. One side of jun was all black and tasted nothing more than flour. Sun-tofu was not bad but not good either. We ordered spicy but it wasnt spicy at all. Guk-su was terrible. Too much vinegar was used.. i almost threw up while eating. Staff was not bad. They walj around with ice water and refill it everytime you ask. Overall i will never go back. I cant believe tofu hut became this horrible. It wasnt used to be this bad. I will rather wait until mr. Tofu opens on weekdays. Please do taste before serving dishes to customers!!!\n",

      "I've been going to Tofu Hut since my high school years and I've always had such mixed feelings about this place. There are times when my friends and I loved this place and would have a fantastic time, but sometimes we've gotten such terrible service that one of us actually stood up and left. The food, for me, was always good. I actually never tried ayce korean bbq until recently--which I enjoyed very much. For $13.99 (lunch price) I got beef tongue and pork belly; and I also shared brisket and sliced bbq with my friend.  They came in huge servings, which made it difficult for two girls to finish all that meat haha. Banchan's were standard. I've always like fish cake, so that was my favorite out of the rest. Sundobu, or however you spell it, was also okay. Their customer service is so bipolar that sometimes, even though I will be craving to go back to this place from time to time, that I would just avoid Tofu Hut all together. I think ever since I've graduated from high school, I would only go here once a year. Which is sad since the food CAN be worth the trip. Bad service included: wait staff showing attitude; wait staff seems to be non existent for quite a while during our visit; complained about splitting the check; forgetting orders and kept reminding of order; had trouble asking for refills; and last, was that they kept giving my party dirty looks because we stayed there for hours (even though we'd still order some food). This place just needs to be consistent in service and food, and I'm sure this will become a new-found favorite of my friends and I to eat at.\n",

Not even a dessert. The meat was low quality. All of the meat we ordered in the All-Day-Menu was extremely fatty. The grill already had fat all around the sides. The brisket was so thick and chewy and had so much fat. It honestly felt like I was only eating oil and fat. The kimchi... wasn't even CUT. They gave us a quarter of a cabbage. Had to cut the kimchi ourselves. The workers talked to themselves more than serving the customers. Overall terrible experience. \r\n",

My wife and I ordered the exact same mixed soondubu spicy, and yet, hers tasted burnt and mine was just straight up terrible. It was bland and tasted like tap water. Wtf. The banchan, especially the japchae, looked like it was saved since the Josean era. It was as bad as it looked, dry as a MF.

The waitress was giving us looks when we asked for more side dishes.

However, this place has a warm and inviting vibe which I really liked and the modern decor was just a plus.  The side dishes were really good with reasonable spiciness and saltiness.

      "Terrible business ethics.  They automatically add 15% tip when paying with credit card and don't give you a choice.  Had lunch there the other day.  No issue with the food but the service was terrible.  After waiting for our table, sat down and ordered.  We were only provided with a napkin and paper placemat.  When the food came we had to ask for chopsticks and spoons.  Kimchee side dish was tiny, about 2 fingers worth in size.  Then we had to ask for the condiments that should have arrived with the dish.  Midway through asked for more kimchee.  It never came and they were too busy, we gave up because by this time we finished eating.  When we went to pay the terminal didn't give the option to tip zero.  When selecting no to add a tip, it automatically added it anyway (tricky).  Had to tell owner who said tipping was mandatory. He asked what was the problem.  We told him.  Rather than be concerned with the poor service we received or apologize he got mad at us and re-did the transaction with no tip using some secret code on the terminal .  How they set up their credit card terminal is unethical, possibly illegal and demonstrates utter disregard for service.  Tipping is a customer's prerogative based on service not an owner's entitlement to extra margin.  Will never go there again.\n",

The noodles tasted OK, but I'm not exactly a fan of the cold slush now that I've tried it. What ended up happening was I devoured all the veggies and left the soup relatively untouched. I think I'll settle for a warmer entree next time.\r\n",

I ordered the kinoko burger with jazz fries. The burger was good but when I got the jazz fries they gave me just garlic fries with the crack sauce n ketchup no gravy. First if u get it on the food truck jazz fries are like $4 dollars but here its $7 dollar y? So i asked the waiter y no gravy he said he didnt know it comes w gravy and he doesnt know the menu. I was shocked a waiter who didnt know the menu??? Then ordered a taro boba. I love boba so when I got the boba it was good but no boba just taro slush. On a normal place they ask u if you want boba or not. The waiter didnt even ask me at all. I didnt see the waiter all thru my meal he didnt even check on us if we r good. Only person we see is the dim sung lady. So after the meal I asked the dim sung lady for the bill some else gave us the check but ackwardly stand next to me watching me waiting for me to pay then when i did he still stood there watching me as i sign the bill. I never seen a restuarant do that. The concept is good. Its like a asian hipsters hang out in the middle of the strip but the food are over priced and the service is a cluster fuck n terrible.

When we were getting up to leave, the server was questioning whether we paid or not and we told her we did. With hesitation, the server quickly walked over to the counter to check with the man dealing with the bills. They clearly don't know how to serve or manage this restaurant. If anything, she should have checked at the front to make sure everything was paid for before giving us the dumplings, rather than questioning us if we paid or not.

They told us that it was because the restaurant was getting busy and people were waiting, but still! I just wanted to eat my sumo dumplings the way I want ...

Bad sauce and bad batter, is just unforgiveable. I didn't even finish it, and had no desire to take the rest home. If you know me, that's a very very rare thing.

      "Heed everyone's warning: The service here is TERRIBLE. But you get what you pay for, right? For $16/person + tax and tip, this is one of the cheaper places to go to if you want AYCE KBBQ. \r\n",

      "I have been to Korean Garden a couple of times with my friends. My experiences with them were pretty pleasant so I decided to take my family here. Worst decision ever. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Given the fact that the service here is already terrible, the staffs are not one bit nice about it at all. Here's what really ticked me off:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      " 1) They bring the meat to the table but they take forever to come back to put it on the grill. (Trust me, I would love to do the cooking myself but I got called out before for touching the tongs/scissors). They need an excuse for that gratuity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2) They automatically get gratuity because it's their house rule. I get it that they cook the food/cut the meats on the grill but most of the time they are not around to do it anyway. They probably know that if they leave it to the customers to tip they would get 0 tip because of how bad their service is. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3) The time limit of 1 hour and 30 minutes is not enough because I spent 45+ minutes of that time, waiting. I was not able to enjoy my meal because they were so slow that I practically just waited all that time. Waiting for the meat, waiting for the drinks, waiting for the bill, etc. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I probably would not be back anymore. I would rather shell out a few more dollars in a nicer spot where they actually care for their customers rather than be given mediocre food and bad service. My suggestion would be, go here off peak hours - maybe the service would be better.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I went here for Christmas Eve with my family and to start off I WILL NEVER GO BACK! I do not recommend this place to anyone please do yourself a favor. The service was absolutely horrible, it was hard to interact with the employees, they took over an hour to bring us our second round of bbq by that time we were just waiting and not hungry. The waiter was rude to top it off. Briskets were really good other than that the meat/chicken was terrible.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I came here the other night because the wait at tofu hut was way too long and the service here was just completely terrible and there was only one other party next to us in the entire place. I mean the food and meat was okay but I asked for salad three times and they still never brought it by the time I was done eating. I also asked for rice and kimchi TWICE and when I would ask if it was coming they would roll their eyes (it never came anyway). Every time we asked for something they would write it down and say okay but then they would never come with it??? I think it ridiculous to have to ask for everything 2-3 times when it's not even busy. I'm never coming here again. It was a terrible experience.\n",

      "I'm quite pleased. Dumpling Restaurant has been on my bookmarked list for a number of years, and I've never gone. I'm a sucker for Korean food and a sucker for good steamed dumplings. I have no idea how they came up with a concept to serve both together, but if I can get both, I will do it. My brother wanted to go out for Asian food tonight, so we ended up coming here. At about 7-7:30pm on a weeknight, less than half the restaurant was filled up. There was also a few free spots in their very small parking lot. This works for me. So far, so good. \r\n",

      "Then comes the menu. It's one of those ones where you tick off what you want and then hand it back to the server. No pictures, but I'll survive. It's times like this I wish I knew how to read Chinese more so I could (hopefully) have a better idea of what some of the menu items are. It's not that the menu is particularly vague. It's just that sometimes, I'd like to know what kind of fish I'm ordering if I'm ordering spicy BBQ fish. I didn't end up getting my fish, but I probably will next time, and there will be a next time. We ordered, for the two of us, pork bone soup ($6.99), lamb skewers (8/$8.99), steamed pork and chive dumplings ($5.99), and pork and chive pot stickers (5/$4.99). \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lamb skewers were alright. Not the best I've ever had. On the dry side, but for the price, not terrible. I'd rather pay a little more and have them juicier though. I'll pass on these next time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The steamed pork and chive dumplings had thin wrappers (a plus in my books), and as my brother tried to take a picture of the dumpling he was holding up with his chopsticks, I just watched as juice poured out of it. Juicy dumplings. Also very reasonably priced. I can't remember whether it was 12 dumplings or 15 dumplings. Good stuff.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pork and chive pot stickers are the long dumplings. At $4.99, they're a good snack/light meal. Also super juicy. Bottoms were nice and crispy. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pork bone soup, while not quite the flavor I attribute to a Korean pork bone soup, was still tasty, and would satisfy a pork bone soup craving. The bones were very tender. It's a very sad day when you struggle getting the meat off your pork bones. For you soup lovers, there really isn't much soup in this bowl. There are a few veggies and a slice of potato, but this dish is very bone heavy. My brother had two bones, and I had a bit, but the rest of the bones we took to go. They were supposed to go into our small takeout boxes, but the bones were too big for the boxes, so they had to go into a large, rectangular box. They filled up that box. I can't remember if I put four or five bones in there. A minimum of six good-sized pork bones in pork bone soup. Definitely bang for your buck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Total damage was $30 and change AFTER tip, but before tax. We also had two boxes full of leftovers. There's lots more on the menu I wish I could have tried, but I'll need a return trip with more people to do so.\n",

The eggplant makes me come back time and time again and the prices are great too!  The Korean pork bone soup is also superb!  A few things that bring the rating down to 4 stars: the service is terrible and the atmosphere gives the impression that things aren't so clean.  Still love this place and visit it every time I'm back!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Some of the best dumplings I've ever had; hand made and delicious. The rest of their dishes are well priced, well made, but the dumplings here are the stars. One of the servers is terrible, another is great. Overall I'm quite a fan of this place and go here almost once a week.\n",

      "We took the seats by the window and wanted to order the Spicy BBQ Chicken with melted cheese and Soy Garlic Chicken and garlic fries. They mentioned they don't have garlic fries, so we decided to order the corn with cheese instead.  5 minutes pass by, one of the server came back to our table and told us they don't have the Spicy BBQ chicken with cheese. We then decided to order the green onion chicken but requested to add melted cheese, which they said they can't do that. We told them it's fine and we'll get the regular green onion with chicken. \r\n",
      "\r\n",

While half way done, we noticed we haven't received our order of Soy Garlic Chicken never came out. We asked the server if it was coming, to which they replied yes, it's on it's way. 10 more minutes pass by, we asked again and with a dumbfounded look on their face, they checked the kitchen and told us it was going to be ready soon. Another 5 minutes pass by and we never received it. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The food was good, but the service was just terrible. I would rate the food to be 4 stars, but due to the terrible service we received, in addition to the lack of the server checking up on us, and not having the food we wanted.. this place is not worth going to. \r\n",

I mean, the chicken tastes fine, but it has huge up and down, sometimes the sauce tastes too sweet, sometimes tastes good. and also the side dishes, you should know the importance of pickled radish when it comes to Korean fried chicken. most of times, it wasn't done properly meaning the radish needs to be picked longer before serving it.\r\n",

      "last couple times I went there. they ran out of draft beers. and it was around 6pm on friday(supposedly the busiest day of a week)  they must have a terrible manager who keeps on stocks. Never been to any restaurant that ran out of something before the weekend starts. and last time I tried to go again(I live in the annex) it was Saturday night, they ran out of sauce!! How can a korean chicken restaurant ran out of sauce?? that's by far the worst inventory management that i have experienced. I worked at various restaurants as kitchen manager, and I managed inventories. it's a major problem, that could badly damage the revenue of the restaurant. It has happened several times. I don't understand their management. whoever in charge of inventory need to be let go in order to serve better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2. Consistency\r\n",
      "As I mentioned earlier, this restaurant's consistency is really bad. Sometimes I feel like eating totally different food from different restaurant. Not only their inventory management sucks, but also their cooks don't know how to follow recipe, which is a simple task.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fry became the main brand of Korean chicken in Toronto, and they have to have certain management skills to continuously growing or serving proper service to costumers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I really hope the owner to see this review and consider changing their management for better service.\r\n",

Cost over $100 to get three small portions of chicken - and they included inedible chicken backs. Not the oysters - the spine, battered and fried. Butchery was terrible. Quantity terrible on everything, quality pretty bad too. The rice cakes were good, but the rest was a\n",

      "Very good korean bbq. We ordered a variety of meats. Unlimited lettuce & sides. The taste is very authentic to korea. My favourite was the boneless beef ribs. It is a la carte but the portions (200g) is quite filling especially with all the sides (unlimited) and different variety of meats you order. The food was delicious, we will definitely be returning. They lost two stars. One star lost because they messed up our order. We ordered pork skirt but got some random beef cut, didn't notice until after we started cooking since we ordered a lot of different types. The beef cut they gave us by accident (instead of the pork skirt) tasted like rubber when we cooked it. The second star lost because the service here is terrible. Everything took way too long to come in terms of asking for extra sides, as well as just having someone available to call to our table (it was very hard to get their attention). Other than customer service which needs a bit of tweaking, the food was delicious. They were all very nice, not rude or anything. They just need to be more readily available if we need them. It felt like they just came by our table once every 15 minutes. If this is not possible for them, maybe consider getting a button on call per table.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Secondly, if you come with 6 ppl, they will only give you a spot with one grill with very tight seating. There are a lot of sides so it gets really squishy and it is extremely difficult if you order something big like the pancake. I am not that big so my side of the table was OK, but if you are, you'll be very uncomfortable. I saw there were more tables near the washroom which is slightly more spatious- great if you get to sit there (try bringing 7 ppl instead of 6)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The meat quality was not very good. My boneless ribs were tough and very lean. I think the pork was OK but I was disappointed because of the price.\r\n",

      "Now onto the good things. Service was great. The waiter was really friendly and kept refilling. They accept credit card. Reservations is easy to make (I recommend this!). Love the atmosphere inside, it really feels like you're in Korea! The seafood pancake was also pretty good and decent priced.\r\n",

      "I am thoroughly confused by the majority of the positive reviews regarding Imonay. First off, to establish some street cred, I have lived in Korea and eat Korean food 1-2 times a week here in Toronto. I consider myself to be a connoisseur of kimchi and have a good understanding of what Korean food is supposed to taste like.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I came here with my group of friends after our two usual Koreatown haunts were packed to the brim and with lineups out the door. A quick search online showed that Imonay had good reviews and so we settled on it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had a kimchi jiggae (kimchi stew) and kimchi pajeon (kimchi pancake), as well as had my fair share of the standard banchan (side dishes) that accompany Korean meals. I had made a remark to my friends earlier in the meal regarding how I can usually tell how good the food is going to be based on the quality of their kimchi.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The kimchi was the least flavourful kimchi I have ever ever had in my life, full stop. I have encountered some places in Toronto with bad kimchi, but this place takes the cake. The kimchi did not taste properly fermented and was obviously very new kimchi that had not yet developed its flavour, which takes time. Even mediocre kimchi can be bought at local Korean grocery stores for dirt cheap, so I don't understand why we'd be served such terrible kimchi.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As such, the kimchi stew, which was made with similarly tasteless kimchi, had zero flavour. It appears that no salt was used in the stew, nor was their hot sauce very tasty either. The kimchi pancakes were only a tad better than the rest of the meal because of the small plate of salty soya sauce to dip it in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the end of the meal I was unsatisfied and asked for a refill of the side dishes, which is customary in Korean restaurants. Side dishes are bottomless and you never have to pay for refills. When I had requested more side dishes the server smiled in acknowledgement but did not bring them. When I asked a second time a few minutes later, she said okay and left. Upon returning a third time, she asked which side dishes I wanted refilled. When I said all of them, she said she could only do one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now I do not blame the waitress for this because it is obvious that she is only following the protocol set by the owners. A long time ago I went to Seoul House on Dufferin and Orfus and they too said that side dish refills weren't free and that we would have to pay for more. This is UNHEARD of in Korea and in 99% of Korean restaurants in Toronto. Only Seoul House and Imonay have done this, and I shame them for not being truly authentic Korean experiences in this sense. In Korea they would have been laughed at by their communities and be forced to shut due to such ridicule.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So in other words, the food was not good, the experience was not good and I will not be returning here. There are plenty of great restaurants in Koreatown and hopefully this place will one day be shut down to make room for better food and nicer experiences.\n",

      "I liked that their utensils had cute faces on them!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The order came out quickly by one of the two servers that was working there in the restaurant that night.  I felt bad for the two servers who had to constantly climb and walk down the single flight of stairs all night long to get the food.  Apparently their kitchen was on the second floor so every time they had to deliver the cooked food, they had to walk up and down the stairs to get the food to us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The topokki thankfully was quite good.  It was the right consistency of chewiness and tenderness.  The rice cakes' texture wasn't hard at all which can always be a deterrent when it comes to rice cakes.  There was an abundance of the ros챕 sauce so that all of the rice cakes were drenched in it.  This was a good thing though because when rice cakes are dry, they taste terrible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ros챕 sauce sauce was thick and quite spicy (and quite salty by itself).  While there were a lot of bacon in the dish, there were fewer onions, and even fewer broccoli and red peppers in the dish.  I would say that the broccoli and red peppers were practically non-existent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dish was topped with a meticulously scored plain hot dog sausage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It'll be interesting to see how Go Topoki fares in the upcoming months and years.  Their menu also includes snacks like popcorn chicken and fish cake skewers, rice and noodle options, and dessert like bingsu too.

      "Very clean and brightly lit place. Service was somewhat negligent but friendly - I had two girls helping me. One was texting on her phone for 5 minutes before she noticed I had no menu or wafer. I actually had to ask for water as I wasn't given any. Service did get better when her colleague stepped in. The second server was the opposite of the first server - very attentive and filled up my water every time it was half full. The first server came back around again by the time I was ready to pay. It actually took another customer to let her know that I was ready to pay. So...all in all, not terrible service but service as a whole needs to be more attentive. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food was pretty good. I got the seafood base rice cakes with ros챕 sauce and ramen noodles. It was very filling! I also ended up getting the veggie fritters and they were good as well. Since I was starving when I came in, I ended up finishing everything! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The restaurant also serves shaved ice, which is interesting, considering how it is usually dessert-type restaurants that serve shaved ice. Then again, Go Topoki specializes in serving customized rice cakes so the shaved ice for dessert shouldn't be something that is super surprising. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The worst offender has to be the brown sauce one. The sauce is very thin. Rice cake is pretty solid and tasteless. You need a thicker sauce to go with it. The sauce itself didn't taste good. Too salty. Just picture buying a bottle of soy sauce from super market, and putting some rice cakes in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The white sauce one is better but same complaint from me. Better if you make the sauce thicker. It's like I'm drinking soup with rice cakes.\r\n",

      "I agree with the previous reviewer that something terrible has happened to a restaurant that used to be good. When we arrived, nobody greeted us, so we just sat at a table and waited for about 5 or 10 minutes for anyone to come to the table. The server threw a menu onto the table and then came back in a few minutes and asked us what number we wanted. She then said that they were out of some things and said that we could order from the Appetizer or Soup sections (what, no entrees?). I asked if anything at all was available from the other sections and she pointed to a few things. When she brought our food, she did not bring my daughter's order, and she didn't bring a salad that we had ordered to share. We assumed she was coming back with those, but she never came back. She stayed in the back, talking on the phone. We shared our entrees with our daughter, since she didn't have anything to eat. When we were finished, she did not bring the check - my daughter and I finally got up and went outside, and only then did she bring the check to my husband. She didn't apologize for not bringing all our food. On top of everything else, I got very sick to my stomach the next day.\r\n",

I was a bit uneasy as I sat near enough to the kitchen to see that things here had changed. \r\n",

      "When i was near the kitchen before, i always caught glimpses of gleaming white floors and shiny aluminum... now, it looks dingy and disorganized. I tried to order my soup, and I'm not sure if they were out of the ingredients, or if it has been removed from the menu, but the result is the same. I didn't get any. \r\n",

      "So I had a hankering for some Korean food and didn't want to drive all the way down to North York and so decided to go to Nak Won in Richmond Hill.  We arrived and there was no wait as it is quite a big space.  We were asked if we wanted to bbq or just a regular table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As we had two young kids we decided to just do the regular table.  The menu is quite extensive offering traditional fare, Korean bbq and Cinese Korean cuisine.  We decided to order the soon dubu chigae, dolsot bibimbap, and the bulgogi dinner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were given 6 side dishes but in all honesty of the 6 side dishes only a few were good enough to eat.  While it's always nice to get more it's only good if you can eat it.  The kimchi was terrible and tasted bad.  The potatoes and fish cakes were pretty much the only side dishes that weren't a disaster.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The entrees arrived quite quickly.  The tofu hot pot was pretty good in terms of flavours and textures, but slightly on the bland side would have tasted much better with a little more kick to it.  All the ingredients were fresh so overall 3.5.  The dolsot bibimbap is pretty hard to mess up and tasted just as good as anywhere else so would give it a 4.  The bulgogi dinner was good but a bit on the fatty and chewy side.  It was marinated okay so overall 3.5.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, it was worth it to not have to drive to north York, but if I could would have given an overall of 3.5.  Definitely worth trying if you live in York region.\n",

      "This was my first time at Genghis Grill and it was a unique experience. The place is bigger than I thought it was. You can either go up to the counter and build your own bowl, have them make your custom bowl, or choose a classic bowl. We wanted to make our own, but first ordered both appetizers: Garlic-Citrus Edamame and Chicken Potstickers. I thought the edamame was a little too firm for my liking and the seasoning was ok, but not amazing. The potstickers were fine but they were almost room temperature and the dipping sauce was cold, which I didn't like. And our water tasted like dirt! I'm not even exaggerating. I took one sip and that was it. My boyfriend agreed it was terrible. The cups looked dirty too. We promptly ordered a Coke and an iced tea using the cool little electronic tablet on the table.\r\n",
      "After the appetizers, we went up to make our entrees. There were several people in the line. I got the sliced beef with garlic, salt, and pepper, carrots, and pineapple. When I got toward the end, I realized the noodles were separate and did not have to fit in the metal bowl, so I decided to go back to the start of the line to add more meat and veggies. I got more of the same, plus a few green beans, broccoli, and mandarin oranges. I also got the Island Teriyaki sauce, an egg, and selected the udon noodles. When I got back to the table to wait for the food to be delivered, I noticed they had taken our tablet away... I was disappointed cuz I thought we would actually be able to pay with it. Boo.\r\n",
      "My boyfriend's food came several minutes before mine since he didn't go back like I did. I think it confused the workers that our food wasn't together. But once I got mine, it was pretty tasty. The beef tasted like hamburger meat, which I wasn't expecting, but I like hamburger so that's alright with me. Since it's stir fry, the green beans and broccoli were crunchier than I prefer, but they still tasted good in the sauce. I also tried a bite of my boyfriend's dish. He had chicken and the 3G sauce. It didn't have a lot of flavor because he made the mistake of putting the sauce in the bowl rather than in a separate cup, so a lot of it burned off during cooking.\r\n",
      "But the regular size was a good amount of food and I was full. I wish they had the option of doing two mini-bowls so I could try two different sauces and one w/ rice, one w/ noodles. That would be cool. I don't know if I will be back to try something different. Our server was very attentive, but it wasn't a cheap meal, and with the mishaps we encountered, I'm just not sure if it's worth it to return.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The food was terrible and the service was really bad.  We were so disgusted to find a plastic package in the hot pot and we did not get any apology or discount. Our bill was $95.99 and we paid $100 out of courtesy. When we were leaving, the server lady came over to ask for extra tips (at least 10% of the total in her words).  It was just so ridiculous.\n",

She brought one out and my cousin asked for another box as she wanted to take the pork home since she didn't eat it and only drank the soup. I handed her my large box and asked the lady to just replace my box with a small one. She insisted to get a soup container for the pork but I explained that there is no soup we just want to take the meat. She rolled her eyes and went to the back and got me soup container anyways and the started to clear the table very rudely. I don't really know what I said to offend her so much but for that reason alone  I will not be returning because the food was not worth the terrible attitude. \r\n",

But mostly given a poor rating because I completely agree about the terrible attitude of some of the (older) waitresses. They do rude little gestures like slamming water cups down on the table, not speaking to you at all (accompanied by a stone face that looks very angry), and demanding a tip (i'm not joking) even if you order on the go (meaning stay less than 10 minutes).\n",

      "Korean Grill House is one of the earlier KBBQ in the area when there wasn't any choice to pick from. Now with Chako, Chingu, etc in the picture you can easily tell that Korean Grill House is not very good.  The meat quality is poor as most of the beef they give you is brownish already and the cut is so thin.  The short ribs are mostly fat than meat which is nasty. Service is terrible as well as they do not have enough staff and takes them a while before they get you what you want.  Also there is no veggie unless you upgrade for $3.99 more.  Servers aren't too happy if you ask them to change the grill more than once. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I pretty much tried a piece of every meat that they offered and none of it was anything I'd ever pay for. I honestly wouldn't even dine here for free next time. There are so many things wrong with this spot. The sides don't even look remotely fresh. They look like they've been sitting in the fridge for several days. They were all wilted and disgusting looking. The rice was hard and seemed like it was scooped into the bowl hours before we even got there. It was just hard, dry, and terrible. Arguably the worst bowl of rice I've ever had. Their salmon isn't that fresh. I guess it's hard to expect somewhat fresh fish at an AYCE KBBQ, but seriously just don't serve it at all if you aren't gonna get some decent stuff. I ate about a total of maybe 5 oz of meat or so and like 1/4th my bowl of rice before I threw in the towel. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Other things I found strange that I wasn't used to. They never change their grill. You cook your meal throughout on the same grill and it forms that nasty ass carcinogenic crust that is just not only bad for your health, but also leaves disgusting residue on your meat as you cook it. CHANGE THE GRILL, GODDAMNN. Another thing with the grill is that it dips in about 10 inches deep and it's just harder to cook because you have to stand up to look over to see all the meat that you're cooking. Also the grill is poorly designed in that you can actually burn your fingers while trying to cook because the flames come through. Never had this issue in Los Angeles. \r\n",

If I had one positive thing to say about Korea Grill House, it would be that the decor is nice. If you have no standards at all for food quality and don't mind paying good money for it, by all means make your way over. It also helps to enjoy the meal if you don't care about getting cancer.\n",

      "2. The restaurant is also very loud and hard to socialize.\r\n",
      "3. Maybe it's just me, but I also did not like how the grill was set lower, making it hard to cook on. Most of my time was spent standing up to even see the grill.\r\n",

There is a lot of delicious competition in Markham and Thornhill like Gyubee Japanese BBQ, Shinta Japanese BBQ and Gyu Hito and this one just wasn't good unfortunately. I really honestly feel sad to put 1 star, but I feel like it was a total waste to come here when competitors aren't even that much more expensive and quality of food and taste is MUCH higher at other locations.

We ended up getting the plates ourselves, which as a result we got educated on how we couldn't just grab our own plates. Afterwards, the lady was totally rude: ignored our orders, gave us dirty looks, laughed at us back in her station, etc. When we asked to change server, the manager had to PULL her back as if she wanted to go ape shit on us.

Also their menu says they charge a 15% gratuity for over 4 people. OVER 4 people, but even though there was only 4 of us they charged us 15%. I would have paid that if the service was decent, but since it was terrible I fought for it and said that it does not say 4 or more. The associate said they didn't know that the menu said that. I don't understand how some of the associates don't understand the meaning of OVER 4. I'm usually a great tipper.

We looked at the menu and when we ordered, we discovered that one of our menus had tape over some of the items to indicate they were no longer available. The BOGO free beer was a tease, no free desserts included & no green tea smoked pork belly. :( This is minor but they were out of Hite beer but they had Cass beer.

Looking at other photos from people who have went before me, I was disappointed to not get the some of my favorite banchan. In one of the photos, they received more banchan.

Where the amounts were varying - one contained rice to the brim while the other bowl looked as if half was scooped out. One of the items we ordered, the baby octopus, had an extremely small serving. I almost laughed when it was TWO pieces for one order, and only ONE order per person?

      "==========\n",
      "This place was a big disappointment. The bugulgi was excessively tough and cut too thick. We tried a few other cuts of meat and they were all chewy. The marinade was too salty. The side dishes were very sparse in selection and was all the cheap stuff. They also didn't turn on our exhaust fan over the barbecue and I had to ask them twice to turn it on . The service was also terrible and when we complained about the meat quality they insisted I didn't know what I was talking about even i explained how often I go to Korean barbecue restaurants all over Vegas, New York and LA. \r\n",

      "Definitely will not be back.\n",

      "I have never been to this place and this is my first time and the service is horrendous! We are a big group and they put us on their list. So we kept waiting and waiting. We were waiting inside almost an hour when all of a sudden the host  told us to go wait outside instead. There were people that got there after us that were waiting also, but for some reason we were the only once singled out to do so. We then asked how long til we get seated and the guy says we can only sit you on separate tables. Are you kidding me? They  pretended that they will accommodate us only to say that they really don't have a table for all of us because the long tables are reserved. Over the phone they said they don't take reservations. The staff were very rude and customer service is terrible. If they would have told us the minute we got there that they cannot accommodate us we would not have stood around for an hour for nothing. We will never go back to this place and I have no intention of trying the food either.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The service was terrible. There was a party of 6 with me and a baby. They put us on a corner table, where it was so small we were literally elbow to elbow. We asked to be moved and the manager kept telling us no. There was a table with a party of 4 and the manager lied and told us that they were 2 different parties but they were all eating off the same grill. So we dealt with it cause we were very hungry. The whole time I was eating I was standing and the manager obviously so that and did not offer to give me a stool or anything. Our server wanted to help but the manager kept rejecting her and us. On top of letting me stand on my table because there was no space. The manager did not offer any discount for the inconvenience and wanted to argue. The food was ok, but the way the manager treated us was so terrible, I really wanted to cuss him out. I will never go to this place again and I will tell all my friends not to go to this place. There are so many other Korean BBQ that has better food and definitely better service who don't let their customers stand!!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This place is terrible! We went in and they stick is in a booth at the back. It was unbearably hot and stuffy. I looked at the thermostat and it said 89 degrees! That is not acceptable. We told everyone who came to the table that we need to move and they need to turn the ac up. The waiter tells me that its hot because we there are many grills on. That's straight bs! We demanded to be moved and the next table was a bit more cooler than the first. I was too hungry and wasn't leaving til I ate, Hoping the food would make up for it. After we changed tables the service was horrible. I will never go back to that dump!\n",

      "Can't go wrong here. Don't expect gourmet style AYCE Korean BBQ. They have all the basic meats. Service is slow, not terrible. You get plenty of Korean side dishes, a one time miniature Korean soybean soup and steamed eggs. when I crave BBQ, this is the only place in Vegas I go to.\n",

      "This is our third time eating here at hwaro the 1st and 2nd experience were great not until we came here today there's something wrong with the smell of the meat that they serve us I called their attention they said that's how its made here,  I told the server that this is not our 1st time eating here so I know what I'm talking about I ask them if they can replace this meat that they serve us and the server said I cannot, we decided to just leave bcoz of unwelcoming poor customer service. We will never come back here again...the Korean guy server with a medium built body atleast 5'7 in height is the one with such super terrible attitude so watch out..\n",

Mind you in Asia they usually sit the Gaijin in the back which I have experienced many times and being brown with my friend whos quite a bit darker we joked about it. Appetizers were on the table when we arrived but the kimchee was terrible. It was by far the WORST kimchee I have ever had. It was dry and looked old. Mind you, Ive eaten a lot of KBBQ stateside and in Korea. and this was definitely low place on the totem pole. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They then brought the appetizers, the shit (fried crab with may drizzle, gross), egg rolls (basic/average), Gyoza (basic/average), korean fried chicken which was topped with a HEAVILY mayo based honey mustard. It absolutely ruined the chicken. I was excited to try the bulgogi nachos and it was terrible. Tons of mayo sauce, no cheese, and barely any meat. \r\n",

      "And after 50 minutes wait the host escorts us to booth small as 4 people can seat. I asked him can we go to bigger tables ( was that time big and large table empty. No one seat there) he told me big table for large groups. So we ask couples of chair to fit on. Was very small space and difficult to cook and eat. Also they put the meat on the looks like cutting board  the blood from meat spills on table and waiter put dish to top of board.\r\n",
      "Very disappointed and contaminating this is healthy issues. I can't believe it . We asked sanitation tissues to clean the table but waiter bring towels to clean top of table OMG!!!\r\n",

      "Service was appalling. I dined here last night with my friend after work, $20 ayce is a great deal for the limited variety of meat selection provided to satisfy your KBBQ cravings. We were seated at a nice booth at around midnight. Started off with the ribeye, beef belly, and green tea pork belly along with a few side orders-- my friend loved 'The Shit' which was a deep fried crab meat roll appetizer. All of our side orders came out correctly, however we had the wrong meat orders sent to our tables 4 times throughout the entire time (we only ordered one round of meat btw). We ended just settling for the wrong meat orders that we were given because we were starving and didn't want to bother dealing with it. We ordered three different varieties of meat, but we received 6 and only received 2 of the 3 correct orders. I feel bad for the other parties who were waiting for their orders that ended up on our table. \r\n",
      "Our server was kind enough to cook the meat for us, but was not very attentive with our grill-- leaving our meats almost burnt. We had 3 fully cooked meat varieties on our grill, and for some reason, she thought it was a good idea to add more meat to cook although we were still working on the current ones. Once all of the meats cooked, she turned off our grill (which I was fine with because our meats were burning) and we were eventually left with cold meats throughout our dining experience. There is obviously a strong lack of communication within their service staff. I thought it was odd that they did not have a brisket sauce as well (like most KBBQ establishments) with only sesame oil and bean paste available.\r\n",
      "I've worked at a KBBQ restaurant previously for two years in LA and I've dined at many KBBQ restaurants in Southern California-- service here was terrible. Service aside, the only good thing I can say about this place is that they are open really late and their sides (The Shit and seafood salad) were good. The meats are not the highest quality (probably Select grade), but you get what you pay for.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "the food is ok, but nothing special, my guests did not like it at all, it was not comfortable to be in this place, terrible music, loud and obsessive that it was impossible to talk, we were 5 people, two of us even did not eat at all and they were also charged for them, plus it is not clear why we were refused to take food with us what we already prepared, but did not eat it, it was not so much ... they said that they have like some policy... why no where is it written about these rules ?!  we were very unhappy, we paid $ 165 for two salads, chicken and a few small portions of meat, I think it is too expensive for an place of this level!  I do not recommend to visit\n",

      "Short rib soup was bland. Barely any flavour. You would have better flavour using packaged broth. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The mungbean cake was pretty terrible too. It was soft and the texture came out way too brittle. It ended up tasting like Korean pancake with filler. The mungbean didn't give it a better taste but definitely a weird texture. It was 15.99 or something like that which is way too much for essentially a thick Korean pancake. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This is not some modern vibe or hip place on Ossington.  It's an honest spot with handcrafted dishes.  The place is sparse but clean.  There's two rooms ... one in the back is smaller and more private and the larger front space with a number of big tables and tables for 4.  It's well spaced out so you're never feeling claustrophobic.  There's no noticeable loud music so it's a pretty calming place.  If there is a loud table, you're going to hear them... you're never really far from them.  I wouldn't necessarily call this place as much as spartan.  There's no discernible decorations but a clean bright space is always appreciated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did like how when I first walked in, you smelled the beef cooking and the smells of the Korean pork dumplings.  It's such a great smell.  I also saw at least 3 'Aunties' sitting at the table and just folding the dumplings.  If this isn't a sign of great food to come, I dont know what it would be.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",

We were given 4 in total .. spicy savage kimchi, matchsticks potato, sesame bean sprouts, and a daikon seas weed salad.  The Kimchi was the most vibrant and flavourful ... 4/5 for that. Everytjing else is 3.5/5\r\n",

      "Soon Tofu soup with seafood - It came in the heated bowl and it was just bubbling away for a while as it cooked in front of me.  The freshly cracked egg made it a richer stew and there was a lot of soft tofu and calamari.  This definitely was medium spiced.  I loved it but I wouldn't recommend it to a new person trying! 4/5\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bibimbap with seafood - comfort food at its finest with a lot of finely diced vegetables to mix in with the rice, seafood, and hot sauce.  I think there could have been a bit more seafood but it was a nice dish 3.5/5\r\n",

The complementary seafood pancake has turned into a cold, tough, regular pancake with no flavor and no seafood. The sides are still ok. The soondubu is terrible, it wasn't fresh at all and it had a weird mouthfeel, and was underseasoned. The prices went up and the portions are smaller. Heard they changed owners... figures... won't be back.\n",

It's funny to say that but this korean restaurant is Not a restaurant for Korean customer(would not recommend to my friends!)\n",

      "The food here was pretty good, but service was terrible. The waitress Cindy must've had a bad day judging by her dry attitude and lack of enthusiasm at her job. Also, I didn't like that we couldn't cook our own food and the waitress had to do it for us at our table. I prefer other restaurant's with similar style, but allowing the customers to cook their own food at the table. \r\n",

After sitting for a few minutes while waiting for the food to arrive, I had to tell her I wanted a drink and she brought it to me. Cindy did not ask if anyone else wanted a drink other than water and continued to ignore our table, only to cook the food for consumption. \r\n",

      "We think that she really hates her job or was ready to go home or since we were a party of 7, she would automatically receive a decent tip, so it was not necessary to actually do a great job... or probably all of the above. Cindy's attitude was disappointing and terrible. She had no personality. If you want a great dining experience with good treatment and exceptional customer service, don't dine at Sizzle Korean Barbecue. Instead, choose one of the many other options available in the Desert Ridge Marketplace.\n",

When I got back home,take out the food, the stew looks like left-over from someone else. It only covered 1/3 of the the box. Even worse, there's no beef at all!!! There were very tiny and not fresh shrimps instead. More importantly, it even didn't taste good. The rice was only a bite!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This is my third time coming since it opened two years ago. The first time I came was when the place first opened, and I was a little disappointed with the food and service. I attributed it to the fact that the restaurant was newly opened. The second time I came was a year later, thinking the restaurant might have become more stable. I was wrong. The food was okay, but the service was terrible. My friend and I waited for thirty minutes to order, the small dishes were not fresh that night, and we waited another hour for our food to arrive. I told myself I would never come here again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A year later (now), I came again because my friends wanted to go. I thought, one last try. This time, I got the Golbi Tong ($16.99), which is really similar to Chinese daikon soup! The taste of the food is good, and the portion size of the Golbi Tong is large because it is soup based. The meat wasn't completely cut into slices and was still held together though. The beef should also have been cooked in the broth longer for it to have softened more. But on food otherwise, it was decent. The small eats this time were fresh and well marinated, quite unlike my experience previously. The service is still a little slow, but the lady is also a little more friendly than I remembered her to be. It's good to see improvement. I might just come here again in the near future.\n",

The jotbal was terrible, it was the quality of what you get at a supermarket. The bulgogi was $12 but portion was so small and quality was not good. The budaejigae was okay because you cannot go wrong with that. The service was very bad. I asked for tea 2 times and still had to wait to be served. I was very thirsty. The 2 male servers were not even that busy. They did not even ask if we need anything or check up on us. Very dissapointed and do not recommended this place other than their lunch special. I guess if you go late night when you are intoxicated then it is ok.\n",

Everything says they're open until 10:00pm, but when we got there at 8:45 we were told that we had to order before 9:00pm because the chef leaves at 9:00.  So, why don't you state that you close at 9pm?  Banchan was old and stale and only received 3 dishes when we normally receive much more.  Asked for water 3 times and never received any.  Asked for Bori Cha and we were told that they didn't have any.  Terrible service.  Food tasted terrible tonight.  We are normally treated very well at this restaurant and the food is usually delicious, but we didn't even receive a goodbye or thank you from the owner when we left.  If this is how you treat people who drive from Columbus for your food, then we will find another restaurant who appreciates the business.   If you're irritated that people come in so close to closing time, then you should advertise that you close at 9pm and not 10pm.  If you're looking for good Korean food with friendly service, go ANYWHERE but Miega.\n",

With only one other Korean restaurant in NYC I tried that I can compare this one to, I was moderately pleased with the food and service. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The servers were efficient taking orders, but they could be a little more attentive with follow up and explaining options.  No dessert was offered, so I don't know if they even have any.  Don't expect the professionalism you'd find in finer establishments. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food was mostly tasty, but often overcooked. I tasted someone's breaded and fried pork and found the breading too thick and the meat chewy.  I had the dol sot bi bim bob, which I had in NYC previously.  I loved it in NY, but here it's pretty dull and short on flavor, and the meat is meager. This was the opinion of others in my party who had this dish. Even before the meat was burned and stuck to the bowl, it was overcooked.  I also tried the octopus, some of which was tender, but some was so chewy as to be almost inedible. The green tea was terrible too, smelling and tasting like rice that had started to go bad.  I'm told someone's terriyaki dish was quite good.\r\n",

      "Most Korean places in Cleveland are subpar. This one was no exception. I went with a friend and we ordered bibimbap, bulgogi, and mandu soup. The bibimbap was good but nothing special that you couldn't get at any other Korean restaurant in the area or make it yourself. The bulgogi was terrible. I am not sure if they were out of meat that day or think non-Koreans can't tell the difference between real beef and CHICKEN LIVER because that's what it tasted like. I have eaten a lot of bulgogi and know that it's not supposed to taste like cat food mixed with marinated cardboard with Korean seasoning. I am not exactly sure what I ate but it was definitely not beef. However, The Mandu soup was the best part of the meal as it was bursting with flavorful and the mandu were delicious and the reason I am not giving this place a 1 star.\n",

      "I went to this place 3rd times. The second one was on March, the food was great (I didn't order BBQ), the service was good and big portion. But on my third visited I feel very disappointed. Went there for BBQ dinner with my husband for the first time. The service was terrible, the food was not something that we expected and they didn't serve garlic (we need to pay extra for garlic slices). \r\n",

The waiters need to follow up on the tables for any water or banchan refills instead of just serving the food & moving on to new orders. Takamatsu in chandler has better quality  food & the best service since the manager is on the floor directing the employees.  Chodang is also better in food quality but the service can be slow at times but its not as bad as it is at hodori.\n",
      "==========\n",

      "==========\n",
      "The bulgogi was terribly fatty, however the portions were bigger.  I rather have quality over quantity, so I wasn't a fan.  The kalbi was more pleasing and the flavor was okay.  The banchan were fairly standard, nothing mind blowing.  The best gauge is usually the kimchi and taste if their homemade recipe is as superior as other restaurants.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With two soon dobu one spicy and the other mild, the soup came out white.  When asked about the mild spice, the chef says the spice is there.  I couldn't taste or smell a hint of spiciness in that soup.  If you have white, mild, spicy and extra spicy, I would imagine the mild has some type of spice and color to the soup base.    \r\n",

I also discovered my love for Kimchi Chigae, which I thought is a simple dish of soup.  I tried looking for the recipe and duplicate it but failed every time.

It's a cramped space with barely any air circulation, so be prepared to sweat. The menu items were completely mediocre, ranging from sickeningly sweet to bland.

      "Again the service was extremely slow. However, it was a BIT busier than the last time, but i expect better service. The waiter gave us zero time to look over the menu and then when we were ready it seemed like he never came back. Waters never got refilled. just terrible.\r\n",

The server barely said two words to us and was nowhere to be seen if he wasn't delivering food.  No asking if everything was okay, if we wanted more rice,  another drink, etc.  Our bill was incorrect and we got another server to correct it.  I don't know if it wasn't a regular server and just someone filling in, but it was so strange to be so negliected by a server.\n",

My friend replied politely in Korean that we did not in fact order it and said we even pointed to the picture on the wall saying we wanted this dish. She grumbles, yells at the waitress and storms off. At this point we have already waited 40 mins for our main.

      "When we walked in we were informed it would be about a 20 minute wait so we asked if we could head to the bar, which we did. We had a difficult time choosing a drink because they were out of everything we wanted! They didn't have Kirin and the only local beer was Four Peaks Kiltlifter. We asked for their featured drink (something Martinez) and the bartender informed us they have never been able to make it and he didn't know why it was on the menu. The condition of the bar was atrocious as well. Boxes of beer stacked in plain view in the bar, most of them damaged because of a wet floor. Dirty glasses and coffee cups on the bar. AND the liquours all had saran wrap around the spouts, implying they have an issue with fruit flies. We decided to continue with the lunch because we know they are new and we wanted to try it and give them the benefit of the doubt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After about five minutes, we received a text notification that the table was ready. We grab our drinks and walk to the front, where the hostess politely informs us the table isn't actually ready. So we walk back to the bar, drinks still in our hands and sit down again. The hostess is there almost instantly to say our table is ready. A lot of back and forth for nothing; they need to get organized!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We sit down and tell our waitress (when she asks) it's our first time. We were informed we had to order the dinner menu (at dinner price) and that any left over food would constitute an additional $5/plate upcharge!!!! She also told us we could only order 4 items at a time. All of this information is important, but we still didn't know how to eat a Korean BBQ and we received NO instruction! We asked a couple other people who worked there, and they all seemed clueless and unable to provide instruction. The food was amazing. The marinades and meats were amazing; if you love meat, you need to try Korean BBQ (just not here!) No one explained the sides or how to compliment the meats with them, so we felt like we missed out on the full experience. We also received no instruction on how long to cook the meats or seafood which seemed odd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lastly, the worst experience of them all came when we paid. For two of us, it was a $75 tab. My friend put down half in cash, I was paying the other half on my card. Suddenly, my card was charged $190!!!!!! After finally flagging someone down after a good 5 minutes to say I wanted to talk to someone about the charge, the waitress comes over to confirm that my card was mischarged, the manager was fixing it and that she would be by in a minute. She still did not come by after several minutes so I went to her at the front cash register. She had several receipts and it was very obvious there was confusion on how to fix the error. She did not speak to me at all, she let her hostess at her side do the talking. The hostess said they had credited my card $190-$38 which was approximately $152 and then they handed me $38 cash and were about to swipe my card for the entire tab of $75!!!! At this point, I said no way and took my card back and said they shouldn't have handed me the $38 cash and that it was theirs to cover my bill. Now, they said I owed them an additional $3 (I'm not sure how and I should have asked at the time) but I was so unwilling to hand my card back, that my friend dug in her purse for the money. At this point, I was frank with them and said that I thought it was BS that they charged my card incorrectly, did a poor job fixing it and then were being petty over the $3!!!!! She didn't apologize, she didn't say I was right, she didn't backtrack on the request. Her manager never looked at me or spoke to me or apologized. No one tried to fix this!!!!!! We walked away very upset.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I called my bank yesterday when I didn't see any changes in the charge. My bank confirmed that at the very least, they should see some activity on their end of a debit/credit and there was none so I had to dispute the charge to make sure I get my money back.  If you decide to go, you'll have a wonderful meal but hopefully you'll know how to cook it and get the full benefit of the meal and cooking. Take cash!!!!!!!!!!!\n",

      "It was awesome!!  A bit on the pricey side BUT you definitely get what you pay for!  The only thing bad about the place is that the water is terrible.  It is not really their fault.  Tempe water in general is very bad.  They could get some kind of filtration system I guess, but it is still not worth knocking them down a star.  We went for Sunday lunch and had to wait about 50 minutes to get seated because they were so busy.  They were up front about it though, which is why I still give them 5 stars.  Also, on the weekends, it is about $25 per person because the lunch menu is only during the week for about $17.  Overall it is really good and you don't feel rushed or anything.\n",

Our first server was rude and I told him that I've been to this restaurant back home in California but he made it sound like they were totally different, which confused me. Then the first server had to clock out, our second server came and took our second order and then the food took too long that we told two other servers we were just waiting on the food then they brought us the food, then after receiving that food, they brought our same order but there was a confusion, they ordered our food twice which we didn't do at all and then they messed up our order. Then our fourth server came and he was nice, he kept on checking up on us to see if our food was ready, besides everyone else, then we were finished with our food and then there was another server that came and we told him that we were ready for our check. We paid with cash and card between three people, and we told the waiter that the cash is for the two people and the rest is on the card, our waiter asked if we wanted change and we said no. They bring us back the check and they charged my friend more on her card and thought we were splitting the cost which we already explained to him. Then we talk to the manager, she heard our complaint, but did not do anything to appeal to our problem, she did not offer any discount for the terrible service we received that night, she just told us sorry and also she hopes to see us again.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Would have given 5 stars if my girlfriend and I had been seated once our buzzer went off. Rather we were kept waiting for an additional 20+ minutes which I feel is bad for business. As far as the food is concerned, I'll rate that at 5 stars. The service itself was terrible though. We actually had to grab another waiter other than our own to assist us with the grill because ours neglected us for the majority of our time until the bill was delivered.\n",

There were a few Korean BBQ places that sold a la carte meat dishes but you end up spending like $70 or more for two people.

Three hostess kept coming by to make sure we had what we needed, and if we didn't, they would get David for us. And two other staff came to change our grill plates very often. And if they didn't come, one of the hostess that kept coming to our table got someone to change our grill plate. David and the hostesses came by so often we had trouble keeping up with ordering our food because our orders kept coming fast. That's what I called EXCELLENT SERVICE.\r\n",

      "The food was so delicious. We were able to order about 17 items within the 2 hour limit we had. I highly recommend the bulgogi and Hawaiian pork belly and beef tongue. I personally felt the the meat quality for all items ordered was very good. You can tell by the color and the texture of the meats. The marinated flavored meats were excellent. It blew me away because it tasted really good~! Even compared to KBBQ places in LA, I thought this Gen location surpassed them in service, flavor, variety and quality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I don't know if they overstaffed themselves for the soft open, but this was one of the best Korean BBQ experiences I had. I hope they keep their staffing level like this for the future. The place was clean, the staff was great (friendly and fast), and the food was high quality with delicious flavors. If anything, I would suggest they put steamed egg on their menu, since I usually order that when I go to AYCE KBBQ, and they can improve their side dishes by making them bigger. BUT THE SIDE DISHES DIDN'T MATTER! Because our meats came out so fast and kept coming, I didn't have time to even really eat the sides dishes. LOL. Well played, Gen KBBQ. Well played.\n",

We were completely ignored by our server. I asked for soy sauce on 3 different occasions to my server. As I watched him service the tables next to us multiple times. I still never received my soy sauce from him. He never came to change out our grill so we could make our other food. We had to ask one of the busboys to change it out which he did with no problem. Finally when our server did come to the table we expressed why we were upset telling him all our rice and all the other food was now cold while waiting for sauce. He tells me no the rice isn't cold it still feels hot to him. I work in the customer service industry myself and this service was completely unacceptable. Not to mention I made a special trip all the way from Buckeye for this terrible service.\n",

      "We had tried several times to eat here but every time the wait was 2 hours long so imagine our excitement when we were told it was a 20 minute wait. However we were truly disappointed from the moment we sat down and if I could give it 0 stars I would. Our party was 3 people and as soon as we sat down we noticed the table was dirty, the plates were dirty, the grill was dirty. It looked like they just wiped down the table. We sat there for about 15 minutes before anyone came up to ask if we wanted any drinks or if we were ready to order. We ended up having two different waiters,  the second waitress claimed to not know our table was hers. After we asked for a clean grill and plates neither one ever showed back up to our table again after that. We had to get the attention of ANYONE who would walk by for service. We had to ask the busboy for more rice, who came back faster than anyone else. We even asked one of the managers for more food. At one point one of the hostess came over when she noticed us looking around for anyone and when we told her everything she said she would let her manager know. The manager later came over to our table and let us know that someone had called out for a family emergency and so the staff was confused over their sections. However while I completely understand this situation it does not excuse the dirty table before we even sat down when so many busboys were just walking around. Does not excuse the fact that we had to hunt down the staff for service. Hope their communication improves and it doesn't happen to anyone else because it was terrible.\n",

We ran into this place and are so glad we did. This place was delicious! We had soo many meats to choose from. We got a quick orientation from our waitress and had a go at it. The place is SUPER clean. Everything was really good, the only not spectacular one was the shrimp. Not my jam.\n",

We were then never spoken to during our meal except to see if they could take our sauces away.  Dirty dishes were left on our table thru the meal. Staff was more interested in filling sauces, and condiments then giving service to the customers.  You can the best Food but if service is bad you will continue to lose customer like us who used to come frequently.\n",

      "They cannot substitute for anything. Which means they must cook their food from Walmart since they do not make it fresh.  That is the only reason to not just take some veggies out. They were rude and short about a simple request.  If a restaurant cannot cater to their customers small request they might as well be the freezer section of Walmart.  Food was ok but not worth the price. Service was slow and terrible.\n",

      "I arrived at eleven just as the place was opening. There was a line of people to get in, which was reassuring. The fact that I think I was the only caucasian person was also reassuring. The server/host was friendly, though maybe a little overworked. I ordered the vegetables with garlic sauce and was left unimpressed. I paid 8 dollars for what seemed to be simply a plate of slightly steamed vegetables with a tad bit of sauce. Nothing terrible about my dish, but I think next time I patronize Saigon Noodles I will order something that's not on the last page of the menu. :)\n",

I was then told by a friend who had been here before that their kimchi is not authentic at all, and would be a disappointment, so I decided to forego it. The food itself took a really long time to arrive, with the first main arriving close to fifteen minutes before the last. I found the starter (sadly I forgot the name, it looks like a deep fried pancake folded in half over some filling) and my main (bulgogi chicken with veg and rice in a hot stone bowl) generally bland and even a tad sickening in taste. The only redeeming quality of the main was the meat, which was delicious, but scarce. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the beef bulgogi and beer marinated beef that we could grill ourselves. They were absolutely delicious, but too felt like very little meat for £6+ per plate.\n",

      "As another review points out, the service is terrible. The waiting staff pay no attention to what goes around them (we had to raise our voice to borderline shouting in order to get their attention from a meter away), the two waitresses seem very timid and even scared. Another lady, who appears to be their manager, has a very hostile air about her, made no effort to seem welcoming when talking to us and berated the two girls in the plain view of customers. When they do appear, the waitresses would come to the table, take the utensils and stir the meat on the grill after seeing you do it, before walking off without a word? Empty plates were not taken away from the table through the meal and once again the staff had to be almost shouted to in order to tell them that we would like our bill.\n",

      "Overall, I wasn't very impressed with the restaurant apart from the novelty of the grill, which I did enjoy. As far as I understand the food isn't very authentic, and isn't a great representation of quality of Korean food. The service is poor and I felt like I overpaid for the little food that I did eat. I told my friends I stopped eating because I had enough and wasn't hungry any more, whichever as true enough, but the cause of that was a lack of appetite, and not a full stomach. The only reason I can see myself coming back to Miss Korea is for the grill meats, and exclusively that.\n",

The service was especially bad and the food was off. Because we own a business nearby we thought enough time had passed that we thought we’d give it another try. I’m so glad that we did. The seafood and Kimchi pancakes were the best we’ve ever eaten. And we’ve travelled to Korea! The crust was crispy and the toppings were generous. The banchans were fresh and tasty, and the meats that we grilled at our table were beautiful. I highly recommend the spicy squid or baby octopus, and the beef tongue was incredibly tender. The service was also excellent. The manager, Aaron, visits each table insuring an enjoyable experience. We won’t be eating at our old favorites in Austin anymore, there’s just no comparison. My only disappointment is that the restaurant doesn’t serve Pa Muchim, the scallion salad that we’ve enjoyed at every other Korean restaurant we’ve ever eaten at. It’s especially good when served with the grilled meats. Aaron, maybe you should think about adding this to your menu. It won’t keep us from coming back, but it would be a lovely addition.\n",

Absolutely terrible. What did they do to it!? We were so sad. It was then we started to really notice the atmosphere. It felt like we were eating inside a laundromat, and it was completely filthy. Really nasty, things were broken, poorly arranged, service was awful, and the entire staff had a bad attitude. We won't go back. So disappointed. We just want our crappy back of the crowded dirty Korean market kim bop back.\n",

Banchan, the traditional little apps shared by all at the table, were likewise not great, but also not terrible.

I used the chili sauce from the complimentary appetizers to pour over the tofu since it was served plain. Delicious! Also ordered a small bottle of their raspberry wine. This is super sweet so keep that in mind. Now, for the service. The hostess was very polite and answered a couple of questions for me. Food was brought out with no explanation of what it was but since I saw other tables receiving the same appetizers/condiments I assumed it was the norm. As I ate (alone) I chatted with another single sitting beside me who had also arrived for a solo lunch. Before I was done, the check was dropped off. No big deal, this happens everywhere. But, she didn't ask me if I wanted anything else or if everything was alright. She then proceeded to walk over to the other gentleman's table and start CUTTING UP HIS FOOD FOR HIM AND MIXING IT!!!??? WTH?? He was dumbstruck at what she was doing. She then walked by again and shoved the bill closer to me. I flagged another waiter and asked for a to-go box for the uneaten portion of my food. As he went off, I sipped my wine and laughed with the other customer over the woman's odd behavior. She returned to my table and informed me to pay because \"We need table\". Screw you hag! I still had my lunch in front of me as well as my wine, all of which came to $41, not cheap. I'll leave when I'm damn well ready. Expect to be shoved in/out like cattle, it's the price to pay for a delicious authentic meal.\n",

      "Kun Jip somehow gets by with offering appalling service and poor food to the people in New York. They would not last a month in Seoul! (I lived there for over three years until the end of 2008). We went there as a party of 5 on Friday 7 April 2011..\n",

      "Although we had a reservation and arrived just a few minutes before the booked time we were made to stand in a queue in the drizzling rain but were eventually allowed inside. On being shown to our table - banquette on one side, three chairs on the other, one of the staff repeatedly bossed my wife to sit on the banquette. That was resolved by my wife using her formidable ex-schoolteacher tone of voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service continued in that vein. We ordered panjun as a starter before the barbecue; panjun arrived and was served to us in pizza like slices (sectors) rather than being cut into rectangles for us to take as we wanted. That was done in such a way that there was no pause before the first items of barbecue was served.\n",
      "\n",
      "The so-called barbecue was rather frying on a hotplate over a gas flame, so not the real thing, no radiant heat. no sizzling of meat juices etc. Cooked by a staff member, not allowing patrons to cook as is the case in proper Korean barbecue joints. Some of the sides were OK but were not topped up as they would be in other Korean restaurants I've eaten in, not just in Korea but also in Australia and the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pace finally slowed after we got our second bottle of Soju (only two of us drinking) but we had to finish that because all the food had been so quickly foisted upon as and had to be eaten while it was hot.\n",

Our below expectation experience started when the restaurant was supposed to open by 3:00 pm and didn't until 5:00. We spent the day in Ashville and wanted to eat an early dinner, so we had to wait.\n",

      "The dumplings were very good, fried better than steamed. We ordered beef, chicken and pork bul go gi and spare ribs. The spare ribs were not very good. The best was the chicken and pork.

      "1. We showed up when the place was empty, tables around the windows were reserved but one big long table in the middle was not and empty, so why did they sit the 3 of us right by the kitchen where we spent 2 hrs listening to kitchen banging and staff chatting is unclear.\n",
      "2. The cod was terrible, definitely not grilled, and bathing in oil. The “prawn” risotto also not great, and the “prawn” were just sad little shrimps also bathing in oil.\n",
      "3. Not a big deal for me because my kids eat everything, but they have no child friendly options.\n",
      "4. By far the worse thing, they bring stale bread to the table without mentioning that they will charge you 2 euros per person! Seriously per person, at least bring some nice freshly baked bread !\n",

      "Personal dislikes:\n",
      "- The atmosphere in the restaurant was bizarre, we ordered our food and it took more than 30 minutes for it to arrive. People sitting beside us had time time to enter the restaurant 10 minutes after us, sit down, order their meal, finish it and exit the restaurant before we got our main dish served to us ( which was pasta )\n",
      "- 2 different waiters interacted with us. It was confusing who was in charge of our table and therefore who to award the tip to ( if any ).\n",
      "- The restaurant tries to make themselves feel “elite” and generally high class even if it is far from it, I am 18 and they made it very difficult to get ahold of a table even after reserving ( don’t recommend the restaurant to anyone who is fairly young )\n",
      "\n",
      "General dislikes ( in specific the food )\n",
      "- We ordered pasta, I forgot what dish but it doesn’t really matter, there are only a few pasta dishes in the menu , all revolved around fish thus we figured it was a pretty safe bet - it wasn’t. The food as I said came extremely late and it was, to be quite honest, terrible. The pasta was heavily overcooked and almost felt as if it was pre-made then simply heated. I say this as the dish came out steaming hot, and we had to wait 3 minutes for it to be bearable to consume.\n",
      "- The dishes themselves had confusing and rather unpleasant flavors which did not work well with one another, I ordered crab fettuccini and the dish came with shrimp ( which was not specified in the menu ), and the only crab in the dish was blended into the sauce, resulting in a horrific, pasty concoction.\n",
      "- Me and my girlfriend both left our meals virtually untouched, and when I asked to speak with the manager he seemed rather offended, not very apologetic and simply shrugged at my criticism\n",
      "\n",
      "This was an uncomfortable and unpleasant experience and I do not recommend anyone to eat at this misleadingly “fancy” restaurant, especially pasta lovers like myself.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "First of all - you will be charged 13 euros for BREAD that they will automatically bring to your table without you asking and you won’t realize til you get the bill. We came with our baby and they did have a baby chair but they sat us in the window where my husband and I baked in the sun for half our meal before the sun set. Ordered the tapas size clams - SALTY! My son spit it out, I don’t blame him. Ordered pesto with prawns and the sauce was chunky with nuts. Ordered seaman’s risotto and it was the worst iteration I’ve had here after a wonderful 2 wk vacation. The risotto rice was underdone and chalky, despite that it was swimming in broth. Besides the food being AWFUL, the service was poor with waitstaff never checking on us (I have a baby, obviously I need napkins), the bathrooms were messy despite it being in a hotel (would think they would have staff for upkeep), and the whole terrible experience cost us 47 euros. I wanted to warn people browsing the menu outside to turn around and not eat here.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We ate here twice because we were staying at the hotel. The food is very good,the service can be outstanding to terrible from our experience. Depending on who you get.\n",
      "We ordered the codfish taco app,it came as breaded cod on mashed potatoes with onions. It wasn't a taco but it was delicious.A nice surprise. Nice wines and deserts. Very comfortable place both the bar and the restaurant.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We were very disappointed with this restaurant. Starting off the place seemed nice. The atmosphere was ok and the service SEEMED to be nice at first. We ordered two pea soups, two tuna salads, and some fish tacos. The fish tacos were mediocre, but the salad and the soups were tasteless and were made with without any effort. The tuna tasted as if it were from the can. We didn't even get one of the salads. The service was absolutely terrible. It was not attentive and the waiters were very unfriendly. One of the waiters recommended a wine that he didn't have. So without asking us he brought another wine that was more expensive and told us the price was the same. We asked for some pepper and received a pepper mill that was empty. We asked a different waiter for a different mill, but he refused to believe it was empty and brought it back. We asked him one more time and he finally budged. Sorry, but we cannot recommend this place.\n",

      "I took 20+ people to dinner here.\n",
      "They don’t deserve your business.\n",
      "They are terrible.\n",
      "First of all, the name of the restaurant is Kimchi Princess. I think you get to eat the left overs of the Princess after she eats, because it feels like the left overs are being served. The food is disgusting parts of the animal, none of them are premium quality.\n",
      "They also don’t serve Kimchi that is good quality. Koreans take pride in their kimchi, here they treat it like some scarce ingredient, they give you a very small amount of if, and it tastes like it has gone bad. If you have ever been to a real Korean restaurant, or Korea, you will spot that the Kimchi they serve has reached its expiration date. My Korean colleague was being polite and didn’t want to admit this, but she didn’t want any more Kimchi, which is a sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff members are rude. When we celebrated one of our team members, they said we are being loud and the neighbors tables are complaining. This is not the first time this has happened, but now that this has happened 3 times, I know what happens. This restaurant operated illegally in the neighborhood and the neighbors hate this restaurant’s loud noise. And they basically complain. They come and tell you are being loud and the neighboring tables are complaining, you ask which ones, they lie and they tell you everybody is complaining.\n",

      "No wonder why the restaurant was empty of customers as long as the management is so bad.\n",
      "We don't recommend visiting this shop at all. It's our first and last try to eat a korean food.\n",

      "In a nutshell, I was craving Korean food after a weeklong vacation in Florida, and Shin Jung happened to be close to the hotel (theme park area) and still open. I don’t know if it’s the best Korean restaurant in the Orlando area, but as a person visiting from California and growing tired of eating the typical vacation foods, this place managed to satisfy my craving for some rice, grilled meat, and spicy soup with an overall average dining experience. I think the place is fine if you’re visiting from out of town, but it will have you missing your favorite place from back home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I placed my order with about 20 minutes to closing – plenty of time for me to get to the restaurant. I ordered the BBQ chicken and spicy soup, basic “can’t go wrong” items from the menu. The woman was very adamant about the fact that they were closing in 20 minutes…maybe they have a lot of flakes on the phone orders? She reminded me 5 separate times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to some traffic, I arrived 5 minutes late – they called to make sure that I was still on my way. They were in the middle of cleaning the tables when I walked in…slight look of annoyance, followed by the look of relief that the customer didn’t flake on the order. I usually tip on my pickup orders, and she seemed surprised and appreciative of the gesture.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got plenty of food for my money. The side items (banchan) were average to slightly less than average. The pickled vegetables didn’t do anything for me, so I hardly ate any of it. Perhaps it was because it was the last order of the night and they thought I was going to flake on the order, but the soup was subpar. It was spicy and had tofu, but the soup was totally watered down and lacked flavor. Compared to the other items, the chicken was actually tasty. A large mound of rice, strips of chicken, and an occasional spoonful of forgettable spicy soup…not exactly heaven but a good stopgap.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know if ordering so close to closing had anything to do with my experience, but Shin Jung left me a little unsatisfied in terms of taste despite it temporarily halting my Korean food craving. Sometimes, average is better than terrible, so I can actually recommend this place if you’re from out of town and looking for a Korean food fix because I’ve had worse. This place is not too far from being better than average by simply improving their banchan and soups.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I'm Korean. I know my Korean food. And so do my parents. And we all agree that Myung Ga has the best Korean food in town. The service is as terrible as can be, but once you order, the food comes out quick, hot and delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say a major drawback is lack of servers on weekend nights. Hopefully the improve the service and invest in a few more servers on each shift. I would hate for them to tank because they couldn't get the food out of the kitchen and tend to their customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But other than the service, the food is great! The soup is excellent and the ban-chan is decent. I usually get the tofu soup (soon-doo-boo ji-gae) and kal-bi combo with my husband. Definitely enough food to fill us up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: Worth the short drive out west and definitely better than the rest in town.\n",

      "Recently visited Bamboo near the train station in Oxford for Lunch on a Saturday. It was pretty empty, we were not approached when we walked in. We saw two waiters but were ignored and not really acknowledged. We had to walk all the way into the venue until someone eventually offered us a table. It took them a very long time to come over and ask for our food and when we were ready we had to wave (not something I like doing as find it quite rude, but there was no one around when we wanted to order food) Also we ordered starters and mains and assumed the starters would come separately or first in this instance. Instead all the dishes arrived quite randomly in no particular order and my friend felt she had to start to make sure it didn't go cold! I really enjoyed the food, just thought it was really expensive for a lunch meal and felt that perhaps the bento offers for the week could be available for the weekend too.\n",
      "Anyway after we had finished, we had to ask for the bill twice and again had to wave, something I detest.. But the previous waiter had disappeared and the other waitress was on her phone.. So eventually we got the bill to find a confusing amount added without it stating what it was, eventually figuring out that 10% had automatically been added to our bill. Without sounding harsh, we discussed between us and decided that we didn't need to pay service charge as we hadn't received good service, so asked the waitress to remove it but she said she needs to ask her boss, we asked her this twice as she just stood there.. Eventually a woman came over but she was speaking on her mobile in front of us and looking at our receipt. In my opinion I thought this was quite rude, having been made aware this lady was the manager. When she got off the phone she informed us quite rudely if we turn to a specific page in the menu you will see that they add service charge automatically. However, we clearly and (awkwardly) stated that we wanted it removed. To which she replied only if you have had bad service, in this case myself and my two friends looked at each other and went on to explain to which she reluctantly removed the service. So if you want to go here for good food for a high price and terrible service, and a manager who makes you feel uncomfortable if you refuse to pay service charge then give it a go.. !\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This is the worst experience ever. I would expect better food than last time, but it still let me down. We went there for lunch, but right now my stomach is not comfortable in the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered three dishes, two is okay. Another one is Naengmyeon. I ordered this last time, and it was not as good as what it should taste. This time I think it may be made better, so I ordered it again. It is the terrible thing ever. I asked the manager to change the soup for noodles one time, but it is still not it should be. And the manager said this is the noodles should taste. I am an asian girl, and I have eaten Naengmyeon many times. I know what it should taste, and what the manager said is not satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not recommend to people who have eaten real Korean food.\n",

      "5 hour later, my stomach still feels comfortless.\n",
      "\n",
      "这家餐厅做的真的是越来越差，服务态度也不是很好。冷面真的是我吃过最难吃的，其他两道菜也不是很好吃，就是非常一般。如果你想念韩国菜，你就去。但是如果不是非吃不可，建议去别的地方\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Some of the foods was cold and I asked to be replaced and was never done and the order of foods was misunderstood and the waitress couldn't understand english well. The service tonight was absolutely terrible, I wont recommend Bamboo to anybody as a first experience wanting to try Korean foods but rater wait and try somewhere else. Foods is overprice as well comparing to other Korean restaurants in the UK.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "It was the most terrible lunch that we’ve had in Oxford. Their food was not satisfying, and the service was even worse. They paid no attention to us, and it seemed as if their only interest was to make easy profit. They were terribly slow at taking orders and offering other services but incredibly fast at cleaning up dishes. We had just started eating dessert when they took our money with the dishes, making A LOT of noise. It definitely was not the kind of service that costs 10% of our meal. I won’t say much about the food, for I might be biased due to their service, but I don’t think I would choose to go there ever again.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Nice food, pretty much like what I have had in Korea. Thus maybe not all to everyone's taste. Most things beautifully cooked and well- presented but I didn't like the pancakes, which were very greasy. The lamb skewers were exceptionally good, moist, tender and perkily spiced. Service was very efficient and attentive. The decor is nice and I saw a great little private dining room. Prices seem fair except for drinks. Small beers are £3.50 - but the Korean beer is genuinely from Seoul and delicious. The wine list is terrible and overpriced - as is wine in Korea.\n",

      "\n",
      "Food - We ordered the set meal for 2 as we thought this would be a good way of sampling food that we were not familiar with and have found, in previous situations, that the dishes on set menus are designed to be typical examples of the cuisine. There was quite a lot of food but the flavour and quality was very poor. We had a pork dish that looked promising but the meat turned out to be very fatty so not appetising at all, a savoury pancake which was tasteless, a soup with some leaves in it that tasted like salty water and was cold, a kind of vegetable and beef broth that came with a burner which actually caused it to boil over at one point onto the table. It also just tasted like salt and the beef seemed like it had been boiling away for hours in it.\n",
      "We do accept that it might be that Korean food is not to our taste but is it all supposed to just taste like salty water or of nothing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Attitude of manager - we tried all the food but decided we really didn't want to eat it (very unlike us!!) - see \"food\" above. We asked to see the manager to discuss this and explained, politely our concerns and disappointment. He didn't apologize and just shrugged his shoulders saying that they use good quality meat and gestured to us that the restaurant was full. I asked what he suggested we do about the bill given the fact that we were not happy and were leaving hungry. He just said we needed to pay. We had to ask to have the price of the rice removed (as we'd not had it). We ended up paying him just £1 less than the total bill, and no service charge. His attitude appeared rude, he didn't provide a receipt. All very disappointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service - Food arrived in dribs and drabs and staff seemed very rushed and hassled - no one told us what anything was and there was no distinction between which were part of the starter course and which was the main. It seemed like the waiting staff were not expected to interact with us - simply bring stuff to our table. This felt uncomfortable as we are used to building a bit of rapport with front of house staff.\n",

      "By law if a service charge is added to the bill, but not presented anywhere before, you can refuse to pay it. That is what we did in this case.\n",
      "However, the manager came to our table and insisted on us paying the service charge by stating that ALL restaurants in Oxford would do the same. After 10min discussion that let to nowhere we decided to leave half of the service charge.

      "Stay away, this place gave all 3 of my dining party terrible stomach aches. One of us basically was in the bathroom for multiple times the next day due to the food. The service was cold, and the food was honestly not that good. I've been to great restaurants like the Clove Club in London, and 3-star restaurants in Japan, this food was just mediocre and at worst, unsanitary. I do not recommend.\n",

      "We went there as a group of five for lunch. We ordered the 70 dollar set. It was fantastic with all kind of exotic but healthful ingredients. The serving women were terrible, really unfit for a Buddhist temple food: they were arrogant, curt, and rushing. If the Buddhist restaurant would like to make a good impression of the Buddhism, these servers do the exactly opposite. In most Seoul restaurants, the servers are cheerful and kind. But this restaurant was the not the case, and in that aspect, it stands out just as much as the excellent food does. It is a shame, The manager should seriously reflect on this point.\n",

      "The ambiance, I must say, is beautiful. The restaurant is in a renovated hanok (traditional Korean house). The lights are in the shape of lotus flowers which lends to the vibe of being transported to a day of old. That is where my praise of Sanchon ends.\n",

      "There is a choice of two seatings: Western table seating and the traditional Korean seating on the floor. We chose to do the traditional. Soon after we sat, there was a dance performance of traditional Korean dance. We turned in our seats to watch and take pictures. Minutes later, we were served our food (It is a set menu at 59,400 won.) There was no description of anything; they just plopped the plates down and left. That was fine; there was a menu in English that vaguely described what we were going to get. We were watching the performance so we didn't have a chance to eat. Yet we continued to get served. At one point, our waiter told us to clear one of the plates (Everything is family style.) so that he can put another plate in its place. We asked if the food can be served a little slower as we haven't started yet and he said, \"it's ready already.\" Okay...\n",
      "\n",

Nothing compared to this night.) I digress... The food was inedible. I don't understand these great reviews... I'm Korean and I grew up eating some of these dishes; I couldn't even eat the rice and kimchi. Most of the food is deep fried and quite oily. Many are vinegary and sour.\n",

I simply couldnt leave my house for the next 2 days. And it wasnt only me, it was half of the table experiencing the same symptops. One of us apparently made it to the hospital and got her stomach washed. We called the restaurant and they said sorry and nothing else. I sent an email expecting an explanation but no response. I called and demanded to talk with the restaurant manager but learned that it's her day off and she only reads emails once a week! I am going to send a health inspection towards this restaurant. We paid over 20k czk and this should not be the treatment we deserve.\n",

      "We dropped by here for lunch today. The waiter was unsure of menu items and substitutions allowed. There isn't a kids menu, which was fine with us but if you're traveling with kiddos that might be a turn off. The food was pretty good but they were not knowledgeable about allergens. They were also not accommodating at all about a substitution (extra salad instead of tempura veg pieces). The atmosphere was terrible. The entire time we ate they were blaring Korean rap music. Unpleasant to say the least. I think I'll skip this place because I can get better Korean food elsewhere and better atmosphere as well.\n",

      "I came here two weeks ago for Happy Hour with a friend and experienced the WORST customer service from our waitress, Alexis. I've worked in customer service for more than 8 years and was appalled with Alexis' skills. She seemed to have checked on every table around us except for ours and when I told her that the dish I ordered was too spicy, she did not offer me another dish. We had to ask multiple times to get our drinks refilled and even ask other staff to get things for us. The food was great (the only reason it deserves two stars) but Alexis' service was terrible.\n",

He just simply says 'I don't know but it's good' every time we ask something. Most of the food is good but one thing we order is terrible and we want to return it (we didn't know what it is, sorta play on luck when ordering the food. I don't know Korean) but the server is like 'errrrrr I'm sorry you can't'. He didn't refill drinks until we ask. One of the most terrible service I've been to.\n",

      "- Korean coffee was included in our set menu, this is just a powder coffee. Since it was already 9PM and both my friend and I are sensitive to caffeine, we asked for tea instead. The waitress was very nice, and asked a tall Korea guy who seemed to be the owner. He refused our request, which we thought was not very customer friendly. What is the difference? A 2 powdered Korean coffee or 2 cups of tea using 1 teabag?\n",

First I need to explain that I worked in Korea for a few years, and my wife is Korean, I also speak decent Korean. My friend I was dining with worked in Korea also as well and is aware of a Korean meal, he’s also dined at Yori previously. I agree with what many people say about the quality of the food, it’s very average, but hey, its Leicester Square, a tourist area.\n",

      "We received no side dishes, to those that have never entered a Korean restaurant, a Korean meal without a side dish of Kimchi, is basically not a Korean meal. This is not the biggest problem, after several years of kimchi, I’m not that fussed by it. But knowing that it should come with the meal, and doesn’t, in addition to the rudeness, annoyed us. In addition to this, the 3 tables surrounding us were seated by Korean’s (1 table were Korean-Americans), out of interest, I looked around, and they all had side dishes.\n",

      "When I have dined with my wife there previously, we have had side dishes.\n",

Yesterday was my last visit to Yori, and most likely Korean restaurants outside of New Malden.\n",

      "\n",
      "These things above, could make you wonder if the food is Asian style, but, it is. If I wanted to gather up beef, vegetables, particular sauces that goes with Asian cuisine and felt like cooking at home, this would be what I would come up with. Personally, I would add heat, as in hot spices, if I cooked at home, but this was not at home and if you are traveling, it can be a bit off of the interstate, though you would not to lose time in traveling because the road Ginger's is on, is the old east-west, west-east, before the interstate was put in, road.\n",
      "\n",
      "I rate Ginger's average, if I were in NYC, I would rate Ginger's poor. The food is not laden with sauce, it is not tasting of salt, it had salt, it just did not taste as if my mouth was demanding more water. By the way, speaking of water, another place where the water is terrible!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a cup of tea. It was Lipton green tea. I don't even use Lipton at home. Really, people? Not even oolong tea? How about a tea pot? Nope! A cup of hot water with a tea bag. I would expect the cup with a teabag, if I were visiting a neighbor and this would be acceptable. But, at a restaurant? They did not have a variety, just the one brand/type.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food, Korean style, beef tips, with a plate of vegetables, again, if I had cooked this at home, it's what I envision my meal would have turned out like. Please, don't think 'home cooked food', because 'home cooked food' is what you have when your Mother cooks or you cook, those dishes learned from your growing years. The food that makes you feel as if you are a child again. Ginger's is 'home cooked meal' the way you would make it, if you picked up a local magazine and found the recipe for Asian cooking, Korean style, etc. You can never be sure, you made it exactly right, you simply follow the recipe and hope for the best.\n",

The bar area and lounge seating area was filthy, dusty with sticky drink residue on bar and table tops.\n",

When we eventually got served I had to point to the beer tap in order to get served as the bar person had very poor English.\n",

The waiter forgot to order my food and I was waiting an hour for my dish, which only arrived after everyone has already finished eating. When they did bring it eventually, they didn't bring the sauce I ordered with it and it was just basically uneatable dry rice. I rang the bell multiple times with no attention. My friends were also waiting a very long time to get a drink as no waiters were coming over and ignoring the bells. I went to complain to the manager and they said they didn't expect it to be so busy (really? on a saturday night?). They didn't even offer to take my meal off the bill, so it really put a damper on my night and I felt really bad because I didn't want to ruin my friend's going away. Certainly they have lots to learn about customer service\n",

Honestly I've never seen such terrible service. They need to hire more staff. The food was decent though, or at least the food that arrived\n",

The general taste of the meat and the sauce had nothing to do with korean bulgogi. Trust me - I have eaten this exact dish around the world incl in Korea. This was a insult to the Korean kitchen!! Korean food usually tastes of something. This was the most terrible dull and tasteles meal.\n",

As we are all student, we wanted to go for the cheapest option, so we took 10 mins ordering. The girl who came first gave us a few more minutes upon request but then 5 mins later the lady came (guessing the owner) We said we wanted sets of side plates eg. 3x rice 1x bulgogi x3 eggs etc. The lady sarcastically said \"never heard of such a order\" then walked away after also telling us to put our drinks away (which we all understood and went along with) after her terrible attitude, we decided to cancel the order and I could not help but point out how rude she was. And she told me we were rude but the only thing we had done was take 10 mins ordering and laughed a little because we were happy in general (beautiful weather in England) This was a lowering experience for all of us. We werent taken seriosuly and the lady did not hesitate to attack us out of nowhere. She also said \"good idea\" after we wanted to cancel. Anyway, my point is that, you can have the best food in the world but if your service is terribly rude that place is bound to be empty. Why? Because you are not hospitable. Even if we spend a £1 in your restaurant, that £1 still goes into your pocket and it makes a difference. So dont treat customers depending on how much they can spend. Lady, you are terribly rude but you can fix it.\n",

      "It is with regret that I have come to write this kind of review. The standards set for eating out these days are much higher than what they were 15-20 years ago and in this context, simply put, the experience we had was desperately disappointing. The Korean Raw Beef was nearing frozen and lacked texture and taste. The meat for the Bulgogi Beef BBQ had so much water content that when it came off the hotplate, it looked and tasted like plain boiled beef. The service, although mildly attentive when we turn the heat up on the hotplate to desperately try and get some authentic BBQ taste, was beyond terrible with zero smiles, zero communication and frankly, quite laughable that they have the balls to charge a rate comparable with award winning fine dining restaurants. Yes, we are experienced diners in many cuisines and we do set a fairly high bar but bad food with bad service is a terrible and unforgivable combination. It is 2 out of 5 on the basis that there were a couple of dishes that did meet no more than the minimum standards expected from an authentic Korean restaurant.\n",

The manager took our order and suggested some dishes + sides. In essence the initiative was good although we felt rushed, as we didn't have the chance to look at the menu properly. The order came fairly quick and the food was good overall. The downside is the service, which I would say was terrible. Waiter(s)/tress(es) taking an arrogant attitude, no smiling, no communication. At some point one of the waitresses came to cut our meat and put it aside although we haven't asked for this or been asked if it was ok. We had to switch the grill on again, given we like our meat well-done. They also forgot one dish, which I had to order again. They waiter blamed us for not ordering it in the first place. As conclusion, if you are taking someone who is new to the city and Korean food, I would really reconsider other choices, given the high-bill and the service offered in return. I rated this restaurant average as the food is good but the service is terrible.\n",

This place apparently closes at 9:30 and we were seated and ordering by 9:15. Since there was no rush apparent we ordered a single drink each, party of two and 3 items from the menu. Our food arrived at 9:25 and at 9:30 we were asked to pay the bill but do not rush take your time. I happily paid so they could close the register and tipped 20% since they were so accommodating. We were just about wrapping up our meal at 9:45, rushing a bit out of courtesy when a woman named \"Jack\" came out of no where and said \"We have another engagement tonight and you have to leave, you may take your food to go!\" I was so shocked I said, are you serious. And she this woman replied \"absolutely you need to leave now.\" I just couldn't believe this, we were with 5-10 minutes of an amazing experience leaving on a high note, and encountered the worst personality and least apologetic person I have ever run into. We had a few more bites, sitting there in shock at this treatment, and my wife asked if she could finish her wine which had a couple of sips left or if we needed to take it to go. Jack came back with a Styrofoam soup container put the wine in it. I was so pissed I nearly yelled at this woman, I did express how displeased I was and was given an obstinate sarcastic \" Yes sir, Thank so yo much for your input.\" Not one apology not one of anything remotely resembling a decent behavior. We didn't even get a polite warning that we were going to be asked to leave. Not even a \"we are closing soon, please finish up as soon as you can\", what we received was \"You need to leave and you can take your food now!\" So this goes down as the single worst encounter I have ever had a restaurant anywhere in the world. Terrible Terrible Terrible, and no one working there cared at all. The worst part is I love their food and now cannot go back because I will have to relive this terrible ordeal.\n",

      "The food for the barbecue arrived, but it was frozen. We asked the young waiter if this was meant to be the case, as those of us who had tried Korean barbecue had never had this - his response was ‘yeah, might be’.\n",
      "\n",
      "We asked the manager again whether the meat was meant to be frozen and he explained that this was due to the need to cut it. However, looking at photos on here, it would appear that everyone else receives their food defrosted - I understand the concept of Korean barbecue, but I don’t expect to have to defrost my food as well as cook it!\n",
      "\n",
      "We tried to order another round of drinks - just some beers and wines, but the waiter taking our order didn’t understand what we wanted, so had to pass it over to the manager.\n",

      "My friend’s main arrived at around 8.15pm, and I was left without food - everyone else had finished. When my food finally arrived, it was going on to 9pm and, as I really had expected to be out by this point, I had to rush to eat, and it was too hot to really enjoy. This was a huge shame as I love bimimbab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our table was cleared and we sat and waited. My friend had asked for the bill whilst outside for a cigarette, and this had not arrived by the time she returned. It was getting on for after 9 by this point. We decided to put coats on and pay at the bar area. When we asked to pay for our food, the manager told us to ‘just wait’ and turned around to input all orders by hand whilst we stood and waited. After about quarter of an hour, the bill was ready... and also incorrect. Things on the bill that we hadn’t ordered and it topped off what had been a terrible experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The excuse from the manager that there lots of new staff in doesn’t cut it, I’m afraid, as no one else dining appeared to have the same problems with service. This is easily the worst service I and my friends had ever experienced, and I’m sorry to say that we won’t be returning, which is a shame as I think that, with training and good management, this place could be excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really sorry for the negative review, and I don’t want to be so negative, but I hope this can be taken as constructive criticism for the future. Maybe this was just an ‘off-night’.\n",

      "We were homesick for American breakfast, so we came here twice within 2 weeks: the French toast and pancake plates with bacon and sausage were well executed. We stuck to tea and juices; the coffee was terrible but frankly, we never found a decent cup of joe anywhere in Seoul.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I am a Korean. I grew up eating Korean food. I have had a difficult time finding a good Korean restaurant in the Netherlands, particularly in the Rotterdam, Den Haag area. I’ve heard some nice things about this place but having been to many korean restaurants and being disappointed, I was reluctant to try yet another 30+ EUR p.p. restaurant for a mediocre experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are my thoughts:\n",
      "\n",
      "Things I liked:\n",
      "- the choices are pretty good. You’re offered some staple korean dishes like bulgogi, pancakes, bibimbap, dapoki, mandu and various stews.\n",
      "- service is very good. Very fast, friendly. Not your typical Dutch restaurant experience. One of the best I’ve had here in NL!\n",
      "- decor is modern and hip and the atmosphere is vibrant\n",
      "- the use of an iPad to place your orders. It’s easy and one the order is placed your food arrives in 5 min!\n",
      "- the all you can eat concept is nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things I thought were “meh”:\n",
      "- the quality (ie flavour and textures) of the dishes. The bulgogi was ok. A little dry, which is probably because the cut of meat was not from the short rib where it should have been (ie the fatty part of the cow). The marinade was also not very flavourful - usually this should smack you in the face with a powerful, rich, meaty roast. This was not the case\n",
      "- the kimchi is pretty mild. Very sour, which means it has been aged for a while. It’s ok for the kimchi to be aged since that is kinda what kimchi is supposed to be. But this is nearing the point it needs to be turned into kimchi stew (ie chiguae).\n",
      "- the choices of gimbap were limited and not really korean style. It was more japanese style. Korean gimbap has more vegetables and include korean pickles. These did not.\n",
      "- the space is pretty cramped. It’s ok since you can expect this also in Korea, but for Dutch standards it felt a little “too cozy”\n",
      "- banchan (side dishes) is limited and is also kinda bland and tastes pretty much the same. Salty, and sour. Not full of the punch and variety and freshness you’d expect from good Korean banchan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things I didn’t like:\n",
      "- no free tap water. I mean, in this day in age, tap water is pretty much free almost anywhere you go in Europe. And for 30 EUR p.p. One should expect to be able to get this. Instead you are forced to buy bottled water. An immediate minus one star for this!\n",
      "- some dishes were flat our terrible. For example: the LA galbi must be avoided. Usually the pride and most memorable, defining dish of any good korean restaurant, this galbi was a total bomb. It was thin, dry, and flavourless. A huge disappointmemet. For this, another minus one star.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final thoughts:\n",
      "- if you are looking for a GOOD Korean restaurant, keep looking. After trying Seoul Sista I would say it’s “ok”. A nice place if you want to try something different compared to Chinese, Japanese or Thai. But don’t expect this to be a truly amazing Korean cuisine experience.\n",
      "- the location and atmosphere is nice. For that alone it’s a nice place just to hang out\n",
      "- it’s a BBQ, so that means your clothes will smell of BBQ food. They have mechanical vents above each grill table so the fumes are minimised but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing just be aware of this.\n",

      "My wife and I bought a seafood dish to cook at the table.\n",
      "There were no serviettes on the table, there were only stainless steel chopsticks so we asked for fork and spoons.\n",
      "The waiter delivered the water and glasses to the table but it wasn't long before several blowflies were buzzing around the seafood. One ended up in the water bottle and when the waiter was called he replaced the water.\n",
      "The attention by the waiter was terrible and not once did he ask if \"everything was ok\"? I had to call for proper service like could we have serviettes.\n",
      "When we left to pay the bill the cashier charges extra for two small bowls of rice. We were never told that this was an extra charge. The cashier had a weird smirk on his face when I complained. I also asked if he charged for the extra flies??\n",
      "Pathetic service, food was very ordinary at $55.00 and overall a total waste of time and money.\n",

      "We were travelling with friends in cairns and decide to have a korean cuisine dinner saw bobzip thinking we can satisfy our cravings but it turn out to be very disappointed expensive restaurant with terrible food! I highly not recommend this to others!! Trust me. Im a big fan of korean food but not this. Tsk\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The food here was terrible. We asked for friend dumplings and the owner bought out a large burrito looking object that was over fried. The food here tasted nothing like Korean food. The meat was not even seasoned and was just thrown on a pan and then into a plate. The bulgogi was terrible. The owner was not friendly and acting like she didn't want to speak. If you want good Korean food this is not your place.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This was the second time eating at Olle and will be the last. The first time we went, it was a decent experience. However this time, the service was terrible. For the amount of food we ordered, we did not receive nearly as much attention as we should have. The food is average at best but what brought the whole meal down was the attitude of the server. He blatantly ignored us when we tried to catch his attention several times. The other servers were a bit better but still no where near as helpful as you would expect them to be. Totally undeserving of the service charge but begrudgingly paid it anyway just to get out of there without a fuss. The food was not worth the amount of money we spent there.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Service terrible; forgot about us once orders taken. (Tip fixed at 18% for large groups. NO incentive for good service.) Food bad: basically thin film strips of meat that is either raw or well done; no in between. Vegetables weird assortment that are more like bad condiments.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Was in Boston for pleasure trip last week with girlfriend and her daughter. We were looking for an Asian restaurant near Harvard Square where we were staying, but there wasn't anything well-rated there. Saw this place in Central Square (one subway stop away) had at 90% approval rating on Urban Spoon. We'd all had Korean food before and had some idea of what good Korean food was. Its not that the food was terrible, it was just way overpriced - twice as much as we'd pay for the same dishes back home in Canada and it was nothing special. I had a buckwheat noodle dish (served intentionally cold, much to my surprise) with a few slices of beef (also cold) and cucumber. Pretty much street food in Korea I'm guessing, and it cost $16 before tax and tip. I was still hungry afterwards. My dining companions were equally unimpressed with value for money and the general quality of the food. Not worth the 90% urban spoon rating, or the subway ride IMHO.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The food was ok, but the service was terrible. Couldnt get what we wanted. Had to ask so many times in a not busy hour. The waiter of our table dispared. Had management issue. Hate to being gawked. Although the price is cheap, I will not return.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This is not your typical Korean restaurant. EVERYTHING that you would normally get with your meal, side dishes and a bowl of rice, you had to pay for. I was very shocked when the waiter asked me if I wanted rice with my bbq beef. Well, what else would I eat with it??? And yes, every side dish we wanted (that usually comes with the meals in other Korean restaurants) we were charged for. Its expensive here to begin with, food was not that great, the kimchi that we ordered was terrible. Definitely not worth it your money. I'd go somewhere else for Korean food.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I was regular customer for more than 1.5 years until last week they charged me £90 instead of the £8.5 plus 0.5 card payment fee. First of all the waiter who did it didn't even gave me a receipt from the card payment terminal and after he walked away my phone sent me notification that he took a payment of £90 from my Apple Pay. The manager came over and he wasn't really bothered about the whole thing. He said he won't do cash refund and he did a £81 refund which I have to wait 3-5 working days to receive back and they think its completely fine. Waiter personally never came back to me to apologise and nobody seems to be bothered about the whole thing. Just wait for your refund that was all the comment. This is the kind of experience what they want you to have if you're a regular customer and going to eat there on 2-3 times on monthly bases for more than a year. Also after this I went back again and they selling Rice cakes and fish cakes on the menu but actually they only give you the rice cake and they still expect you to pay the price they displaying on the menu for the price of rice plus fish cake together. They answer for this is just dont eat it if isn't like that. Manager has bad attitude and just coming up to argue with regular customers instead of he should just change the item on the menu and sell it as a rice cake only for a lower price because theres no fish so he shouldn't charge for something actually you never get. Also he were telling us that he dont want us to go there again. Well theres plenty of restaurants in London so I dont need to go to a place full of scumbags and unprofessional waiters who can't figure out a simple primary school math 8.5+0.5=9. Also the food quality is very poor, not like couple months ago, service slow and terrible and the management and customer care is unprofessional and not up to standards. Im not recommending this place to anyone, but if you decide to eat there try to avoid card payments because they might try to charge you 10x times more and then they will just get moody and give you attitude.\n",

      "Come here if you want the worst service ever and wait 45 minutes for 2 plates of raw meat. Also come here if you want to ask 4 different incompetent blank-faced waiters to hurry your order, only to have it come after another 45 minutes. Oh and if you want to get sassed by the manager who told us to \"order better next time\", come here!\n",
      "\n",
      "We accidentally ordered 2 of the same soup (when we tried to cancel it they said it was already being prepared - as in they had a bowl out and was ready to scoop the liquid into it?). One was bland and watery but the other had flavor and was salty - different quality of food within a 1 hour period (that's how long it took for the \"prepared soup\" to come). The table next to us also had to wait a long time for their food. Only redeeming factor was the one nice young Asian boy who actually knew what good service meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, terrible service, subpar non-traditional food, outrageous prices. Overall poor structure and lack of communication between the rude higher-ups and confused waiters. Would not recommend unless you are the only person left in a post zombie apocalyptic world and are absolutely starving!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "It has been a while since I have been back here. During my college days, I remember coming here for good Korean food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, this was such a terrible experience for me. To begin with, it took them a while to take down our orders as only a few servers were allowed to take orders. We have to ask them twice and inform them that we were ready to order. Usually, Korean restaurants do serve some appetisers like kimchi, potato salad, bean sprouts and radish while waiting for the food to be served. We did not get anything at all. For mains, I ordered the spicy soup with seafood, tofu and egg. I think they should change this description as the food only came with 3 pcs of mussels, a lot of tofu and an egg. I believe this is such a rip-off considering it was around 10 pounds for something that should not really be called seafood. I was actually expecting more from it and not just 3 pcs of mussels which were taken out of the shell. Another dish we ordered was the spicy soup with beef and vegetables. The soup once again came with only 3 pcs of thinly sliced beef and some glass noodles. What is with the 3 pcs portion size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, we were so put off with these that we decided to call it the night. We would definitely not be going back and instead just stick to Arang.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This was possibly the worst Korean restaurant I have ever been to, Seoul, New York, and London combined. We were a party of 12, and ordered their set menus for each person. For 30+ pounds per person we got three paltry dishes of tasteless bulgogi as the main course.... for a table of 12! Of course, the portion of appetizers were extremely small as well. I never thought I would ever pay this much for a course menu and still come out hungry.. well, this was a first. Also, their service was slow and generally terrible, and my company confirmed that service is generally worse when Koreans come to this restaurant. I really don't think it can get any worse than bad food, expensive prices, and atrocious service.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The food is good but I have had better else where for cheaper but their service is terrible they either didn't understand what we where talking about or the Manager was down right rude.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters the manager wasn't even dressed like a manager and when something has run out they didn't even tell us until we chased them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price is expensive compared to other places but I would have thought the service would be better but it wasn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Skip this place and head a little further down the road for a better experience, I can't remember the name of the other Korean place but just walk towards Chancery Lane and its on the left hand side, you can't miss it it big! About 100m further down if not closer.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I love Asadal. I've been there many times, and I would (and will) go back. The food is great. Really tasty. And the atmosphere and decor is very nice. It's a wonderful place to go with a group of friends (enjoying Korean BBQ, and trying different things), to catch up with a friend (you can hear each other, as it's never very loud), or on a date.\n",
      "\n",
      "But... the service is horrible. Every time I've been, there has been an issue. Often, the waiter/waitresses don't speak English. Which always strikes me as odd, for a restaurant in central London.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a severe food intolerance to garlic, and every time I go, it's such an effort to get an answer as to whether a dish has garlic in it or not. Either they don't understand and have to send someone else over to ask. Or they vaguely understand, but not enough to get that I can't eat it (\"only a little bit of garlic\" isn't a good enough answer).\n",
      "\n",
      "I was there tonight, and I asked the waiter to ask in the kitchen if a dish had garlic. He told me that he didn't think it did. I asked if he can ask. He said \"I think it should be fine\". I said \"it's not fine if it has garlic, I can't eat it, I get very sick\" and he kept repeating that he thinks it won't be a problem. It took a long time to convince him to please just ask. He didn't know that it didn't have garlic, he just kept saying that it's all pre-mixed, so that they can't take it out anyway if it does, but that he doesn't think it does, and that it should be fine. That is not good service.\n",
      "\n",
      "So... in conclusion, great food (worth going back for), terrible service (worth over-looking because the food and venue are great). But it would be great if they could improve on their service. I would easily rate it a 5, if they did.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I was in central London yawning for Asian food and this place seem to be in the right place at the right time. I was wrong. The food was okay but there are not the typical Korean hospitality you see in other Korean restaurant. The barbeque I ordered was burned, the wine I ordered was delivered late, and the bill was wrong. The food is okay in this place but the service is terrible.\n",

      "So we asked about the closing time, if it was ok to eat after this time as most restaurant say close on a certain time, they just don't accept any further customers walking in but customers who are already there eating should be ok. Their response was that you had to finish by 11pm. Since we were hungry and wanted to try this Korean restaurant, we still went ahead, but after leaving the place we actually regretted in going in, as there service were terrible and looking over you every 2 mins to see if you had finished your food. The long and short of it, were unpleasant and made you felt uncomfortable when eating. We would not recommend this restaurant.\n",

      "We ordered bulgogi and spicy marinated pork. They recommended the spring onion and lettuce wrap with soy paste as its traditionally eaten as a lettuce wrap. This was our first experience doing it so we were shown. They cooked the meat for you to your liking which suited us just fine. They served the bulgogi first and we were so blown away by it, then the pork. We couldn't actually decide which was better. We also ordered beef bibimbap to share, this was ok, not the best i've had. Lacked in flavour somewhat but not terrible.\n",

      "My party of five was going to eat here lat night ( 13 Apr 13), but the waiter had terrible service from the start! We were in line waiting & he promised us the wait would be five minutes. He then proceeded to let other people go in front of us! We called him out on what he did & he said we could eat at a table, but be out by 830 pm due to another reservation. It was currently 715 pm.... Due to how this started off, we decided to leave and go somewhere else! We went Sushi Hiroba down the road instead which also had Korean/ Japanese food! Much nicer and way cheaper w/service for their customers! Do not go to Asadal-- not worth the poor customer service!!!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Food here is good. The service is the worst I've had in any restaurant in London. We had to ask 4 different people to take our food order and each one said they'd send someone to take it, never happened. The waitress who prepared our meat bbq was utterly charmless, didn't bother smiling. Ordered a coke and was brought a can, the waiter said he'd bring a glass and never came back again. You're supposed to eat the bbq wrapped in lettuce using your hands, which inevitably get sticky. They do not have finger bowls or wet wipes. We were told by our waiter that we'd need to go to the toilet and wash our hands. Dinner was removed and no one bothered to clean the scraps of food and sticky bbq sauce that littered the table. Dessert was served amidst the mess by which time we were so annoyed we demanded to have the table cleaned. The bill came and we asked for the service to be removed as it had been so terrible (a first for me), the waitress didn't even blink at this, no manager came over to ask why we weren't happy. Absolutely no interest in customer service.\n",
      "In conclusion, avoid this place. There are plenty of other Korean restaurants in London that serve similarly good food without the terrible service that this place offers.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "It is quintessentially narrow minded and english to complain about portion sizes, but in this place, appropriate. Good meat cooked well is expensive, fair play, ok meat marinated and quickly slapped on a bbq (not at our table where we could see it, but nearby) should not cost £10-12 per tapas sized portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, despite racking up a hefty bill with a party of eight, we thought the restaurant might be keen to take our money. Alas they had no interest whatsoever in being remunerated for their food and service (rushed, unfriendly, forgot drinks orders) and we were left to languish at our table without refreshment for about half an hour after asking for the bill.\n",

Even worse, the service is also terrible, we asked service many many times, but no one respond! Besides, we ordered lots of food, they looks really tiny not as normal size! Never never go again!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Bland, boring food with bored service. Nothing was terrible but nothing was very good either. Take, for example, one of the dishes we ordered - seafood with rice and vegetables: it contained seafood (boiled, tasteless), it contained vegetables (a few pieces of half-cooked red and green pepper) and it contained rice (watery and bland). So it certainly fullfilled the trade descriptions act - but was it worth £13.50? Er...no.\n",

Service was unfriendly and non existent never checked on me despite being empty of customers.\n",

The food was very spicy and the \"meat\" dish was just bones in some sweet barbecue sauce, the salad was just iceberg lettuce with peanut butter dressing, the cabbage dumplings were super spicy but the pork dumplings were edible, 5-side dishe combo was terrible, we ate just the rice. Maybe we did not order the right food, but that was what our waitress recommended. The service was on-and-off, but very friendly. We probably would not go back.\n",

      "I read the reviews and decided to visit this place. First of all, the place wasn't clean...the bathroom looked like the ones you find at the gas stations. The service was terrible and the food was average/overpriced. By far this is the worst Korean placed I've visited in San Antonio!!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I had a horrible meal here. I selected the chef's menu. Most of the courses were mediocre and the entrees were terrible. I ordered my beef medium Rare, and they overcooked one side of it to a hard dry well done. Instead of fixing the mistake in the kitchen and grilling another piece of beef, they simply flipped it over hoping I would not notice. My wife had the lamb which was mushy and disgusting. How did this place get a Michelin star? For a great meal try Mingles, Dosa, Zero Complex or Joo Ok.\n",

      "The food itself was quite shocking. Almost all dishes were far too greasy/oily, one had so much salt added that it was inedible. The one positive was the sea urchin dish my date ordered, which he said was quite good. But 1 good dish out of 5 is not good enough for this level. We chose to leave after one bite of the main dish.

      "It is probably a good place for Koreans who have never tried modern food but definitely not worth a visit for anybody who has been in any good cuisine restaurant not to mention a Michelin star one.\n",

Food was not terrible, but was bland and unrefined. More importantly, you could easily find better tasting food at a lot of local “star-less” restaurants, at half the price.\n",
      "Wait staff spoke good English and was polite. However, food was served at light speed. She brought the next dish before I finished the previous one. I tolerated it until we reached the last dish when she came to ask us to select whether we wanted Bibimbap or noodles. At that time, I was still working on the second-last dish whereas my husband had finished his. I said to her:”I haven’t finished my dish yet, I would select later.” Instead of going away, she turned to my husband and asked for his choice. Michelin starred? Unbelievable!\n",
      "Venue-wise, just a traditional Korean restaurant, nothing remarkable.\n",

Went inside and was seated by the receptionist at the table we chose. Everything seems excellent. And all terrible things happened from then on. It took 30 minutes for a waiting staff to come and asks if we want to order although 3 of them already passed as by. Finally a lady came and asked if we wanted to order (even if we we're already looking around for someone so we can order). Checked for some recommendations and got one. Ordered the recommended chicken wings. I asked to the not so accommodating lady if I can order draft beer while waiting for the order. The lady frowned and said that it is not available. I asked if they already informed the lady outside and she really showed her discomfort and said yes. Left the restaurant since the lady can not give us any alternative.\n",

Why didn't we request more ... here is the perfect segway ... one of the other major problems for us was the service. To say it was terrible would be giving them the benefit of the doubt. We suspect that the mandatory tip policy for our size group gave the servers an out so that they could hang out and visit with each other, which they did without a care. The food was good so it is a shame that they are a penny wise and a pound foolish while treating their guests with blatant disrespect.

Oh, and the soup. The soup was terrible. It was a clearish broth that had tofu but tasted like fish. I disliked it very much. I asked the waitress what the heck made it so fishy and she said shrimp flour? It would have been good if they left that wretched stuff out. The chicken was super spicy, I liked it okay. The sushi was also really terrible, I gave it to the boyfriend. The dumplings were deep fried and one of my boyfriends had nothing in it.

I visited this place, Sulbing at Hongdae, ordered my usual hot Americano. There was a large bottle of milk sitting on the counter. I asked the server if I could add a little of milk to my coffee, he responded gruffly \"If you were going to add milk to it, why didn't you just ask for Latte instead?\" and then he said \"NO\". He absolutely was not going to give me any.

Service was terrible but now I understand why...a 10% service ‘tax’ is added to your bill regardless of how shocking it is! And when the bill arrived there was £15 of extras on there that we had not had! You need to get the basics right...good service and attentive staff are key to a profitable business. Would I go back? Not sure yet.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Ok, where do I begin with all my disappointments... First of all, definitely over priced. At the first glance, the price looks average compared to all other Korean restaurants. But when the dishes come out, we noticed that all the portion size are ridiculously small for the price they charge! We have 5 adults and 3 small children (4,6,and 11) in our party, so we thought ordering 2 appetizers to share and then 1 dish each person would be enough. While we were waiting, there were no side dishes that we were accustomed to at other Korean restaurants. The only thing we got was a tiny (I mean, TINY) side of Kimchee and pickled radish. No other side dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we our food came out, more disappointments came. 3 tofu soups we ordered were so small that are half size of a regular tofu soup and no eggs were served, they charged us $11 - $13 each. The seafood pancake, which included shrimp, squid, and other seafood in its description, has no seafood and was about 2 inch. smaller than regular Korean pancake. (imagine you think you ordered a medium pizza and realized it was actually a personal pizza). The pork Bolgugi (bbq'ed pork) my husband ordered was also half of the meat we get in other Korean restaurants, and was charged $17 for that. The dumplings we ordered included 6 pieces of over fried sad looking dumplings, that was 7 bucks. The two BimBam (sizzling rice in stone bowl) was average size, and average taste. We had to add a stir fried noodle dish so at least we will not go home hungry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it's the taste. My favorite dish when going to a Korean restaurant is normally the tofu soup, especially on a cold winter day. This tofu soup is hands down the worst soup I have ever tried. I can honestly say the Shin ramen noodle's soup that comes in a package can easily beat their tofu soup. The seafood pancake and the dumplings were over fried, and burnt at places, and the pork Bulgogi on a bed of onions were less than average.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we paid about $130 for this disappointing meal, with no drinks at all.

We ordered the \"Classic Korean BBQ Combo\" (for 2), which included Banchan, SSAM (lettuce), Steam rice, Edamame. For the BBQ, we had Arisu short rib galbi, marinated short rib galbi, bulgogi, boneless flat ion, and pork belly. We had ice-cream for dessert. Very good customer service, although they looked very busy. They changed the grill for us in the middle.\n",
      "In terms of the food, there was a lot of it; but when we finished everything I felt \"just\" full. I certainly could have more. We both liked the bulgogi the best. The sauces were very very very good I have to say. I didn't like the pork belly; it had a terrible odour in it (as thought the pork meat wasn't fresh - we didn't have a diarrhea in the end though!).\n",
      "My friend and I enjoyed the dinner overall. But since neither of us is a chef, we thought that it may be better either they cooked the meat for us, or give us some recommendation on how long we should cook the meat.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Service was terrible. The one server on the patio on a hot day was not appropriate. The person was very forgetful under the circumstances. Server brought dishes for one person, when clearly there were two present! The food was disappointing. Soft-shell crab was so overdone it could have been anything. We wanted to try Korea-town and were not impressed.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I have been to other tower type restaurants before and I somewhat knew what I was in for - a nice view but bad food. HanCook restaurant certainly did not let me down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the good. The view is nice, although not overwhelming. I went to the restaurant for dinner at around 7 PM in October, so it was somewhat dark by the time I got there. It is not a revolving restaurant unlike the more expensive French restaurant which is on a higher floor, so you don't get all the views of the Seoul skyline. However, the views are still quite nice and can make for a nice dinner. The cost of the dinner also includes the cost of going up the tower, so take that into account if you do want to go up the tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the bad. The food was absolutely atrocious! You do get a choice of an a la carte dish with your purchase of dinner (of 2 or more people, I believe). We chose an abalone/seafood hot pot. The hot pot items were flavorless, the abalone had no flavor and was not cooked well, and the other items were terrible. The buffet items did not fare much better. There are a variety of Korean items, none of which were good or appetizing. There weren't that many hot items as well, compared to what you would typically see in a buffet. There were plenty of cold items though. Most disappointing was the limited dessert section. The service was also quite slow - the waitress took a long time to take our a la carte order and it took a long time for the a la carte order to arrive. The furnishings in the restaurant also seemed to be in the initial state of falling apart - chipped chairs, cushions, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, our hotel attempted to get us reservations the day before. However, our hotel indicated that the restaurant did not have any additional reservations. What is interesting about that is that the restaurant was not half full the entire time I was there - so I have no idea why HanCook wasn't taking reservations for that night!\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant definitely lives off its views. I would suggest going to another restaurant for dinner...\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The biggest problem was the wait. At least I thought so until I ate the chicken. With probably dozens of Korean restaurants in Koreatown, I don't know how this place survives with such mediocre food and terrible service.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is kind of set up like a fast food restaurant (except the food is NOT fast). Once you pick up your food, you find a seat in the restaurant, probably upstairs where most of the seating is. Patrons leave the tables a mess and no one is up there cleaning tables so you have to pick a table based on which one is the least sticky.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The fried chicken here is not worth your time. Hardly any meat on the bones and dry. No thanks. The spicy sauce is the better of the two options. The garlic sauce is terrible. Seating is like a food court.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We saw some good reviews and decided try Hankook. For the price we paid, I am sure it wasn't the best decision we have made in our 'dining out' forays.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food wasn't all that bad, but the general atmosphere was terrible. The staff seemed more interested in their loud conversations, or busy with their smart phones… one of the senior staff (I presume) walked in and sat on the steps to one of the private rooms and began to discuss salaries and visa status with some of the staff - arguing about various issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The set-up anyways isn't appealing, and after this experience I would not visit again.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We were regular Korean food customers and yesterday evening we had the most terrible experience at Insadong Korean Restaurant, Coquitlam, a simple BBQ dinner lasted for three hours in a hot stuffy room with unseasoned tasteless meat which was mostly left untouched..\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst we had dim sum lunch at a Chinese restaurant in Coquitlam one on the group mentioned a squid salad he had earlier which was most palatable and the restaurant refused to sell as additional dish other than as an item in the set combo. We were so interested that all agreed to try the dish the same evening. Reservation at Insadong was made right away, and we had to hang around for three hours in Coquitlam instead of heading home to Richmond which is a 45 minutes drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more we anticipate, the greater the disappointment and despair. We arrived at 6 in the evening. First we were sat in a somewhat smoky side room (the main dining room was cool ad clear, but was full). We waited for more than ten minutes and nobody served tea or took order, even though one server was running in and out of the room, serving other tables. Continual pressing the ring on the table did not help (later on the server explained the ring was broken).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally we ordered the combo for $119.99 instead of the combo at $79.99 because the former included the much talked about squid salad. Another ten minutes gone, we still had no tea or the regular Korean small dishes. More smoke in the room from other tables. We pressed for help and were told that the exhaust had broken down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some minutes gone by, the lone server apologised to us that he forgot our order, but promised that the kitchen would hasten the process. Then the usual Korean small dishes came. At about seven, we were served with some pan-fried fish and mushroom which was not in the combo menu. The server told us that the squid salad was not available as the dish had been discontinued three four months ago. We argued with the server, and later on with the restaurant manager. If the squid salad had actually been discontinued, it should be excluded from the menu in the first place, or we should be told when placing the order, or been advised before we consumed the small dishes. We told the restaurant why we came, and why we ordered the more expensive combo. Eventually, all we got was a bowl of clam soup as compensation, and the determination that we will never come again.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Don't be intimidated by the menu, just order a protein that sounds good to you and trust your server to take care of the rest. We had Prime Steak, garlic pork, and Sea Bass, all were wonderful. I loved the steak, our friends the pork, and my husband the fish. I would recommend one protein per two people as the portions are large. A bit pricey, but not terrible.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I've tried once at visit of Orlando, this place looks quite decent but service was so poor. And most surprising matter is they forced 18% gratitude in my bill. What the F***. How terrible it is.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Terrible, slow service. Seriously - 2 hours to get you a dish. Dirty plates, dirty glasses. Food tastes terrible.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Just had dinner at Ouga and it was nothing special, very average. The bamboo rice is terrible, basic boiled rice in a bamboo cup with some charcoal, no flavour whatsoever. The beef was tender but when you are paying 45000W for 150 grams you don’t expect a huge chunk of bone.\n",
      "I would not recommend this restaurant.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "A group of us tried out this new restaurant in Pattaya on or near their opening day (you can see us in their photo as they used our presence to promote their place) and although the staff was friendly, the food was terrible, at least in terms of their meat. They recommended the pork neck as their top choice and it was nothing more than tasteless fat (with very very little meat!)!!! In fact, the menu offers very little choice in terms of meat selection. It’s an insult to Koreans to label this place a Korean bbq restaurant!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We came at 9.40 and they refused to serve with terrible attitude, saying that they close at 10, as all restaurants in Amsterdam do:)) Too bad for Korean food and culture.\n",

      "Im not sure if there is an authentic Korean restaurant where Korean people go to eat in this city but if there is please go there for an authentic experience. I'm really sad to know people think this restaurant serves Korean food because it DOES NOT.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a real disservice to people when you change the food so much that it is not recognizable anymore. I don't believe in \"changing the recipe to suit the local taste buds\". Do you think you would enjoy Indonesian food that's been so altered as to not be distinguishable anymore from the authentic deliciousness that you know?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wouldn't it be atrocious to think someone altered herring so much because foreign taste buds wouldn't like it? NO. You let them taste it how it is traditionally prepared and let them decide for themselves. I tried my first herring today thinking I would not enjoy it but it turned out I really liked it.\n",

      "If you care to read further for a description of this tainted version of Korean food, read on. Otherwise find a different restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want meat candy this is your place. All of the meat, save for the sirloin, has a marinade on them that was sweet. The items that were supposed to be spicy were not spicy but again sweet. This is NOT Korean food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically the meats do not have any marinade on them for cuts such as the samgyeupsal (pork belly), duck, beef shoulder blade, beef rib meat, etc. You cook them over high heat grill searing the meat to about medium for beef or cooked through for pork. Then you would use a sauce made from soybeans and wrap it in lettuce leaves to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality of the meat was so poor. The sirloin was chewy. The other cuts in the marinade were tender but that was because of the sweet marinade that made the meat soft. I understand they need to turn a profit but serving low quality meat at 28.50 euro per person is disappointing to say the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kimchi. Being Korean I know what good kimchi, subpar kimchi and BAD kimchi tastes like. This was beyond bad. The cabbage kimchi was subpar but the gakdugi (cubed radish kimchi) was terrible. It was sweet! Kimchi is not supposed to be sweet! There are approximately 400 types of kimchi; not ONE of them is sweet. The cucumber kimchi was flaccid and, yes you guessed it, sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We tried a few of the other dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nengmyun (cold noodle dish) TERRIBLE. Why? Sweet!!! It is supposed to be clear starch noodles in a clear beef stock with a touch of vinegar giving it a hint of sourness. This was a bowl of chewy noodles in a sweet soup.\n",
      "\n",

      "The service was actually very good. Helpful, prompt, and courteous. After all this, I feel terrible for saying that I won't go back.

      "Came in on a Sunday with my wife, about 20% of the restaurant was filled, mainly empty at about 3PM. We were lead to a table for 2 at the back.\n",
      "The chair cushion was ratty and ripped as well as covered with crumbs, I wiped it off myself. The table was incredibly wobbly and moved every time I rested by hand on it. This would have made for an unpleasant meal. We moved to a booth right next to the table, this was much cleaner. Waitress comes up after a few minutes and tells us \"you can't sit here\"!! I found this ridiculous in a mainly empty restaurant. We pointed out that there are 2 other booths (that typically accomodate 4) with 2 people seated. I explained that where we were seated has some issues. She still insisted we move or we won't be served. This is a terrible attitude in today's day and age, there are way too many choices. Good food or not! A good meal is also a good service experience. It's not only about the food. Why give business to an establishment where the staff are sour faced and unpleasant. They have definitely lost my patronage.\n",

Good on you Kimchi for directing business to your competitors who definitely outperform you in customer service.\n",

We will stay away if we can help it for dinner. Expensive and really terrible service depending on the mood of the lady boss...!\n",

      "I'm from L.A. visiting Orlando, and this is the absolutely the WORST Korean restaurant I ever experienced. Food was terrible, Kimichi was sour than a sourkraut, way overpriced. Very disappointed. I went there only because they had nice photos on their website, but very deceiving. They might just cater the Korean tourists who comes just once, and don't expect any return customers. I don't see any locals returning to this restaurant. I'm glad I didn't take any guests with me.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Went while visiting Orlando with family. terrible food and overpriced. food tasted like they were made by first time cook. very slow service although there were only 2 tables occupied. asked for extra napkins and only got 3 cocktail napkins. The waiter had the audacity to ask for 20% service charge added to the bill since there were 9 of us. Will not go back.\n",

      "When you try out a place that has great reviews and you come away with a terrible experience, it always makes you wonder if you happened to have a fluke of an experience. I dragged my family out here one day because I wanted to try Korean food and after reading so many great reviews, I figured it would be totally worth it. Wrong. First of all, getting seated was more complicated than it should have been. Once seated, it took a while to get menus and orders in (probably about 30 minutes of wait time total and the place was not that busy). We all ordered bulgogi and the orders took about another 30 minutes to arrive. What came out on our plates didn't just look unappetizing, it tasted terrible and was extremely dry. The portion size was also quite small compared to the cost (if I remember right, it was about $13) We each ate a little off our plates and then asked for the check. To top it all off, my husband got sick later that night - he had eaten the most out of all of us. Truly a terrible experience and one that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Maybe we just came on an off night but for me, it's too risky to try again.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "it is nothing authentic, nor tasty for someone originally from the region. they really should invest some time to improve their recipes. I can’t believe some comments that said food was good. simply food is terrible.\n",

      "The food was not good the kimchi has 3 little pices of pork and there kimchi is not even well fermented thats why the soup of the kimchi it not tasty, the chicken terriyaki its terrible ,the bulgogi is ok.\n",

      "==========\n",
      "It was my first and last visit. The place was dirty, the service was slow and the food was terrible. I ordered a chicken dish and it was tasteless - it was overcooked and not edible. The service was pathetic. The server never came to our table again until we asked for the bill. A wasted evening and a waste of money. If you want good food, clean tables and good service - go somewhere else - anywhere else!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The food was pricey but tasty and the decoration was superb. However, the service was terrible which made our experience deeply disappointing. We did not seem to be welcomed by the staff as soon as we entered the restaurant. Most probably because we were not their usual type of clientele. Also, the waitress seemed constantly annoyed when taking our orders and when serving us. A smile would have been appreciated. But the most negative part about our experience was that as we were leaving the restaurant, we overheard the staff complaining about us which is absolutely not professional. At least have the decency to wait for us to leave. We are definitely not coming back to Onggi and we do not recommend their service...\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Finally caved in to try this restaurant, as I was in a bit of a hurry and it didn't appear to be busy. The food was 'alright' but the service was terrible. Not sure what happened but we waited for over 45 mins for our food (same issue for the person who came in after us and sat near us). The wait staff were apologetic but that doesn't overcome the fact that I wasted most of my lunch time waiting for food.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I love Korean BBQ... and this was NOT great. Perhaps the a la carte options are better, but all-you-can-eat BBQ was absolutely awful. Everything tasted like it was soaked in straight sugar and MSG. Service was quite slow, no refill on anything, having to flag down servers each time. They were busy, maybe just understaffed for the number of tables available. Either way, this was a terrible choice for Korean BBQ.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Terrible service and business etiquette. My wife and myself were having a ball of a time in bkk as usual eating and drinking. We decided to visit kwang Han Roo in sukhumvit korea plaza as we love korean food. As reviewed by tripadvisor, this restaurant came highly reccomended.\n",
      "We decided to try the pork buffet bbq in the restaurant at 290 baht per person and as my wife likes kimchi, we decided to order ala carte kimchi soup and kumchi fried rice.\n",
      "The waitress came and gave us 4 different types of pork. Marinated and plain. She proceeded to cook the pork and cut all the 4 plates of pork for us as we assumed that this this the first round of meat for us to try and if we wanted to eat more we can request for more. We did not ask them to cook all the meat on the table as they came on their own initiative to cook and cut for us.\n",

      "When it was time to pay, we were asked to pay 200 baht for leftover meat not consumed and we told them we had not asked the waitress to cook all the meat placed on our table and they just went ahead with cooking the food without asking us.\n",
      "When we asked to see the owner, a lady I assume was the proprietress, just waved us away and walked away like we had committed a crime!\n",
      "I am in the F&B line and this attitude is unacceptable and has no place in a business which genuinely places customer over their own ego. 200 baht is not much money but the way they operate is terrible and i would not recommend this place to anyone who thinks a customer deserves any courtesy and decency from the management.\n",

      "Too bad the food was OK, but the waiters were terrible. First of all, we are tourists in Rome, we don't speak Italian (yes, we understand Italian, but still...). Somehow, the Indian waiter spoke English when we arrived, but when we requested for a dish that was implying a hot stove on the table (extra work for them and the kitchen stuff) he started to speak only Italian with us and denying the order to us. And the Korean lady waitress she refused to bring us the dish that we ordered, saying that she can only do this for 2 people, not for one - all in Italian, of course, luckily we understood. In the menu the dish we asked for was an appetizer and it wasn't mentioned anywhere that it is for two. The roughness of the personnel is not doing your business any good. Smiling? Politeness? Forget about it. The food itself was almost as good as in an average place in Korea. Shame. And the point that was most disappointing was the horrible mess and dirtiness in the kitchen area. Unfortunately, I saw this only after I finished eating, as I missed the entrance to the bathroom and got into the kitchen where I froze: food lying around in boxes placed on the floor, messy and untidy kitchen. I missed the rats, they were probably the cooks there... Bad experience, never again.\n",

      "While visiting Chicago, my friend and I tried this restaurant since it was near the home where we were staying. We came at the right time, as there were only 2 tables occupied by customers. The place looks outdated and is pretty small. We were quickly given water (small and barely half full glasses) and menus. We didn't really have enough time to look at the menu, but ordered anyway. The waitresses quickly threw small dishes of I don't know what on the table and didn't bother to ask if we had questions. This was my first time eating in a Korean restaurant, so I had no idea what all these little dishes were for. Our appetizers came fairly quickly, as did the meat for our main course, which was bulgogi. The Bulgogi was delicious. Our side dishes were not all that great (seafood pancake and dumplings). I needed more water and couldn't get any of the waitresses attention. They didn't bother to come back to check on us at all. It started to get crowded so we decided to leave. We flagged down an older lady and asked for our check and she just looked at us like she was filled with hatred and said nothing, nor did she ever bring us the check. Keep in mind, that she laughed and giggled with customers who spoke Korean to her. I am clearly not Korean (or Asian for that matter). We had to flag down a different waitress who then brought us the check, which was written in Korean. She was a lot nicer, and she brought us containers so that we could take our leftovers with us. Whenever I go back to Chicago, this place will NOT be on my list of restaurants to visit. I will never go back. They really need a course in customer service because the service was just terrible.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I came to this restaurant when it was first open and it was terrible. However after about a year, there was a change of ownership and things improved so much since then. I would say after eating Korean food my whole life, it could use some improvements but then it could mean I am being biased because I love when anyone in my family cooks. I've always been lucky to eat good Korean food. For being the only Korean place in Milwaukee this is the go-to place, even for Wisconsin. I've tried some awful places (ie. Madison). The chef tries his hardest but I think he needs an old grandma back there to make the taste even better because we all know how grandmas generally cook very well. I only come here if a friend needs Korean food or me and my Korean friends need a quick soju fix. Otherwise it is a bit overpriced for me and I'd rather pay money to go to Chicago and make the food myself or go to a restaurant. I am disappointed they got rid of the Hwe Dup Bap and continue to show it on the menu. This is one of my favorite foods. Also I am disappointed the Duk Bok Ki comes in a rice cake that is not 'normal' for this dish and would be most often used in the Duk Soup. Lunch buffets are at a good price for the classic Korean dish.\n",

      "We came to Benu because it had been recommended by some friends who are considered to be foodies and having read raving reviews. We expected a feast. We actually had a horrible experience. First, we were seated 30+ minutes after the reservation time - considering that our reservation was for 9:30 PM - it was very late. True, the staff was apologetic and considerate. But then two happened - we were given the tasting menu as the only choice of the evening . WE found out later that other people were able to order a la carte. Not a fair and not an honest thing to do - of course, the tasting menu was much more expensive. The restaurant HAD to disclose all the options. Then the food started coming. It was not appetizing looking and rarely it tasted OK, at times just disgusting. We were not half through the initial items on the menu when we felt we were almost full but we all had this bad feeling of having eaten something bad. I was nauseous, so was my daughter. Many of the food items looked just repulsive. There were 4 of us and we have very different tastes but we were unanimous - that food is terrible and we will never ever come back here. My daughter felt nauseous for 3 days afterwords and could nog bring herself to eating for the same amount time. Same happened to me - for 2.5 days. Is it a 3 Michelin star restaurant? Wow.... The terrible thing is that I had a friend from Moscow who is a very famous Russian actor - so I wanted to treat him to something very special. Special it was - never again. We were unable to finish eating - we never even got to the main courses - so badly we felt - physically. True, the management charged us not the full amount.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Wow, what great timing for a recent visit to Benu. I didn't realize, at the time, that I would be dining at a newly crowned Michelin three-star restaurant. Benu has been on my radar ever since I read about its inception several years back. About a week prior to my visit to the city, I logged onto OpenTable to see if there were any availabilities at some of the fine dining establishments - notably Saison, Quince, and Benu. I needed something really special since this was my first trip to the city with my girlfriend. To my luck, I was pleasantly surprised that Benu had a cancellation and now had an available table on a Friday night. Previous attempts on OpenTable were unsuccessful for several weeks prior.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main entrance of the restaurant was hidden from its stated address on Hawthorne. To get to the door, you first have to walk through a small tranquil courtyard. We were greeted immediately at the door and shown to our table. The decor of the dining room can be described as classy yet minimalist. The atmosphere was very intimate and relaxed with a very low noise level - perfect for conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only option available at Benu is the 16-course tasting menu. The restaurant, however, is able to make special dietary accommodations with prior notice. As well as the tasting menu, three supplements were available on the evening we visited - sea cucumber stuffed with shrimp, an abalone dish, and a whole dry aged duck. We opted for the sea cucumber, which turned out to be an excellent choice. Parilla (a Japanese herb) and fermented peppers accompanied the shrimp \"stuffing.\" The result was a dish with diverse textures and flavors - definitely one of the highlights of the excellent meal and well worth the $25 extra per person.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the dishes, along with the \"extras\" were fantastic. I could write about each, however, this review would easily become a novel. Thus, I'll highlight a few my favorites. The flavor of one thousand year old eggs can be potent! For me, I have never been a huge fan of them because of this. As a matter of fact, I absolutely hated these when I was a kid. When I looked at the menu initially, I honestly didn't know what to expect from Corey Lee. A small quail egg arrived at the table, and the server doused the dish with a potage. Wow, the intense flavor of the 1000-year-old egg flavor was neutralized perfectly by the creamy potage and hint of ginger. Because of this, I became a fan of this once dreaded egg my mom used to put on the kitchen table!\n",
      "\n",
      "Xiao long baos have been a regular on Corey Lee's tasting menus. On this night, lobster was the theme, more specifically lobster coral or roe. The two \"dumplings\" were presented on top of a bamboo-type steaming rack with a dwelling filled with a vinegar dipping sauce. The dumplings were prepared perfectly, and not surprisingly, the flavors along with the hot broth inside all complemented each other well. A word of warning to those who have yet to experience a Xiao long bao. They are hot, and could burn your mouth if you eat it in a single bite. I've found the key to enjoying these is to pierce the dough with your teeth initially to allow some of the hot broth to seep out of the steamed dough and then chew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the highlight of the meal was the \"shark's fin\" soup. Call me a terrible person, but I've had my share of shark's fin. It's a delicacy that was part of the cuisine of my Chinese upbringing. As a matter of fact, I had no clue what I had at Benu was faux shark's fin until I put two and two together after the meal. I don't know how Corey Lee does it, but he was nearly spot on with the texture and flavor. Take that, along with some Dungeness crab and broth made with house-cured Jinhua ham, and you have a taste of what the Chinese delicacy is all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service at Benu was superb. We opted taking the non-alcohol route this evening due to some potential medication issues. Pretense tends to be the biggest issue with fine dining. I was expecting a little backlash from the staff, since the bar tab or wine pairing is where restaurants make their money, but this was not the case at Benu. Everybody, including Yoon the Sommelier, was so friendly and attentive. The service and environment were so welcoming, it was easy to forget that I was at a fine dining concept and not a ma n' pop type of place! The imaginative dishes bring you back to the delightful reality.\n",

At end of meal, we were rudely advised that leftover containers were not provided, which is fine. But the attitude was terrible. They said the tip was mandatory, and demanded 23%.

      "I had eaten here before many years ago. The experience was okay so decided to return. Upon entering the establishment, there is a very distinct moldy odor. May be some underlying issue there. My mother and I were eating together at the time, but she isn’t a fan of Korean food and wasn’t very hungry, so she just wanted a few bites off of my plate. Waitress seemed annoyed at the fact that we both did not order our own plates and also when we asked for an extra plate and utensils. When I got my soup, it had a small hair in it. It was gross but I wasn’t too fond of the soup so I just ignored it. When I went to pay, the cashier was extremely rude to me after I refused to pay a minimum of a 15% gratuity, which I did not think was deserved. She was being very confrontational and loud and basically trying to force me to pay it. At that instant I got very upset. She had no idea if I was going to pay a cash tip and just assumed I wasn’t tipping at all. I told her to put no tip at all after she started making a scene and arguing with me. She still persisted with trying to get me to press a button, which had a tip varying from 15% to 25% only. At that point, she became extremely loud and made sure everyone in the restaurant was aware of what was happening. I couldn’t believe her attitude and sense of entitlement. She harassed me for a tip for a very uncomfortable amount of time. After getting my receipt and being forced to take a pic of the itemized bill she refused to give me a copy of, I finally told her to shut up and I walked away. At that point she started cussing at me. Totally uncalled for behavior and just in total disbelief that this type of behavior is acceptable against customers here. Will never eat here again. Not sure how the reviews here are so high when the food is not that great and the service is absolutely terrible. Employees have horrible attitudes and treat their customers like crap when they don’t get what they want. There are way better Korean restaurants out there! Stay away from this one!\n",

I recommended to the group, usually a \"safe\" dish, beef bulgogi, it was terrible. I ordered the same thing and no taste at all and very bland.

The kalbi was dry and tough. The rest of the dishes were forgettable...it was a bad food experience you don't want to remember! We eat a lot of Korean food and know what good Korean food is. Sadly, this isn't one of them.\n",

The food is terrible - I saw a non- Korean person in the kitchen and wouldn't be surprised if they prepared the food. I had the hot stone bibimbap that was the epitome of laziness. Traditionally, it needs to have a range of cooked vegetables, an egg, and finely shredded/ minced meat in it. This had very few veges, no egg and the beef and mushroom pieces (this supplemented from my side dish) were too big. I also had to ask for extra chilli sauce as all I got was a smear. The accompanying soup and two of the side dishes were overly salty for my liking. The kimchi was not properly fermented, and the cucumber pickle was not actually pickled. This restaurant is another poor culinary ambassador for Korean cuisine which is delightful when properly made. Don't expect professional service either, the waiter and waitress both had no concept of hospitality. And learn some French, for crying out loud! My search for a decent Korean restaurant in Switzerland continues...\n",

My dining partner and I both agreed that the food was just OK (One appetizer was decent, while the entrees were slightly below average. The soup was terrible and tasted like something out of a carton or a can). This experience was again surprising because somehow this restaurant consistently receives top ten ratings for vegetarian restaurants in all of Manhattan. The atmosphere is cool (prepare yourself to remove your shoes) but the friendliness of the wait staff is hit or miss. I have been to Hangawi a few times over the years because friends/girlfriends are intrigued by the idea of removing your shoes and an authentic Korean atmosphere. Well, let me just say that the restaurant is authentically non recommendable. Our waiter tonight was especially awful to the extent that we honestly thought that he resented us being there. NYC is full of wonderful and amazing restaurants. Hangawi is certainly not one of them despite what you may read online.\n",

Second time according to the opening hours it was open, bit when I arrived it finally turned out that it's closed. Third time we made it sure, we booked a table, we went with friends. Then we arrived and the place was completely closed. Doors closed, no signs of any restaurant... We called the number and he said he is coming just he is a bit late... Okay, we waited, he finally arrived and we could sit down. No apologies, no sorry, here this is normal. Of course nothing was ready so we waited a bit more. We tried everything what he said is available, kimchi, some algae, fried dumplings, fried chicken wings (this two came from the freezer). The quality of the food was good, but the service is terrible. The kitchen and the place itself was messy and dirty. Overall it wasn't a nice experience and we didn't feel like we are the guests or costumers at all... I'm disappointed.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Went last night - terrible - cost a fortune - hardly any food. For 5 of us it cost over $200 - just cooked meat - pork was really piggy and kept me up all night. Big rip off - stay away. I cant believe it cost so much for so little. It looked like the same amount of food was served for the 2 people next to us and we and 5 in our group. No choice of meat - we just got pork. Communication very poor standard. So much for a birthday celebration - so disappointed.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Food terrible, service worst I have ever seen and event felt like it was thrown together at the last minute!\n",
      "Went for their charity night, paid $69. Apparently a cooking class?? We watched a \"food preparation\" display for about 10 minutes but you couldn't hear anything over the noise in the restaurant.\n",
      "We got our arrival drink then canapés, what canapés? We saw these beautiful looking canapés come out but they didn't make it to us! I got half a cold spring roll that was it!\n",
      "Then we went to our tables, 5 on our table, 5 tiny rations of meat come out and I'm thinking this must be entree. Later a tiny bit of salad and then when we're almost finished barbecuing and some lettuce and raw onion comes out to eat WITH our bbq but there's no bbq left??\n",
      "I was horrified, can this be it, we were all still so hungry?!?\n",
      "We were all hoping for a nice dessert at least. We get 2 lots of 4 different desserts each the size of a thumb nail. This is where if I could give them 0 stars I would, the table next to us had 2 people and the same plater that we had for 5! Worse, worse, worse thing is they served this so called dessert with all all our dinner plates and cutlery still in the table, I asked the waitress to clear our table and give us new place and cutlery and she seemed surprised. I looked around the room and people were putting their desserts on their used dinner plates!\n",
      "Oh my god, this place is disgraceful, I will never ever eat here again and I will tell everyone I know never to eat here. I understand this was a charity event but your staff pretty much ignored us focussing on the other dinners and didn't give a crap about all of us who had paid a lot of money to attend this event!\n",
      "This event was a complete flop and I hope other people that attended will be writing scathing reviews too!\n",

      "In my humble opinion, this restaurant has changed my life forever. The second my eyes saw this restaurant, I immediately knew my life would change. I think that this was an example of true love at first sight. The various foods offered at this restaurant is unlike any other. Some people will drive by this restaurant, but that will be a terrible mistake,they will miss out on an incredible experience. The service was super friendly, I became friends with everyone there. In Minnesota, I think that this is one of the best restaurants, maybe one of the best in the world. I am completely bewildered by the fact that this doesn't have 3 michilen stars. I sincerely hope that you can experience this incredible restaurant.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Food is good- service for single person was terrible. I felt invisible as the server would walk past to other tables without checking on me! I will order \"to go\" on next visit. Prices a little steep.\n",

      "I’m not going to say anything about the taste of the food, because it was the 2nd time I was going to Korean restaurant, but it has been a terrible experience.\n",
      "We waited 30 minutes before the waiter came to take the order (we had to call them few times), but it was a Monday night, so it can happen.\n",
      "The real problem it was that I found a BLACK THICK HAIR on my noodles and a piece (1 cm2) of HARD PLASTIC in my main dish (a kind of soup).\n",
      "Once I pointed this out to the waiter he said that the plastic was from a lid and that we were not going to pay for these two dishes, but guess what, when we asked for the bill they didn’t remove the dishes and more over they charged us for 2 bottles of rice wine when we ordered only 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really really bad.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Went to this restaurant for dinner with friends and the look of the shop was good so decided to try. The food is way overpriced for what it is and they charge you for everything down to the side dishes which are usually free at most restaurants. Service was terrible the waiter said they were to busy and asked us to do it ourselves. Food was average and not worth the price. Also where we were sitting was full of bugs and I was eaten alive. Wouldn't go back. Not recommended.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Terrible experience. The service was very disappointing. We waited for more than 40mins for our dish. The rice provided was very hard and it seems like to be the leftover rather than fresh. Because we were unsatisfied with the service, we decided not to pay the service charges. However, the waitor is so rude and said we had to pay because it was written on the menu. I don't believe that's how service charges work. Also in his own words, 'you can ask all the restaurants here. All of them do it'. I don't think that's the truth. Soon after he rephrased that All Korean and Japanese restaurants work that way. I dont believe that's the case although at none of the other Korean restaurants and Japanese restaurants I received such terrible service. Not recommend at all.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This is my experience. It was 6:00 Saturday night and the restaurant was not to busy. We were hungry so we took a chance. My wife and I have never had Korean food, but we were willing to try something new.\n",
      "The menus arrived and it was not easy to navigate everything had meat so we asked the waitress.\n",
      "First of all the waitress could not speak English any of them and there were 4. They had no pics so we had no idea what we were getting. We asked for vegetarian and they pointed to Fresh ToFu Hot Stone. My wife ordered Bul GoGi.\n",
      "They brought out some appetizers which was different but unexpected and not bad. I had to ask a couple of times for a fork finally got it.\n",
      "My food arrived in good time but what I received was a joke. Shredded carrots thinly sliced cucumbers, bean sprouts, lettuce all on rice that was in a stone bowl extremely hot. Mmmm hot lettuce ya as good as it sounds. This was all crowned with 3 slabs of white tofu. This was as terrible as it looked. We had to ask twice for my wife’s dinner.\n",
      "Of the 4 waitresses no one came over to check if everything was satisfactory.\n",
      "The restaurant got busy and these waitresses were constantly bring food to the wrong table. What a joke!!!!.\n",
      "I will never go back but I am not giving up on Korean food. Next time I will try Korea town\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This is a very small but busy restaurant. The food is very good and the prices are reasonable. But the service is terrible. The servers are all young, and all forgetful. After being seated, we waited a long time before anyone came back to the table, even though there are only about 12 tables in the place. In the end, we had to go ask for menus. Then we ordered drinks. I asked for some hot tea. Had to ask twice, even though the table next to us, who came in after us, got their tea almost immediately. When the food came, it was good, but we had to ask for everything even though we had said that we intended to share every dish we had ordered. Please can we have plates. Please can we have bowls for the soup. Please can we have a ladle for the soup. When they asked if we'd like more drinks, we ordered more water and another hot tea. The water came immediately. I had to ask for the tea 3 times but it still never came. I gave up in the end. We didn't have to ask twice for the check though. That came PDQ! Along with 2 mints, even though there were 3 of us at the table. That's what I mean about the service. The staff just weren't paying attention, weren't listening, weren't thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "So bottom line, even though the food was good, I would not go back. Worst service ever.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I was disappointed with this place, the service was terrible and the food was cold. It was a slow day for them. I went with my friend to try for the first time we were the only customers in the restaurant. It took them an hour to make my one sushi roll I ordered and it took them 30 minutes to make my friend's fried rice. Her food was cold and the waiter only came by twice.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Food was good and authentic. Service terrible. We were out of fortune and were waited by the worst of their staff (a man). Slow, unkind. Luckily we asked for assistance to a lovely Korean staff (a girl) and she did her best to make up for the shabby attitude of her colleague\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We have dined here about three times. The first was quite good, the second time was not as good and the third was terrible. A lot of the items on the menu are not available and neither are most of the wines. On one occasion we were even turned away because they had no rice even though there was a supermarket nearby - odd for an Asian restaurant! The service is peremptory at best and the food on the most recent occasion was mediocre. The sashimi were thick slices of salmon and the side dishes were all pickles of various kinds - all tasted bland and of nothing in particular. The spicy octopus was too tough to eat though the sauce was tasty enough. The sashimi was served on plastic rice noodles! The fried dumplings (which were represented as a Korean version of gyoza) were tough with a hard fried crust and contained a tasteless mash of what appeared to be potatoes and peas. The only passable dish was the deep fried tofu which was very tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will not be going back and neither will many others judging by the recent reviews. The decor is tired and stuck in the early 1980s\n",
      "==========\n",
      "This was really average. Cheap cuts of meat, very fatty. The table hot plate doesn't work (all tables) so you get a portable hotplate that smokes and spits fat at you. Really terrible, go somewhere else\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Chose this restaurant based on reviews. Service was terrible, waiter could not answer basic questions regarding adult and child serves for the bbq banquet. Didn't explain who would be cooking the banquet- us it turns out after most of it was burnt by the time they got back to the table. Plenty of wait staff working and at least 4 serviced our table at different times mainly to change the burnt grill plates. Prior experieinces at other Korean BBQ's have been great, this one was awful.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Went for dinner on a Saturday, the food was delicious but terrible waitresses. We explained to the first waitress that we had never been so could she explain how things worked. She basically said you chose a combo or your own dish, it comes out raw and you cook it. The waitress who came and took our order, Shannon I think her name was, she was fantastic, explained the meal sizes, most popular entrees, there would be dipping sauces & lettuce to wrap the meat etc. unfortunately the restaurant got busy so she was not the one who cooked for us. We then had two other waitresses cook, they couldn’t smile if their lives depended on it. If you have no people skills please don’t work in hospitaliy. None of our sauces or our lettuce or pickles etc were replenished, despite them running out halfway through our meal. We were not asked if we wanted any more drinks either. So one drink each was all we had. Yes they were busy but considering they cooked our food it was quite obvious when we ran out of drinks & sides. Would I have Korean bbq again.... absolutely. Would it be st leega..., not unless the staff situation improved....\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We nipped in here on a chance, having eaten several times at a Korean BBQ around the corner which was closed for summer. We had the beef BBQ,. The thick cuts of marinaded meats were delicious. The variety of kimchi offered up was the most expansive we've had, and the tastiest. The HITE beer washed it down fantastically, and the bill wasn't terrible for two. Thoroughly recommend this place if you've had or haven't had Korean BBQ before. Well worth a go\n",

      "I noticed this resturaunt open up a few months ago. Its locale (strip mall with terrible parking) defies its awesomness. After a few months my boss and I decided to give it a try on a lunch break. It was so good we frequent the place at least once or twice a week. As you sit down they bring out several kinds of kimche and some fish noodles or fried potatoes to eat. Delicious. The menu is spartan which usually means the are good at few things rather than mediocore at a lot of things. I have had the pork Bibimbap and the Royal Ramen, both were top notch. The Bibimbap is my favorite (rice, fresh veggies, and spicy pork with a fried egg on top). You stir it all up and you have an amazing meal on your hands. I only give four stars due to the Korean Pop music that is being played on the radio; personal prefrence only. O Cafe is highly recomended.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Truly a terrible place. This is not Korean. It's not food. And it's not edible. Frighteningly bad. Go to any other local place for a mediocre kebab. Still beats the hell out of this. We paid for one dish, not that it was justified. Avoid like the plague.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We wanted Korean food, but the Kimchi Soup was terrible - It clearly tasted like canned food - when kimchi is so easy to do - Nothing tatsted like a fresh food - For this horrible kimchi they charged not less than 300 Rs per person, wich is equivalent to two fresh dishes in any other restaurant - At the ground floor, the terrace is too narrow and didnt make us feel safe\n",

The restaurant was not even busy so that could not be used as an excuse. In addition, we only got two plates of condiments between the 6 of us, where it should of been one between two. We had the buffet. I feel it was a bit over price for what we got. The meat was ok but nothing special and compare to other Korean restaurants I have tried. It does not compare well. The service was average, we felt rushed by the waitress for no reason when we was making our orders. All in all, it was not terrible but it was not amazing. We would probably not come again.\n",

Not only were we served raw meat (bulgogi) which had obviously been defrosted and then left around as part of the meat was raw, which is how it should be, and part of the it was already brown, and it was very cold. It looked so disgusting that we could not bring ourselves to put it on the barbecue. (We told them we wanted to cook it ourselves.)\n",
      "When we complained, very politely in our usual apologetic English manner I might add, we were gobsmacked to be told that because we had ordered it we had to pay for it even though we had not even touched it! When we refused both the owners confronted us and were most unpleasant and quite aggressive. I have never come across this in my life in any restaurant anywhere in the world.\n",

Fried rice is not Korean and if they were trying to make Japanese style fried rice then they put too much water in the rice & was too mushy for a fried rice. The soup was terrible, they put a little bit of miso, then added soy sauce (geez it is so wrong to add soy sauce into miso soup!) & loads of water.

We had seen outside that ther were lunch menu's available, but when offered the menu we couldn't find the lunch menu's anywhere. We had to ask the waitress and she reluctantly gave us the lunch menu.\n",

      "All of my colleages went for the lunch box, whereas I preferred the bulgogi bibimbap. After ordering we got some kimchi side dishes and our miso soup quite fast. The kimchi was ok, not the best I have ever eaten, but not terrible either.\n",

      "After we had finished the miso soup we had to wait a very long time (more than 20 minutes) for our main course. We weren't expecting that, since we had ordered the lunch menu.\n",

      "The menu in itself was fine. It was a pity though that our waitress had the audacity to stirr my bibimbap for me. Really not done! The bibimbap was not spectacular, more meat and vegetables would have been nice. I liked the fact that the bibimbap was served in a hot stone bowl. All in all, the lunch menu is a cheap option, so no complaining here.\n",

      "We heard such good things about this restaurant, we were eager to dine there. However, we never made it because, unless you are in reasonably good physically condition, it is difficult to access. There is a high stone step up and no railing to hold on to or help you up. One person in our party of three simply could not manage it, and so, we just left without entering. So disappointing. I do hope the management will remedy this situation soon as we would like to eat there. Please do not judge by our rating… in order to submit this review, Trip Advisor requires an overall rating… I'm quite sure it is not \"terrible\" as indicated, but we had to punch in something.\n",

The restaurant itself looks swish, what with extractor fans dangling from the ceiling and all, and service is good. We ordered a couple of starters which were actually fairly decent; Korean fried chicken was very tasty, the other starters were good but not excellent.\n",
      "We then ordered the BBQ main course. I personally found this to be a bit disappointing. A couple of very thin beef slices, ok seafood and chicken etc were cooked on the table. None of the meat was special, and portions were tiny for the price, and we still felt hungry after we left. If you want to be full here, you will need to spend some serious money. 'Vegetables' consisted of a tiny bit of mushroom, some onion and some sweet potato. The food wasn't bad, just a bit meh.\n",

I asked about gluten free options and the manager was summoned (not at my request) reassured me emphatically that everything was gluten free. After burning our vegetables to the point of being inedible, I ordered another plate and was only told them as an aside that three of my dishes I'd eaten had gluten. The service had been terrible now up to that point but they weren't even apologetic and the manager just hid. Unprofessional does not even cover it- I am now sick and will be for some time. Avoid this place like the plague- its overpriced, dreadful service and mediocre food at best, let alone a health hazard if you have allergies.\n",

      "The food is over-priced, and the waitress was incredibly rude. I have never been to a Korean restaurant where the meat was as thinly sliced as it was in Koba. The seasoning for everything was off, and they charge an unreasonable amount for items that would be free at any other Korean restaurant. The only thing that wasn't terrible about the place is its design. To top it all off, the waitress was moody, she got our order wrong and counted our money in front of us like a debt collector.\n",

      "\n",
      "Four of my friends and I had dinner at The Test Kitchen on April 8 (we made the reservation in August, this was the first date available, and we planned a Cape Town trip around the dinner as we live in Pretoria). While we were there, one of my friends challenged the kitchen to make him the best french fries he has ever had for ZAR1,000 since we were at the best restaurant on the continent. We were served five chickpea fries in a sauce. When the chef explained the dish, she said she created the dish that night. The five of us then had a debate about whether we were actually served french fries since there were not any potatoes and how we would consider them more mozzarella sticks then fries. The waiter asked for our feedback, we told him about the debate we were having, and he offered to drop the cost down to ZAR300. My friend that made the bet, said no, he said he would pay ZAR1,000 and he will honor that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two weeks ago, I had dinner at The Pot Luck Club and saw chickpea fries on the menu. I ordered them and they were the same fries I had at The Test Kitchen but with different sauces. I asked the waiter about the dish and he said it has been on the menu for about a year and a half, dishes from The Test Kitchen do not transfer to The Pot Luck Club, and that the chickpea fries are prepared a day in advance before they are fried. This means that the chef at The Test Kitchen (who I was told by the waiter used to work at The Pot Luck Club, but no longer works at either restaurant) walked over to The Pot Luck Club to get the chickpea fries, dressed them up differently, and charged us ZAR1,000 for a ZAR65 dish. When I told the waiter the story of the 1,000 rand fries, he apologized and said that is not what the company stands for.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now that I know we were overly taken advantage of at The Test Kitchen, I thought someone in the restaurant group should hear about our experience as well as other patrons.\n",

      "We are foodies and our friends were from Barcelona another great food town.\n",
      "The first 4 courses and amuse bouche were quite good and the confit quail leg was incredible. It went down fast from there.\n",
      "They served a wine called \"El Bandito\" it was absolutely terrible. I was told the taste was peculiar. That is a vast understatement. I had the wine course that was suppose to be top wines. They were OK but nothing great at all. They served a 2003 Syrah that was like 2 buck Chuck.\n",

      "In my view, no. I'm very lucky to live in London so I suppose I'm spoilt by restaurant choice and innovation all year round. I wouldn't say the cooking is that exciting - some of the dishes were interesting but nothing particularly memorable.. We had the nine course tasting menu with the \" up and coming\" wine flight. . The place is very bustling and in my view it appears a better place to go as a group rather than a couple - the smaller tables are not as well situated (2 located on the walkway to the toilets). If you are a couple/single I would suggest you ask to sit at the counter so you can experience the buzz of the open kitchen. Staff are a little manic and the sommelier needs to be more visible ( she didn't visit our table once!). Btw - I read one of the \" terrible\" reviews who ranted on about having to squeeze the butter through some cloth with a wooden knife. For info, the cloth was meant to be removed and you can always use a normal knife! Bless! I think the quality of restaurants in the Stellenbosch area to be far superior.\n",

The waitress seemed eager and took our drink order as we were being seated in a very cramped booth. I ordered unsweetened iced tea. She brought a foul-smelling (swampy) drink. I tasted it, and it was terrible. I did not even recognize it as iced tea. I had her bring me water.\n",

Unfortunately, most of the appetizers were burning hot and wrecked my dinner.\n",

Would definitely recommend!\n",

      "LOLLIES\" This was some of the worst quality chicken I have ever eaten! It was low cost and low quality thigh meat. The amount of fat and what looked like veins was ridiculous, no wonder they make so much money in this place. It was like chewing through un-rendered fat and connective tissue. When I said to the somewhat rude and patronizing waitress how unhappy I was, she tried everything in her power to defend the terrible quality of the starter, hoping I wouldn’t imagine to take it further but I did. I asked for the Tofu starter as I didn't want another awful chicken experience.\n",

After ordering starters from the larger menu, we asked to see the mains and were told that the limited late night menu was only available. The waitress pleaded ignorance on why we were not informed when we started ordering. Following the order of mains we said we would like to order more once we finish what we ordered. When we came to that point we were told the kitchen is closed. We asked for the manager and there a total lack of accountability and ownership. The waitress who served us four times claimed it was not her area. The manager claimed he can't help. Definitely not worth going when the attitude of the staff is so terrible and arrogant.\n",

Nice ambiance upstairs, however we sat downstairs next to the open kitchen, which didn't feel that great. I'm not rating this place on food as didn't eat so can't comment, but my cocktail was terrible. I ordered a 'life's a peach' not really why I expected based on the ingredients on the menu. Gin and tonics had too much ice in them, overall not a great place to visit for drinks.\n",

Having explained to waiter on allergies, and having taken their suggestions on the dishes, none of those instructions were followed through. Food had to be sent back to kitchen 2 times, and still got it wrong. In the end, we were so hungry we picked the bits out and hope for the best. Having told the waiter what they got wrong, he pulled such a long face, and chuck a plate of replacement on the table, which is STILL the wrong item, and was asked to take it back to kitchen. You would expect any food restaurant to take the wrong and terrible item off the bill, but they didn't apologise nor did that. So we had to actually asked for the item to be taken off the bill since it was wrong, and they didn't get it right, and for the optional 12.5 % service charge to be taken off since it was all such awful experience.\n",

      "The starters were very nice.\n",
      "We asked for a small break between the courses which was passed from the waiting staff to the kitchen. We were sat near the kitchen and could see they wasn't happy with our request.\n",
      "Then the main came. VERY salty.\n",
      "I like salt with my food but this was far too much.\n",
      "A BIG thanks to our server who took money from our main meal as he knew it was terrible.\n",
      "But if a restaurant is advertised on national TV with a long waiting list as it has the food really need to improve.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Overall pretty average for what were gastronomically high expectations.\n",

      "I really rate Judy and was frankly really excited; much to my disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of the decor - a great deal of attention has been put in but is a bit of sterile experience in the overall finish. We are talking bills in shells; exposed brick, random 2ne1 additions and screws for chop stick holders. Which, when taken singularly, are fine - but a positively hodge podge as is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was by the book, but also both claustrophobic and belligerent in equal measure. Huge numbers of staff meant you were well \"attended\" to but were allowed little room to enjoy your meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further - it seemed the case that the staff were pained to by there; very uncomfortable indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food - and here is what kills me; I couldn't actually give a hoot about poor service so long as the food is at it's best. The food was terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greasy, flavourless, confused - sure, I understand it's fusion but I've had better street food on the street. I've had better anju in Itaewon, and I've had better tacos from a packet.\n",

      "Further; even by soho standards - 18 quid for 5 dollar soju is not cool.\n",

      "It's terrible place to make a group reservation at this restaurant as the staff are very unhelpful and rude. When I called to make booking the staff said they have table for our group but ask me to write them an email to book it, by the time they reply to my email they said they don't have table anymore, how ridicule! So i called the restaurant again and ask why it happened, the person called M just not answer my question and instead of accuse me rude to him. Very bad experience with this Korean restaurant, so disappointed! If anyone wants to make a group booking, better not go there.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We heard nice things about their Jjam Bbong 짬뽕 (spicy seafood noodle soup) and Chimeg 치맥 (fried chicken wings with beer) so went to try them at lunch time. We waited more than 30 minutes for the food (at lunch time!) and it was the worst Jjam Bbong we've had in London. The soup was luke warm and the noodles were terrible. After tasting it, we decided not to eat it (we know how it should taste as we regular have it in Korean restaurants in London and New Malden, and of course in Korea). Fried chichen wings were cold and tasteless. Overall, much worse than the quality of food at Wsgamama or Itsu. Only the beer tasted alright.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interior was nice but the services were horrible. It is rare to see all of the waiters and waittesses being so unprofessional and unfriendly. It took too long for food to be served. They still wanted to add service charge and we had to complain and told them to remove the service charge.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "There’s a plethora of lovely eating establishments behind Kings Cross but we saw Kimchee and thought that it might be nice to try something new. We were shown to a table very quickly by a very friendly waiter who took our drinks order and talked us through the venue. That sadly was the highlight of our visit. The drinks were forgotten and we had to ask a different waitress to chase them up (having watched several tables around us order and receive their food and drinks before ours arrived.) The crab bun starters were nice but the seafood pancakes were terrible. A thick pancake type batter that had been over cooked with barely a hint of seafood and lacking in flavour. I ordered the beef fillet, supposedly cooked how you like it and served with lettuce. The server never asked how I wanted the beef and when I asked for it to be medium rare he said that’s how it comes. In fact, it turned up well done (and not very nice) and without the lettuce. My friend ordered a Dolsot Bibimbap which is a mixed dish that comes “sizzling hot in a stone pot.” In fact that translated as a dish where the bottom of the dish will be stuck fast to the pot and inedible. All in all a throughly unsatisfactory meal and we definitely won’t go back.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "My coworkers and I recently visited the Kimchee restaurant at Kingscross Pancras. on Friday We arrived at about 19:45\n",
      "\n",
      "This location is close to our office. We have met there at least five times within the past year. However, our experience on Friday was not a positive one. We were unhappy with the cleanliness and felt you needed to be made aware of the situation. All of the unoccupied tables were dirty and littered with crumbs and rice. In addition, the floor appeared to need mopping below the benches. The bathrooms were not very clean as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "We mentioned to one of the Manager standing near ladies toilet, there was no sorry, apology or action, when we went back upstairs, We heard manager sweared in Spanish F##king Asian (puto Asian) really :( hospitality by the manager terrible\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, the restaurant has been clean. We really do enjoy the food at the Kimchee Sp. If improvements are made, we would be more likely to meet there again in the future. We typically visit at least once a month\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Worst service I've ever received. I was waiting for friends to arrive and was asked to give up my table and I obliged. When I had confirmation they were arriving in 10 minutes , I asked for a table again and I was ignored by 3 different people !! Even though there were multiple tables still empty! bearing in mind I had ordered 2 starters and drink while I was waiting initially! I told the staff they were terrible in person too.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Came for a meal at 8pm on a February Friday night. Waitress found us a table by window but after 10 minutes we asked to be moved as we were both so cold and a terrible drought blowing through. Moved to rear of restaurant which was a little better but still very cool. People eating with their coats on and it certainly didn’t make you linger. Food was ok, my friend’s noodle dish wasn’t warm enough although tasty and my salmon/rice dish unremarkable, sauce tasted like the one that comes with Marks and Spencer stir fry deal. Waitress attentive and pleasant. We didn’t stay for post meal drink.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "My boyfriend and I were looking forward to our meal here on Monday but were bitterly disappointed. I had been wanting to come here for a while especially since i had tried another Ban Di Bul restaurant (located in Manchester) which was very good!\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to come during the lunch period as the dishes tend to be more reasonably priced and not too crowded. To start off we ordered drinks - 3 choices we asked for were not available, which didn't bother us too much at this point. We then decided to order the Mandu dumplings for shared starters, my boyfriend ordered the \"bulgogi thop bap\" (Steamed rice with beef and vegetables) and i ordered the \"Kam pung ki\" (spicy fried chicken) with a side order of Kimchi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The orders didn't take too long too come out however on arrival the dish didn't look like the example shown in the menu neither did it look \"spicy\". She assured me it was what i ordered and left. The dish was sweet and definitely wrong so i nicely got up and went to the lady that took my order and mentioned it was wrong and if she could change it. The lady went back to the kitchen and a few moments later came back with the same dish saying \"sorry, we cant change it. The chef said if you do it will be taken out of my pay\". Bare in mind the waitress had written down the wrong order number and not double checked with us before going down to the chef!! We felt guilt tripped and reluctantly side we will make do. The dish was way too sweet and the kimchi that i ordered went terribly with it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Me and my partner ended up having some of the \"sweet\" dish we NEVER asked for and shared his dish. The 2nd waitress approached our table and told us that \"because you ate the meal we cannot refund you\". Absolutely terrible! Not only that but they asked if we would like to order the dish we ACTUALLY WANTED and pay for that on top. Customer service at its worst!! We couldn't wait to leave and will not be back in future.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I went to this restaurant last Saturday,it was terrible experience!! Firstly I had to wait 20 minutes for table and when I received my table I had to share it with strangers. The food was nice but very small portion.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Thought we would try this place as I've never experienced Korean food before. Went for one of the set menu options. Some really nice food, especially the savoury pancake and the fried chicken with spicy sauce. The service however was truly terrible, the waitress forgot our drinks 3 times, brought the wrong food to our table which was then quickly snatched away a minute later when she realised, and it took her 10 minutes to bring us cutlery including us having to ask again which let the food go cold. They then added a 10% service charge on the bill! A shame really as the food was good but the front of house staff really need some proper training.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We arrived around 6pm and were seated quickly and handed menus. After around 20 minutes the waiter come over to take our food order… nobody had even taken our drink order, generally on providing a menu the drink order would be taken. We ordered drinks at the same time as our food. 30 minutes passed and we had still not received our drinks, it was 4 soft drinks, not a very complex order, we asked the waiter for the drinks again and about 5 minutes later he returned with an extra drink which none of us had ordered and therefore sent back.\n",
      "We then waited a further 20 minutes for our food, for him to bring me the wrong meal & again a fifth meal arrived which nobody had ordered. One of my friends and I were really disappointed with our meals, the food was so bland. We had to add chilli sauce to it in order to give it some flavour.\n",
      "We were all in need of another drink but trying to get the attention of a member of staff was quite a problem. People on the next table also experienced problems with the service and wrong orders.\n",
      "As soon as we finished our food we requested the bill, paid and left. I was quite surprised that there was a £6.50 service charge on the bill for such a shocking service. One of my friends paid his part via card, the lady then walked off, we had to tell her that the remaining £50.00 was on the table and she admitted she forgot about.\n",
      "Later that night one of our party had really bad stomach cramps and the following morning 2 more of us were suffering with terrible stomach cramps and had diarrhea. The food from this restaurant was the only thing that we had all eaten the same of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our total bill was around £72.00 which I find very expensive for 4 mains and 4 soft drinks. I feel very disappointed that we paid this much money for a very bad service and stomach cramps/toilet trouble.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Firstly the food here is not authentic Korean. The Korean Noodle with Kim Chi was nothing more than hot water poured over a packet of instant noodles with its powder packet flavour (which I could have done at home for 50p).\n",
      "The Bim Bim Bap, well they got the order wrong as well and we waited an hour for our two dishes to arrive despite repeated assurances that it was on its way. The seafood in the tiny hot bowl amounted to a meagre few muscles, no prawns, squid or anything else.\n",
      "The waiting staff were also embarrassed for the customers and the service was shambolic.\n",
      "The \"instant\" noodles cost an eye watering £11 with a compulsory 10% service charge which was outrageous. There there was only one loo working (one out of order) for the whole restaurant which had not even been refurbished from the previously closed down Peruvian joint. We managed to get way without paying the service surcharge. But overall a terrible experience.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "The food here wasn't Korean prepared, it wasn't good at all. I was gravely disappointed because I love bulgogi with kimchi. The \"kimchi wasn't even seasoned, it was terrible. If you're not used to bulgogi or kimchi then you don't have to anything to compare this against. If you have had bulgogi and kimchi then don't bother to stop here! Do Not Stop Keep going!!! The French fries were good.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I put 2 stars just for the food that was really good! Other than that I rarely write reviews but I am quite disappointed spending a £100 for a meal of 2 for such a terrible service...\n",
      "it really made me so upset the way we were treated. Generally i never spend that amount of money for a dinner so it was a special arrangement. I understand the restaurant was very busy but again I am busy at my job but i try to do it the best possible.\n",
      "We didn’t get any help with the menu first of all. The waitor even made a comment when i was trying to order a premium platter that its a bit pricey (maybe we looked very poor?)\n",
      "Then it took ages to get the drinks. Then the mix platter came wrong. After all that i asked how the table/ self bbq works... and the guy couldn’t help me cause he was stressed out. Then a lady came and asked if we need help? I said yes please! And she said Why?\n",
      "Like ok , i m not going to Korean cuisine to know the deal. Isn’t part of the service to explain the procedure?\n",
      "Anyway i felt super bad and honestly if my partner wasn’t insisting I wouldn’t have paid the service charge. I understand it’s Valentines and its busy but when you spent that amount of money thats not the kind of service you expect. We live next door from the restaurant and definitely i m never going again. At the end before we left the waitor apologised for being so busy.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Good food, well cooked and prepared. We were a terrible mix of veggie, vegan, diary and gluten free! I can really recommend it they catered for us all with a smile x\n",
      "==========\n",
      "We went for lunch with my friends and her 8-month old twins on Friday 17, March. The food was OK but the owner's service is disrespectful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toward the end of our meal, he came out from the kitchen (he was apparently wearing his dirty kitchen apron) and SHOUTEd at us \"could you control your babies?\"!!!!! What on earth he had in his mind treating his customers like nothing. Babies are supposed to be sleeping, eating, smiling and also crying! My friend's babies were just babies with few screams here and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently, the owner has no heart or sympathy for smaller persons. He was all red when he came out of the kitchen and hence he could not even perform a proper communication (a disaster in the making). I told him babies are babies and we are doing our best to take care of them. He could not say anything else and off he disappeared. We were left confused and upset especially my friend who wanted to take her twins out of the restaurant asap. It was a trauma for the mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, the young waiter was saying sorry to us for such unpleasant and unexpected experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the owner did not welcome children or babies, he could have talked me when I called for booking a table. It was the most terrible and unpleasant experience for me and my friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not suggest this restaurant to anyone at all! If you like Korean food, go to Soya in Woking.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "So, the first thing that I need to mention is the location, which is awful. It is in the middle of an industrial estate, in a part of Woking that offers little else to invite you to it, and certainly not for an evening out. Other reviewers have encouraged readers not to be put off by the location, but in my opinion if you don't want to dine in an industrial estate, then you should be put off, especially as the interior of the restaurant unfortunately fails to contradict the surroundings, it feels just like a works canteen in the middle of an industrial estate, or at least a South Korean Industrial estate. And it is the authenticity of the South Korean cuisine which is the main attraction. The food is very authentic. It can be challenging to the uninitiated palate, in some cases very salty and/or bitter but the dishes are various and in particular the k-formal menu provides enough variation to both surprise and delight. The starters were delicious (hairy prawns definitely worth a try) and the large number of predominantly vegetarian side dishes known as Kimchi (essentially pickled veg which comes in a huge range of varieties) contained a number of delicious dishes. and a couple which were more challenging. We made the mistake of both ordering the beef bulgogi, not realising that we could order a separate main dish each despite the K-formal requiring two people as a minimum. This was a double blow, lack of variety and probably the least interesting of the dishes we were served, I don't think the beef was tinned, but it may have well as been.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally the service was charming at all times, I will almost certainly return at some point to experiment with the table top barbecues built in to each table, and the bill was less than £50 for two including drinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It really is worth a visit, but I can't give it 5 stars as the location is terrible and the ambiance is works canteen basic.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Noticed the good rating so we figured we give this restaurant a try since our hotel was across the street. We were very disappointed. $170usd for lunch meal for 3 people. We ordered just the basic Galbi, soup and omelet. Service was terrible as well.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "For few days we were trying different restaurants in Korea, but this one is the worst of the worst! Food is ridiculously expensive, staffs pushing to order extra dishes. Using bowls with cracks. And attitude of staffs are terrible! Very, very rude! Never go to that place, if you want to pay money for hungry stomach and later get trouble with stomach!\n",
      "==========\n",
      "I don't write review usually, so this had really made me feel terrible enough for me to do this, put it straight, this is robbery.\n",
      "Two of us( one is student ) visited on a Sunday, portion is non- exisitence and the seafood pancake literally ( not exaggerating) no seafood in it at all( the only trace of it is a piece of squid which is smaller than your finger nail), one noodle one rice and one of pancake was 33 pounds, and they offer student discount but you guessed it, cash only for the supposed \"discount\", but there's more, suddenly there's a service charge which coincidence is the same amount of the supposed \"discount\" . Oh and no receipt allowed for the obvious reason.\n",
      "I only hoped I read the review on here before I went because they are true to the last words, I write this only to save the potential victims of this scams of a restaurant.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Well we wanted Korean food, but had to wait nearly 2 hours for it to be served! Nearly an hour to order. Starters came half hour after main!\n",
      "There were only 2 serving. The girl said nothing and the man was rude to the ultimate degree! Booked table and arrived on hime but still had to wait ages for it to be ready - even though restaurant half empty then. When some more people arrived the server said \"Too busy, closed now\" and put the closed sign up! That was 7.30pm on a Saturday night. Amazing, never seen that before.\n",
      "The self cook BBQ at the table was really fun and interesting but the meat was really expensive. Other dishes were nothing special.\n",
      "In summary, terrible service, average food and very overpriced. Glad we had the experience but will not return.\n",
      "==========\n",
      "0 star rating. This was the WORST restaurant I’ve ever experienced with terrible customer service. The cashier and waitress were unreasonable. I ordered chicken, which they failed to mention included peanuts (hidden separately on the menu), as I have a severe nut allergy. Instead of offering a substitute meal or replacement, they asked me to eat it or pay extra for another meal. I was forced to pay for a meal that I could not eat. No restaurant has ever treated a customer with a nut allergy so badly. I had a terrible experience and would not visit again. I would not recommend it!\n",
