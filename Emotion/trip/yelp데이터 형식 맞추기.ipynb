They are crispy and the dipping sauce pushes the flavor over the top. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a great variety of banchan. Honestly, sometimes I have no clue what I am eating exactly but it tastes so good I do not even care. The kimchi is fresh and well flavored.  The fish banchan is one of our favorites as well as the potato. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have tried the bbq beef, the beef ribs and the pork belly. We wanted to try the octopus soup tonight but the server said that it was very spicy and my husband can not even handle the kimchi so we opted not. \\r\\n\\r\\nI love soy bean paste to dip in...you have to ask for it...try it out.

Perfect for the hot weather. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut personally I do enjoy kimchi that has more punch both in spiciness and saltiness as I use mine to make kimchi soup and stew too.\\r\\n\\r\\nI still need to try other products Kimchi Korea offers, maybe even their home made dumplings!',\n",
