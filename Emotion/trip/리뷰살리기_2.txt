0 This place is the best Mongolian BBQ with the most amount of protein, sauce, and spice options. They have an awesome bar with even more amazing staff. This deserves to be #1 over any other competitor. Believe me, I've tried all and no one comes close.

1 Here on a Friday evening after a long week and just looking to enjoy a nice meal.. And greeted by a waitress who was not so attentive and not so friendly. Food is great but but could use but could have had a much more pleasant evening if the waitress was nicer!  Server name: Smith

4 Before I start my review, a matter of full disclosure first: I am the contestant for this Genghis Grill's 2014 Health Kwest, a competition to lose weight over 60 days eating Genghis Grill once a day for each of those days. As part of this competition I do get a free bowl for those 60 days and must complete social media challenges for the possibility to win money at the end of the competition, one of the challenges is to complete a Yelp review. I will try to be as fair handed as possible.

This particular branch of Genghis Grill fell under new ownership a couple of months back and they have done wonderful work to update the look of the restaurant and up the skill of its employees, and it shows. The new bar and dining area are tasteful and the staff is excellent. 

Over the past 48 days, I have become acquainted with a number of the staff who know me by name and are always pleasant. Allen, Andrew, and Mike have always been skilled behind the bar and make sure my stays are pleasant and my glass of water is never empty. Arnell and the grill staff are always hard at work and always make sure my bowls are well taken care of and never burned or under-cooked. David, Martika, Hailey, and Edwin have been some of the best servers, making sure my bowls are brought to the table quickly and always greet myself and any guests with a smile and great attitude.

The food here is what you make of it, quite literally. There is a variety of meats from beef and chicken to turkey and calamari. With plenty of seasonings and loads of vegetables the real struggle is to limit yourself so your flavor combination doesn't overpower itself. This is one area of criticism. While some recipe cards are offered at the line, there could definitely be more, showing how versatile a Mongolian stir fry can be. Given the combinations, you aren't limited to just an Asian inspired meal. You can branch out to an Italian pasta dish with pepperoni and red sauce. You can do some outstanding fajitas or even a manly beef and vegetable with barbeque sauce dish. I just wish they had 1) a salad bar and 2) a buffalo sauce so you could make a buffalo chicken and vegetable dish.

My only criticisms are minor and I really enjoy the establishment. And don't let people tell you these places are grossly unhealthy, if you do your bowl right and pay attention, they can be extremely good for you. Even my vegetarian mom loves this place.

5 Better taste and quality then Yc's. However, way over priced and tiny tiny portions. I was seriously confused when I was handed a tiny bowl to put my food it. I wasn't very good at stuffing all the ingredients I wanted into the bowl, but I figured the noodles i requested with it would be more than enough. I ordered it to go, couldn't believe it was $10...got home and realized my to go box was less than 1/4 full. I seriously have the smallest appetite, and 9/10 times have left overs with every meal. I ate my entire to go box, and was still starving.
While the food tasted good, it definately wasn't worth $10.

Oh, and it was super super confusing. One needs to pop a xanax before visiting this place.

6 This is the best Mongolian BBQ in town, hands down... I have tried the others (YC's- was disgusting).  The meat is marinated, and FRESH also they have scallops and shrimp and so many fresh veggies! You can choose udon noodles and many other sides . The best part is the sauces and seasonings that you cannot choose because there are so many great choices! Of course- there is a bar, so even better!

7 To start this is a make your own bowl style Mongolian grill. When I started to create my meal I noticed flys buzzing from each of the meats and other foods. 

After creating my meal the chicken was well over cooked and hardly edible. The wait staff was rude and unhelpful and my over all opinion would NOT come back to this establishment.

8 Had a friend in town from the East Coast. Had planned on something else, but our plans changed and we were near Tempe Market Place so we went for a walk around and ended up here. She'd never had Mongolian BBQ before! 

Seating is a bit cramped, but ok. Our waiter (Travis) was fantastic. To our table really soon after getting seated. Asked if we'd ever been there (no) and took our drink order. Happy Hour (which is all day!) well drinks $2, score! 

He then took us over the main area and told us what to do. I ended up with scallops and shrimp, seasoned with salt, pepper & garlic. Water chestnuts, onions, green onions, cilantro, mushrooms. Sauce was the honey soy. All over white rice. 

Food came quickly and perfect cooked! The shrimp was tender and not dried out. The scallops were tasty too. The best part of Mongolian BBQ is that it is so hot when it comes out to you! Excellent flavor all around. My friend had the beef with the citrus sauce and enjoyed hers as well. 

Best thing is they don't make you decide if you want the all you can eat or one bowl till the end. I thought for sure I'd want all I could eat, but I was full after one bowl. 

I'll be back for sure.

9 Great place to eat after a late night movie at Harkins. They have great reverse happy hour specials Friday and Saturday from 10pm til close. 

It's a great improvement on the whole 'you choosey, we makey' concept. I love how they add the carbs for you later, so you're not standing there with a leaning tower of noodles ready to topple over. Lots of different choices and combinations, but they also have flavor cards if you're ever looking for some guidance.

10 I love this place stopped in the other night on my way home, the experience is always good, but Mike always puts it over the top, always friendly, remembers what you drink, takes care of you.  I think is a different vibe when he isn't there, still a good experience, but not as much fun.  He is a huge asset.   The food is too notch and you can't beat the quality or price.   Just a great experience.

11 ALWAYS love the food.  This location is a little more difficult to maneuver (tons of college kids), but that is ok if you aren't starving and can wait a bit.

Took my 5 year old at her request and we had such a lovely time.  The staff are great and treat everyone well.  Even a slightly hyper kiddo who wants to chat with everyone.

People watching is great, the food is always just what you want, and the drinks are top notch.

12 this place kicks mongolian ass. amazing drink specials ALL day, including 1 dollar mimosas. i felt so bad for the poor bartender though, because he only gets the little bottles of champagne, and had to open like 200 of them in 1 day. 

also, the food is good. they have tons of ingredients that most mongolian bbq's don't have, like eggs, and curry, and steak, and scallops and potatoes.

they don't have a huge noodle selection though, unfortunately. still, this place is a billion times better than yc. 

booze + mongolian = awesome.

i still think it's kind of hilarious that they named a restaurant after one of the most evil people in the history of humanity. where's adolf's pub?

and you can watch jeopardy while you're eating.

13 The food is always good, its just the service that sucks. Our waiter checked on us maybe once and then forgot to put in our order through their fast pay on the tablet at the table. Plus there's the $4 charge to go back in line in case you forgot to put something in your bowl. I've been here several times and never had that enforced on me. Just crappy service.

14 This place is AMAZING!!! Fresh, yes that is Fresh meat, not that frozen/small meat that you get at YC's. The meat doesn't shrink like it does at YC's. You don't have to guess on the sauces and or mess around with making them. Service has always been great and friendly, I think I have eaten there about 25 times in the last year and I have always been extremely happy. The drink specials are second to none. It really bothers me when people are complaining about the price, it is like 10 bucks, if you cant afford 10 bucks for a meal that you are going out for then maybe you should stay in. Also people that are mad about sizes, you do know you can go back up, they are all you can eat for like a couple more bucks, but if you make it right you should never have to go back up. This place is so so good, they are busy all the time, and it is a really fun place to check out. Everyone should go there!!!

15 OK - so an update to my previous post.  After posting my review about a month ago, a member of the ownership team emails me and informs me of changes within the company, and asks me to give Genghis Grill another chance.  I am glad that I did.

Before introducing myself to the manager, the attitude of the staff was 100% different.  Everyone was polite, attentive and really was concerned about the customer experience.  Hostesses, servers, even the guy at the buffet line were all great.  The food was much improved too!  The building no longer smelled like spoiled chicken (one of our warning signs last time), all the food in the buffet line was fresh, and when we received our food, it was cooked perfectly.  

While eating the manager came up and first thanked us for our review, and explained the standards in place, including how they prepared food (a far cry from the previous manager - who is no longer there).  Our food took a little bit longer to cook, but that's a great thing - we knew that the extra time meant (a few minutes) meant the food was prepared properly.

I want to thank AJ, Ash, and everyone at Genghis Grill for the improvement, and restoring my faith in a restaurant that my wife and I loved.  We will definitely be back!

17 If I could give this place no stars I absolutely would I'll keep it short and sweet we walked in and it was super dirty and dirt on the floor dirt on the table and the host did not come up and greet us until maybe 4 or 5 minutes later after we have been told by someone because we got tired of waiting to go back to the front and wait then the service the waitress was absolutely horrid had no enthusiasm act like she didn't even want to be there just kind of shrugged It Off and especially Being our first time there and we told her this then while we were waiting we seen a big cockroach crawling on the back of the couch that kind of did it for it was just a really bad experience if I could give this place 0 Stars I would never going back again and I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.

18 I enjoyed my meal here, maybe not as much as YC's, but enough to get me back if I'm in the area - looks like there are three more locations coming soon, so I'd probably do one of those, since the Tempe Marketplace is always crazy busy.

There was a pretty good sized meat selection, including marinated steak, which I chose. For seasoning, there were some pretty tempting choices, and I went with a couple shakes of black pepper, citrus garlic herb, and crushed red pepper. Peppers, onions, tomatoes, carrots, and surprisingly potatoes went on next, followed by some mongo barbecue, Szechuan, and honey soy sauces, and noodles.

The carrots were maybe a little too thick and crunchy, not quite cooked through, but other than that, everything was all good.

The bowl was a little small (you don't put the noodles on yourself, so you don't need a huge bowl), but I think I managed to get a decent sized meal into it. I probably could have put a little more meat in there, but I'll remember that for next time.

Personally, I prefer the YC's experience, just because it's simpler, faster, and gives you a little more food for a little less money. But I don't have any complaints about this place.

19 Stopped by Genghis Grill the other day with the wife before catching a movie and was pleasantly surprised. The food was great and my favorite part was that the area where you get your food had fresh meat, most Mongolian places I have been to usually have frozen stuff, I forget exactly but am sure they had like 15 or so different meats to choose from. I've had Mongolian BBQ all over Cali and this is the only place I will go to now due to how fresh their meat was. We were in and out fairly quick, which was great since we were rushing to catch our movie. We will definitely be back with our kids and family!

20 This is one of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat. I can build my own bowl, which I like. I usually go in on Wednesday for the $5 sake bombs. The bartender Jesse is always attentive and fun to talk to. Their happy hour is hard to beat. I recommend genghis grill to anyone looking for good food and a great atmosphere!

21 Pretty cool concept, you get to create your own bowl. You assemble into a line and choose your own toppings yourself. Such as the meat, spices, veggies, sauces, etc. You can stack it as much as you can fit inside the bowl (small, regular, large). At the end you choose TWO bases for example fried rice, steamed rice, noodles, cabbage, brown rice etc. And at the very end of the line they cook your bowl on the grill. And you sit down and the waiter/waitress will bring you your food. Delicious! Wide range of endless options for sure. 

My bowl was SPICY and slightly TANGY. It wasn't too spicy btw, just a small kick, enough to enjoy easily :) CAJUN CHICKEN with a little SAUSAGE, corn, zucchini, squash, green onions, carrots, brocolli, salt, garlic seasoning with DRAGON SAUCE. I had it cooked with FRIED RICE and STEAM RICE. 

Good service, manager on duty checked on us frequently as well as the waitress. 

So delicious I would definitely come back! So quick, so filling yummy place overall :)

22 I'm giving this place a 3 out of five because I loved the food,but the service was lacking. This was my first time eating here and I felt that my server did not properly explain everything. She did not mention the booklets they had with recipes you could make, did not tell us there were bowls in the menu that we could order, and did not really explain the process. 

I did not like the fact that you have to scoop the meat yourself because its disgusting. Touching a cold, wet, meat juice infested tong is gross. They should come up with some other way of handling the meat. I felt like they did offer a variety of meats, veggies, fruits and sauces. 

The food came back really fast and it was very tasty.

23 This place is awesome. I am a huge fan of Mongolian barbecues and this place is no exception. The server was ultra friendly, the ingredients looked pretty fresh, and there are instructions for you non-veterans to Mongolian bbq. So after overfilling my bowl with an assortment of goods, I sat down and 5 minutes later the raw food became hot and delicious stir-fry. I'm definitely coming back here for sure.

24 I always come here when I'm craving a good noodle or rice bowl and love the create-your-own style that Genghis Grill offers. You can choose from a wide array of meats, a huge selection of veggies and other mix ins, and several pre made sauces in the self-serve line. I've never had a bad experience here and will continue to return for delicious meals!

25 Really great concept. You get to decide on what you want to eat and every time you can make it different. And you always have leftovers! I will always stop in when I'm at tempe marketplace even if I am not eating, I can grab a ice cold beer or one of their yummy drinks on the menu. When you go in I suggest trying the blue dragon and bring a friend so you can get the fishbowl size! It's a perfect instagram photo! #soyummy #nofishies #thegreatestservers

27 Today I ordered Genghis Grill through Foodsby for lunch. I was super excited for my food since I don't get to Genghis Grill often.

I opened my food and immediately noticed lots of burnt pieces of food. Totally fine because who doesn't like a little bit of char right? Well as I mixed my food around, it was clear that my food was left on the grill too long! I was really disappointed that the taste of burnt food overpowered all their awesome sauces.

Think twice about ordering them for lunch. :/

29 Great Place To Stuff Your Stomach!

The only way you don't enjoy your food here is if you do a bad job choosing your ingredients.

You get to load up your bowl with your meats and other choices and then grab some sauces, choose your starch and they cook it up for you.

I don't remember ever leaving disappointed or with any hunger remaining. 

This is a truly great place to eat!!!

32 This is by far the best place for Mongolian BBQ. I come here every time I'm in town for lunch. Love Tempe Marketplace. It's best if you build your own bowl, but you can use their bowl suggestions.  I like eating the sliced and seasoned beef, the blended seasoning, a dash of cayenne and garlic.  For veggies, I use beansprouts, onions, bell peppers and snow peas. I like blending the sauces (teriyaki, mongo bbq and szechuan). Top off with some fried rice. Good stuff!

34 Last Friday night my husband and I were able to try this place.  We say we want to eat there every time we go to the movies.  Well unfortunately,  IT WAS AWFUL...The counter where you make your meal was disgustingly dirty, my rice was watery and when I got my meal it looked like a bowl of mush....something you would feed a bunch of chickens. I had chosen a ton of veggies and fish,  well they destroyed it during the cooking process.  It looked awful and it tasted worse. I also spent the later part of my evening in the bathroom!  (not just me, hubby too) Never again will I eat at Genghis Grill...I actually thought about calling my bank and disputing the charge. This place is nothing short a high end really bad Chinese food restaurant, you know the  ind where you are eating and you know you will regret it later!!!!    YUCK YUCK YUCK...NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!

36 This place was good.  Typicall Mongolian BBQ although a bit pricey.

The location for this place is really good because it gets alot of foot traffic so you will see this place packed at almost all times.

I like this place better then its competitors in AZ because it caters to the nightlife eaters with Sake bombs and other drink specials.

The selection of meat and vegetables is great and you will find yourself stuck between making several dishes.  I think that if they droped the price of the all you can eat, people would be happier as they would make smaller portions of different things...but right now it feels like everyone crams as much as possible into one bowl.

I recommend this place, but its nothing you have to rush out to right this instant.

37 This is as good as it gets when it comes to Mongolian BBQ.  No cheap meat rolled up and frozen - just a wide assortment of quality meats, vegetables, seasonings, and sauces.  YC's doesn't hold a candle to it.  This is one of only two places I go back to every single time I'm in the Phoenix metro.  I can't wait until a Genghis Grill opens in Orange County.

38 I used to love this place but I've had two bad visits in a row so I'm done. Yesterday 2 out of the 4 people at my table got the wrong starch, one had a very long delay because they'd somehow lost his bowl, another had totally raw egg in their bowl and we all had trouble getting drinks refilled. The prior visit my husbands bowl was served to the table next to us but the gentleman recognized that it wasn't his and sent it away. It was eventually served to my husband although they did offer to let him make a new bowl. Honestly, no one wants to start over when everyone else at the table has their meal. It seems like once they upgraded the decor everything else went downhill. Nothing is quite as clean and tidy as it used to be and the ingredients aren't as fresh. I also was bothered to see the busser wiping chairs and tables with the same towel but I see that at a lot of places...yuck!

39 In short: A lot of fresh ingredients to choose from, and the happy hour ain't too shabby either.

Probably my favorite Mongolian BBQ in the valley.  Best thing I like is the selection, and it's fresh meat not the frozen shaved stuff.  Along with the meats, they have scallops and shrimp, and that ain't too shabby in my opinion.  Then there's a huge collection of veggies , spices, and sauces.  You can play around with the sauces and create some very delicious combinations.  I love the texture of their noodles, chewy but firm.  

Atmosphere is pretty nice and the crowd that comes there is pretty chill too.  I love their happy hour, can't beat one dollar well drinks.  I also like the fact that they are open till 10 or 11 on most nights, perfect place to eat after catching a flick at the theater nearby.  They're bit more pricey than other bbq's but I think it's well worth the extra few bucks.

40 I'll keep it short and sweet for this one...

1) Be very careful of all the raw meats being SO close together! I think I saw some people only using one tong for all the meats... eee!

2) It's hard to gauge how much spices/powders you put into your bowl... so be careful. Sometimes less is more.

Service is alright - you build your own plate, they cook it and then they bring it to your table, don't expect much but have fun with it, I guess.

41 As far as mongollian grill is concerned, this place is the best in Phoenix as far as I am aware.

Hands down, this place has better quality ingredients, better service, and better atmosphere than any other place I have been in that is still in business.

My son loves to go here.  I have to direct him that its probably not a good idea to mix scallops with pepperoni, but he has a ton of fun.  He feels like he is helping to cook, just like at home.

The service here has always been great.  The people are smiling and friendly.

I get the same level of service and the same great food every time I come in here.  I love this place.

43 A caveat to this review is that I love to cook and make my own meal. Guess what; this is the place for control freaks like me. The fresh diversity of meats, chicken and fish; are outstanding! The veggies are very fresh as well. I recommend that you try the sauces first with the little spoons. Here you are master of your own pallet. You can ask them to use less or no oil to make the meal a little healthier. Choose wisely because the portions are as generous as you want to make of them! The owner is awesome and the cast and crew are ubber friendly. There happy hour specials are excellent if your a well drinker. I recommend making yourself a spicy Mongo beef. Use the N.Y strip instead of the sliced beef and you will know where I am coming from!

44 Food was great but our server was terrible. Went with a friend and it was both of our first time, the server made no effort to explain anything or ask if we needed anything even once during the entire meal. No offers for refills until we were done eating then dissapeared to behind the bar for another 20minutes before asking if we needed boxes. 

I would avoid this location like the plague.

48 This place is great I have been here about 5 times. I like my stir fry spicy and they have just enough spices for me to mix in with all my fresh vegi's. You can fill your bowl up with all the fresh meat and vegi's you want and they add your noodles or whatever you want at the end.

The price's are not to bad they are a little cheaper for lunch than yc's and a little more at dinner time but you can get a frequent buyers card.

I love this place and will keep going back as long as it's open.

53 Do not go to this location! Horrible management and rewards program! I have been a Genghis Grill customer for the last five years. First I will say the food is fresh and I really enjoy the mongo BBQ sauce. It's spicy, but very tasty. Genghis is over-priced, so don't be shocked by the bill. Also, paying tip for someone that just brings you drinks is a little hard to justify. This location is no good! Today my table was numbered incorrectly and there was some confusion on delivering my tables bowls. Secondly, being a rewards member I received two emails offering me a two for $25 deal. The manager would not accept the email for the reason that it was only for their arrowhead location. Uh ok. So am I only a rewards member for one location? This is horrible service. After being a loyal customer I feel this deal should have been accepted. So I won't be going there again.

54 This place is very nice and fun. You actually build your own food. In a line you can chose the plate size, meat, veggies, dressings and sauce selection as well as rice or noddles. The staff always help you with recommendations for the best sauce mix and ingredients. At the end you get an awesome and delicious mongolian dish. They also have great choices for food, desserts and drinks. Every table has a tablet and you can order and pay everything electronically. I was very impressed with this system since i never saw anything like that before. Very cool.

55 Great food & service. We tried other places & the competitors. They cannot compare to this Ghengis Grill! The atmosphere is fun. You can feel it in the staff from the bussers to the host/hostess. We can't forget the fabulous bartenders. Mike is the man when it comes professional service & courtesy.  He'll make sure someone is greeted at the door when they enter & he can't get to them. He is always alert to his patrons whether they are sitting at the bar or the tables around. Drinks are mixed & poured as soon as he can  grab & full the glasses.  Even on a bad day he is friendly to his customers.  We love coming here to eat and/or drink.

57 Usually when I go to one of these Mongolian wok type places, I leave with a box and a half to go. On the other hand, this one was more expensive and I was still hungry by time I left. The bowl was tiny, the sides were limited, and the sauces were pre-made, pasty, 'meh'. In addition to that, the service was terrible. My drink didn't get refilled even once, and my friend's food sat on the line for ten~fifteen minutes before they decided to bring it over to her. And the restaurant was pretty much empty other than our table, and two or three others, so it's not like they were super busy or something. There was a group of waiters standing around the entire time, chatting obnoxiously loud and basically ignoring us, while one other girl did all the work. 

Pro's: Fresh ingredients, large variety of FRESH meats (a lot of these types of places do frozen), decent spice section, high quality ingredients in general, clean/pretty restaurant. 

Con's: Way overpriced. Tiny portion sizes. (The bowl was shockingly small to begin with, when I got it. And then it was obviously designed to have a really thick bottom to make it even shallower, as well as a wide brim - which is cheap on the restaurants part, and kind of tasteless, in my opinion.) Lackluster sauces. Horrible service. Oh, and this is more of a personal preference, but they only had udon noodles and two rice types for what you wanted as your 'side', i.e the thing mixed into your stir-fry. Everything else was atypical stuff like tortilla strips and things of that nature. Not to hate on fusion foods or anything, but if I'm going to get Asian food, I'd like more Asian selections, haha. 

These Mongolian Grill restaurants are always expensive. However, it's because you're paying for the fact that you get to eat a huge amount of food. I mean, it's just stir-fry. It's rice and vegetables for the most part. Yummy? Yes. High cuisine? Not so much. Worth sit-down prices? In this case, definitely not.

There aren't a lot of Mongolian places in AZ, but this one is at the bottom of the totem pole, in my opinion. I suggest heading elsewhere.

58 Yum yum  

This is one of my to go-spots for comfort food. 
The whole concept of serving exactly what you want on your plate, with the amount that you want, the spices and sides is awesome.

All the food (ingredients) are super fresh and super broad. 
Staff is super friendly. 
Most of the times I just sit next to the two tvs they have by the bar. Closer to their draft beer ha!

In general I highly recommend this spot, it gets busy during Sundays so show up early for their happy hours.

Enjoy!!

59 I love the wide variety of meats and vegetables they offer. Sometime the chicken looks very fatty but then i just load up on shrimp.  The sauces are amazing and all the spices......im in heaven. Did I mention that you can get an egg mixed in with your stir fry.  You give your bowl to the hair net man and tell him what carb you want brown rice, noddles, white rice. tortillas.  
I like this place much more than YC's because there are so many more options...

61 This is a great place for wonderful Mongolian. I used to eat at a Mongolian place back home and nothing here compared till now. Our server was amazing and very attentive. The meat was tender and marinated wonderfully I was concerned with the one sauce cup. I got 2 meals in one with all the leftovers. Definitely coming back! Hope to have the same experience.

62 My wife and I used to come here and loved it. But over time, it's had a steady decline. While they have improved the decor, the food is not what it used to be. The past three times we have gone, the meat seemed to be substandard, looking pale, old or outright spoiled. Toady we walked in to the smell or spoiled chicken. Against our better judgement we stayed.  The sirloin looked oxidized, brown and as it had been out since yesterday.  And to top it off, they have turned up the grill high so they could cook faster. This lead to burnt food that was either overlooked on one plate and undercooked on another.

We're disappoint because we used to love this place. Not so much anymore. We probably won't be back and can't recommend it.

64 This location is horrible! One its winter and cold as heck inside with all the fans going full blast, two there's nothing like gangster rap music playing loud as hell, then to top it off almost all the food bins were empty. We ordered our water and lemonade and only waited 15 minutes for it and the place was 20% full. This is one location we will never come back to plus it was pretty dirty around food area. Not sure why we even stayed

65 I eat here all the time and it always seems like something's changed when I go lol. I have a fail safe for a delicious bowl. They no longer have the sauce available that was my favorite. The small, med, large bowl option change is something I do not like because now I have to spend more to get what I was getting before. They do have a great happy hour and nice staff. I do enjoy this over YCs because the food is FRESH. Once it is cooked it makes a difference joy being cooked from a frozen state. Also they have more options for protein.

66 I just had a horrible experience at Genghis Grill I was there with a friend she ordered a burger with bacon on it it came out the bacon with majorly undercooked they said they would bring her some crispy bacon when the bacon arrived it was still undercooked. I'm saying is if they're under cooking their food someone could get sick. I ordered pot stickers that were cold when they came out an undercooked too.:(:(:( We did make the management aware but this situation still ended up unresolved . I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

67 This place used to be my favorite place to eat in the valley back in 2013, but ever since a few years ago, the quality of the place has certainly dropped. The restrooms are disgusting, moist, and the hallways and floors are dirty. The prices have increased as well since then and the new staff seem to be confused to what they are doing half the time. 

The only great thing about this place is the food. It's definitely delicious. The prep area is kept clean and there is a little cross contamination, but nothing too severe. If anyone is allergic to anything, they'll accommodate you quickly.

71 Random visit as I was shopping at the Tempe Marketplace and Asian cuisine was on my mind! The original location I visited was years ago at the paradise valley mall area, which has since closed. Good to know this establishment is still around ! I love how you can make your own bowl and smash as much as you like to appease your cravings. I honestly don't quite remember what i mixed in my medium bowl besides the main ingredients of steak and scallops.
I do know I added garlic , greens if some kind and had to have an egg mixed with my fried rice as the chefs go to work frying my concoction to this meal you see attached ! Great to see that genghis is still around !

We sat in the bar and Mike was the most amazing bartender/server weve ever had at Genghis. From now on when we go in we will be looking to sit in the bar if he's there. Thank you Mike for a great preshow experience.

74 I've come to the conclusion Arizona has no idea what the mongolian experience is supposed to be like.  But this place is the best I've found so far.

basically you pick the ingredients from a buffet style set up, and then they cook it on a huge open range.  Lots of meats, veggies, and spices, and a decent selection for the vegan/vegitarian crowd.

its a little pricy, about 9 bucks for a single bowl and 15 for unlimited trips, but compared to the rest of the mongolian rip offs around town this is the bee's knees.

And for the people concerned about cross contamination, its all cooked after you make your selection so raw meat touching the veggies doesnt really hurt anything.

75 Last night was an epic fail on the service side of things. So apparently Erica (not sure of spelling since she never came back) was near her end of shift and decided to just leave us in a lurch, which meant our drinks were empty the majority of the meal and I had to get a manager to figure out someone to bring our check so we could just get out of there. Thanks for the crappy birthday meal experience.

76 Agree with a review below about changing to different bowl sizes and what not does seem like they're trying to nickel and dime you. You make your own bowl so if you don't like it,  it is your fault. Never had a bad time, try a fishbowl great drink for two. Though new electronic check out is annoying. Takes up to much room on table when with four people, and the servers dont have much to do with it being a self service.

77 We met here for lunch.  First of all there were no shrimp. Then we made our choices,  between the coming stone and our table,  our meat/ fish choices had disappeared and then we got bowks that were not ours.

I bring my friends here and recommend everyone give it a try. The best part is you can't mess up your meal because you make it, if you don't have a clue what youre doing you can just grab a card off the wall and go.

82 Genghis Grill is an awesome spot for the authentic Mongolian grill experience. Fresh meats, seafood and vegetables make this new chain far superior to YC's.. The biggest difference is that they suggest to put the sauce on last, which gives the food a far better flavor. 
(it burns off any other way) you would think YC's would have figured that out over the years.
Genghis also features a full bar with include a daily sake bomber special. Definitely worth checking out!

83 I took my daughter and son out to eat here, which is rare as going out is a treat for us.  Usually I feel like an inconvenience when I am out with my kids but our waiter Mike was extremely friendly and attentive. He helped instruct both kids through the process as a build your own bowl dining experience was new to them. He also checked on us often and made our experience very pleasent.  The food was great, the atmosphere was fun and the service was fantastic. We will be back.

84 Food is good!!! It's like a YCs type deal, but I actually prefer YCs a little more, as you can add more noodles and things to the bowl, as compared to Genghis, which limits what you can put in the bowl. Then they will trim down the amount of starch they add  for how much you have added to your bowl. Overall good experience and decent food.

86 I returned to genghis after a pretty poor customer service experience the first time. This next round was significantly better, and I am happy I returned. My only gripe was that they had no shrimp, and I was pretty bummed because my mouth was watering for it. The service, though, was my chief complaint the first time and my server was definitely an upgrade. Not outstanding, but an upgrade. Enough so I will be returning.

87 Just tried to go here for dinner. We were seated quickly since it wasn't busy, yet after 10 minutes we had to ask one of the waitresses to have our order taken. She said she was going to get our server, didn't even ask if we wanted drinks. Whoever was supposed to serve our table never showed, after another 5 to 10 minutes. Ended up leaving and going elsewhere. There's plenty of other places here in Tempe marketplace.

89 Genghis Grill (in case you haven't already realized) is a mongolian grill.  You get a bowl, go the buffet line, put various meat/veggies/sauces in the bowl.  Then, you give it to the grill person and sit down.  As others have said, you don't wait at the grill - your server will bring you the food after you sit down (unlike the ubiquitous YC grill).  I would say the quality is better than YC.  Probably because the food is fresh rather than frozen.  Variety is also superior to YC - you have the usual fish ad pork, but you can also add various steak options, scallops, fish, and squid!  Awesome.  Lots of veggie options, and you can add egg(s).  The sauces are thick and flavorful.  It's also nice that you can pick from rice in addition to noodles.

My main complaint?  The portions are way small.  You can order all-you-can eat, but it's an extra $4 (maybe even $5? I don't recall exactly)...  I'm sure this is a cost-saving tactic, but jeez, stingy.

90 I used to go to YC's all the time but this place has been replacing it. I am not sure why... maybe the $1 sake during happy hour?

Anyway, today there was a special for $6.99 bowls so my friends and I went. There's a variety of ingredients like bacon, sausage, pepperoni, chicken, beef, scallops, calamari, white fish, etc. Then there's the veggies and then the sauces.

The portions are definitely smaller than YC's. I still managed to get a pretty good amount of food into my bowl. At YC's, you have a bigger bowl and it's easier to smash everything into it. Here... not so much. But I found a way around it. Build a wall with broccoli and essentially make your bowl twice as big. It's a work of art and architecture in the end.

Sauces and flavors are good. Variety. Nice place to hang out with friends. :) Just make it work your buck. Pack it in!

92 This is the first time ive ever had a complaint about the food here. It came back super burnt. I pointed it out to my server and all she did was offer to have them pick out the burnt food. No harm no foul. Im sure it will never happen again.  That being said the staff and atmosphere were amazing as always. Their bartender Mike was as attentive as always. I must say one thing they've done right is having Mike there.

94 I really wanted to love this place but I cant. YC's is a much better deal. 
Smaller portions, higher prices, drinks not included, no extras like soup and frozen yogurt and a server that you need to tip for not doing much of anything. Bleh

If I'm going to stand in line and create my own meal, let me wait for it and carry it to my table so I don't feel obligated to tip.

Nice selection of meats and noodles, sauces and spices - but I would never choose this place over YC's. Tried it 3 x's and just don't like it.
They do serve alcohol here so that is a plus.

96 I used to love eating here. Now they have all these changes and it's not fun anymore. For instance, if you are in the food line to pick your stir fry ingredients, and go back to an ingredient that you've passed prior, they will charge you $4.00.
I saw a lady get charged when she went back for a teaspoonful of chicken for her kid. It was not fair. They really need to look into these stupid rules cause people are getting irritated and just not going back instead of complaining.

99 When you walk into Genghis grill, they ask if you've ever been there before while they assemble steel bowls.  Yes, of course I have, I answer as I'm led to a table and I order drinks. Then I take my battered little bucket (you feel like a Unicef kid for a minute) and head to the assembly area, and here is where Genghis Grill outshines their competition.  The quality of the meats, seafood and vegetable is clearly a cut above almost every other Mongolian Grill type establishment.  Since I don't eat meat I put some shrimp and scallops in the bowl, and assemble my favorite mix.  I do not recommend cramming too much meat into your bowl -- a juvenile mistake I see made by kids with bad skin and future cardiac issues.   Take it easy on the sauces since they are laden with sodium and oil.  You will be pleasantly surprised at the volume of food that your bowl + rice/noodle mix will create.   Friendly staff and a decent selection of beers.  As others have noted, it can take time to get your check and get out the door.  In noting some other reviews I think I think it would be helpful for Genghis Grill to really emphasize that overdoing the sauces will just destroy your meal.

100 Great food. the meat is all fresh and not frozen then shaved to little protein flakes.  Twice the variety of yc's, including shrimp, calamari, steak, marinated whitefish and all the veggies you can think of. Best happy hour anywhere. The 1-5 specials are ridiculous.  YC's blows genghis!  play your cards right and you can leave full, buzzed, and with a golf lesson for less than 20 bucks! hooray for kitten mittens!

101 Service is not good. The food tastes flat. The ambiance is somewhere between a sports bar, a mongolian BBQ and a cheap chinese restaurant. The drinks are not good and prepared by non-professional barmen and barwomen. I had to ask for the bowls to be replaced because they were dirty and the waitress didn't see anything wrong!!! For the same money I can have better food across the street at Pei-Wei.

104 I was only in Arizona for the night, and I'm not sure if this is a chain because I haven't looked into it much but this place is golden. I wish we had one in Cincinnati!! 

Pretty much set up as a chipotle style Mongolian grill. You fill your bowls, don't let that small bowl fool you, you can pack as much as you want into it and when it is cooked, it's served in a bigger bowl. 

You pick out your proteins, veggies, and sauces all buffet style. They even have spoons on the line  to try the many different sauces they provide. 

Basically if you love a good noodle bowl that's freshly made, this place is where you need to be. 

There is also a full bar to enjoy if necessary. It's also located in a beautiful location, surrounded with tons of places! When I go back, I will be here!!

105 This place just does not feel clean. We walked in at about 8:30pm for dinner. We were seated right away. When our server came, she took our drink orders (good looking drink menu by the way) but failed to explain the ordering process. When we asked how to order our food, she pointed to the line and explained that we fill a bowl ourselves with what we want in the stir fry, then circle what kind of rice we want on a little card. We walked over to the line and were handed a tray with a stainless steel bowl for the create your own stir fry. The tray felt sticky. Gross. The meat section was first, and there were pieces of raw chicken that people had dropped in a bunch of other containers. Then I witnessed the man in line in front of us use his fingers to push the ground meat off of the tongs and into his bowl before returning the tongs back to the tray of meat. No thank you. The carrots looked like they'd been sliced days ago, all soft looking. Ultimately I put my tray back and decided not to dine here. Will not return.

She picked up my order and  when she brought it home I could not tell the difference between my full meal and her leftovers! She had more leftovers than I had in a full meal! My full order was literally only 1 cup! It barely covered the bottom of the container! As I started to eat, I get a call from Genghis Grill. The person who I think name was.. Mike.. apologized and said my order got mixed up with somebody else's take home!  I could not believe it... I was eating from someone else's mouth!

116 Walking in the place looked nice, but I was soon mistaken because as soon as you get passed the bar, that's when all the horror comes out. We got seated, and grabbed our ticket (WHO USES A STAMP CARD THING? ). 
After we walked through a tiny walk way to get to the back where the buffet line started it was filled with an atrocious aroma of smoke, and heat.
Grabbing the food items looked so unsanitary. The food itself sat in the juices, like they all came from a can. With everyone in front of you touching the same slimey utensils i almost wanted to walk out. The meat was not refrigerated, and was leaky. I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt - regardless of everything my date and I experienced this far. The sauces were pre mixed, and even though you had a variety to choose from, with more than 1 cup to put it in, I still was not satisfied. They were definitely packed with sugar! 
Everything seems regulated, even down to not allowing for customers to pack their noodles in their bowl, which I personally go HAM on! 
When it came time to eat the food it was sooooo grease filled! Not what I expected at all. 

It's also hard to enjoy your food when the employees are constantly bashing their trays, bowls, and other Instruments on the floor when they're done cooking 1 bowl. 

All in all I would say this is not worth the price, time, and a review of 3 or more stars. The extra star I put on there was because of the nice waiter we had. He never let my cup go empty! On that note...try the peach sweet tea!!! Yum! 

Spend your hard earned money at YCs instead!

U come in, get a little card, go to the food part, someone fills the card out for u and u just go through the food line and add what u would like in ur bowl, for example i got cajun chicken, broccoli, pineapple, bean sprouts, added some cajun seasoning as well as lemon pepper, added some teriyaki sauce, and at the end u get to pick if u want noodles, fried rice ect, then they make ur bowl and it gets brought to u. It was delicious !! Worth it all the way!! Everyone was also very friendly! If u haven't been there they wont hesitate to help u!

119 I usually have a hard time giving restaurants 5 stars. However here at GENGHIS GRILL that's not a problem. The meat options are the best in the state as well as the quality. They have pretty much every veggie you would want to add to a stir-fry bowl and the sauces are amazing. I always feel like I am well taken care of here from the refills to the way I am treated when I first walk in. GREAT JOB GENGHIS. You earned this five star rating!!

121 So 5 years later, we came back and was really looking forward to a great night out with friends. Sadly, the owner of this place really could care less if you visit his place. Sadly, the employees are the ones that suffer.

On a scale of 1 to 5, common courtesy of the staff is a one. Our server, did not explain exactly how their system worked in the ordering of the food. We waited in line, when we got to the staff member with the tray and bowls, she asked for our card....

In order to get your food your server gives you a card, ours did not. The staff member made us get out of line and go back and get our cards. This seemed quite ridiculous, I suggested that we just fill out new cards.

The food was great! The service was terrible, the response from the owner was surprising as he acted like he could really care less about our experience. The whole point of going out, is the experience, it is not just the food. There are so many great places to eat in Tempe that has great food and offers a great experience. This place does NOT do that.

Noddles is the way to go for sure. It was fast and easy and tasty! The service was good also. I strongly recommend it. It's a more casual and fast version of YC's. My favorite part is you drop off your bowl, then go to your table they bring it when it's cooked!

125 When it comes to the food 5 stars. No questions asked, always good. 

As for the service....every time we come here I get disappointed. I drop to my knees outside and pray that once, just this one time, I'll get decent service. Nope. Kick in the nuts. 

Thoughts:
One, Maybe have more than one POS system for your servers. Could help. 

Two, hey server guy, you got me a water. That's it. The whole meal. A single water. Not a refill, for the one water you brought me, which was empty for ten minutes. However, had you seen it empty it had taken you probably 5-10 minutes to refill it, this being based on how long it took you to fill up the Coke for the table next to us while you sat behind the bar and talked to the rest of the staff. Our food (once again always delicious, mix the 3G with the Thai peanut sauce, it's amazing. Recommended by another server, I think his name was Steve, that guy is probably awesome, I assume he drives like a cool truck and volunteers at some charitable organization) back to our food, you didn't bring us that, another server did. 

So, in a matter of 30 minutes our server came by twice, once to bring me a water and the next to ask, Check? Well, my food is gone, my water cup as dry as the Sahara, and I've resorted now to downloading and playing some iPhone game about breaching a beach. I'm on level 100 because that's how long I've had since you last stopped by to check on me. Yeah....check. 

I try hard to not be mean, but I served for a long time and I know it's not an easy job, but it's not that hard. Especially on a Friday lunch shift. And last, after you ask if I want my check could you not stop by the hostess stand to flirt and just bring me my check? I have to make it to a movie and if I miss the previews and most likely a new Melissa McCarthy movie trailer, so help me god. 

So, after all this, will I stop coming. No, dammit no, because that sauce combo with udon noodles, shredded beef and sausage is just too damn amazing. And I always hold on to the small chance i may see Steve again and get a new recipe recommendation. Long live Steve.

126 I have been coming to this location for about 4 years now.  Always a great place to focus and get homework done or just relax with dinner. I love the fact that i can have a different meal everytime i go in! I can switch meats , veggies, sauces on what i wanna eat that specific time, with the base of fried rice, noodles, rice noodles, cabbage , the list goes on. Their happy hour is great have Monday-Friday 3-6, $2 wells, mimosas, beers, sakes, you name it! And then a Reverse happy hour Sunday-Thursday 8-close. The meat is always fresh and the cook Alex did a great job on my bowl. Very flavorable and perfectly tempted. I always sit at the bar though with my favorite guy Michael. He is so down to earth , very professional and easy going. You'll definitely want to eat and drink with him. My whole family has been here with him by now! Great place to eat guys. Will always be a favorite. Without Michael i can definitely say, my visits wouldn't be the same and i would be a disappointed customer not seeing him around for whatever reason.

133 We were looking for a good place to eat a quick meal on a Sunday night and we walked into Genghis Grill. Mike the bartender greeted us and asked if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered 2 beers and an iced tea and then proceeded to the line to create our bowls. The line was pretty quick and there are so many options for meats, vegetables, and sauces. Then you get to choose a side for your bowl too. We got back to our seats at the bar and our food came pretty quickly. Mike was very attentive and refilled drinks very quickly. It appeared that it was just him and one other person working but we never were forgotten. If you come into Genghis Sunday through Thursday you can find Mike at the bar. Guaranteed to be a good time.

136 Food was good. Service was sub-par. The gal behind the bar today had a real attitude. At one point there were customers trying to get her attention, I said mam, excuse me she looked at me and I told her these folks are trying to get your attention. She looked at them and said I hear you I will be with you in a minute. If you Hear someone acknowledge them, or go sit in a cubicle somewhere. If you're that bothered by a customer that was not being rude they weren't for sure if you heard them, then you're in the wrong field.  It's sad to see we get this desperate for help now that we allow people like this to interact with customers. This is the type of thing that customers won't come back again over. Thanks to the gentlemen at t lie grill. They did an amazing job and helped us with everything and cooked to perfection. Unfortunately the rude service has to kill the review.

137 Being a lifelong YC's patron, my interest was piqued when I saw there was another Mongolian bbq restaurant in Tempe.  To short-cut to the differences between the two, Genghis Grill:

-Has smaller bowls, so smaller portions as a result
-Has more selection, with more expensive types of meat and veggies such as bay scallops, calamari, and snow peas
-Is about $10 for a single bowl
-Has thicker, sweeter tasting sauces that have to be mixed in after the food is cooked (Otherwise they burn due to the sugar content).  With YC's, the sauces can be directly ladled onto your bowl and are cooked with the meat and vegetables.
-Offers alcoholic beverages, and has a cheap happy hour (Which I have yet to try)
-Does not have any free range soup or soft serve with your meal.  Drinks are provided by your server, rather than a free range soda fountain.
-Servers bring your bowl to your table, rather than waiting at the counter
-Does not offer you any waxed paper to push your meat/vegetables into the bowl so you can maximize on bowl space

Since the price is the same no matter what you get, I loaded up on seafood, getting a mix of marinated fish, shrimp, scallops, and calamari.  I got some veggies, 2 spoons of spice mixture, and a mix of szechuan, Khanzu, and ginger-citrus sauce.  While the combination tasted good itself, the thinner cuts of seafood ended up being done faster than the larger cuts.  As a result, the scallops and calamari tasted tough and overcooked while the shrimp was cooked just right.  

Service was friendly and attentive.  While I do like the bigger selection of items to choose from, I like the thinner, less sugary sauces at YC's and the bigger bowls.  It's a tough call, but I would say, if you want more seafood and higher quality meat in general, go with Genghis, but the better deal will be at YC's.

138 The girl who greeted us was kind. Then I had to figure out how it worked on my own. Then walked to the begin,explained the size bowl. Small is extremely small. Pricy for a small. Then load as much as I can in the tiny bowl. The people who toss your food to cook are rude,half fell off,who cares I'm just paying $11 for a tiny bowl. Then you just have to figure out what to do next. Do I wait?? Guess not. Go sit they will bring to you. Ok my food was great but I selected it so that was expected. Some things I didn't have in my selection were in my food??. Fiery hot peppers..no thanks. I'm probably not coming back. I'll stick with. YC's get more food for less and they guide you with manners.

139 My friends started out here for a birthday celebration.  It was our first time.  Mike was our server, and what a server he was.  Funny, efficient, good recommendations...Food was really good.  Best happy hour anywhere for sure.
The experience was so nice, that we went back for their 10pm happy hour again...Mike again served us, and really made it special for all of us, particularly the birthday girl...I believe this is our new spot.

141 This place is so good. Get a table, then get in line to grab a bowl and a tray. Once you have those, you fill your bowl with all ingredients that you want in your stir fry, and you hand off the bowl. They then bring it out to you. 

If you do it right, this place is a better option that YC's. For me, I like to stack the meats, and I definitely get my money's worth. If you like more of a balance of veggies and noodles, then YC's may be the move. 

Either way, food tastes great (sauces better than YC's, and more variety) and the staff was great. Can't wait to go back!

144 Ghengis is amazing! Used to come here all the time for lunch but then I switched jobs so this was the first time back in a while. One thing I noticed is that bowls seem to have gotten a little more expensive, $13 for a small bowl&  almost $15 for a big bowl. Crazy. But the concept is still great, love putting together your own bowl.

145 This is my favorite Mongollian grill restaurant in Tempe! The first time I came here was two years ago after work for happy hour with some friends, and I've been coming back ever since. The food selection is awesome and they generally have a great happy hour special going on. The staff is friendly and attentive. Whenever I want to get creative by customizing my bowl, they always offer helpful suggestions. My favorite thing on their menu is the chicken lettuce wraps and the frozen margaritas (that come in lots of different flavors!)

149 This is unfortunate.  I have been to some of the other chain restaurants and they were wonderful.  This was our second time.  The first experience wasn't nearly as bad or we wouldn't have come back but now it's time to warn others.  1st this is not cheap.  The small bowl is $12.49, reg 14.49 and large $15.99.  To put that in perspective, my husband and I typically share meals.  Here, he gets regular and I get small.  The wait staff is attentive and friendly enough.  You may wait a little, but nothing terrible.  The buffet bar itself has food everywhere.  Several items that are dropped in the containers of food.  Which is understandable.  But there is no one maintaining it.  There are several men at the grill and the area is filthy.  One guy was pouring a bucket of dirty dishes into another bucket on the floor.  A couple fell out.  One of the cooks stepped away from cooking.  With his gloved hand, picked the bowl up off the floor, tossed it in the bucket that is on the floor and then stepped back to cooking.  It was mentioned to the guy who asked us for sides and he did ask him to change his gloves.  Trying to eat lighter I got the chicken.  It was so spongy (assume fillers) and had so much fat and connective tissue still attached, I couldn't eat it.

151 The food is good , the price wasn't bad at all 40$ for 3 people, we got 2 bowls and a alcoholic drink . We got 1 medium size bowl and 1 large bowl. The large bowl can easily feed two hungry monsters. Everyone that worked there was nice. However they definitely need to hire more waiters. Our waiter service was not good at all. Other than that I would go back.

154 Came to Tempe Marketplace with the family and decided to grab a quick meal before our movie began. It was our first time eating here, and the waiter was very kind and explained the process of ordering (you can either order one of their signature bowls or customize your dish by filling out a card and taking it to the stir fry line). Since we didn't have much time, we ordered the Chicken Teriyaki, Mongolian Steak, and Sesame Beef signature bowls. 

It didn't take too long to get our food, but I was a bit surprised by the relatively small size of the bowls. Nonetheless, the Chicken Teriyaki was tasty with a little kick of pineapple. The dish was a tad oily, and my family also commented on the oiliness (is that a word?) of their bowls. I personally believe that the price ($10-$12) is too much for the small bowl, but the patient waiter and good family time made up for that. 

In the future, I'd like to try customizing my own bowl!

155 This has been my favorite place as a go to when in tempe since they opened! It's convenient if your an omnivore, carnivore, herbivore, vegan, vegetarian, and pescatarian! Anyone can eat here. 

The service is always amazing here and as quick as it gets for a place that's constantly packed. 

The good thing about this place too is you can literally always try something new for exactly the same price. You also don't have anyone but yourself when you're food isn't that great (it's always great though). 

A few of my favorite sauce combos:
If you like it spicy try the Cajun seasoning with dragon sauce 

If you like it garlicky try the garlic sauce with garlic salt 

If you like it spicy and tangy go with the kangpoa 

If you like it sweet to with teriyaki and sweet and sour sauce. 

If you're trying to be healthy instead of rice or noodles go with cabbage (what u always go for). 

There is quiet endless options here. You can never go wrong. My favorite is the Cajun chicken and sausage! I always get those. At dinner time I always throw in some shrimp. 

As you can see I can go on and on about this place and how good it is but the only way to really know is give it a try yourself!

160 It's 14.49 for a regular bowl the small bowl at 12.49 is too tiny for most 
 people,you pick out what you want in meat,veggies  and seasoning ,they fry it up,it's sort of a buffet line.It is okay but certainly not an inexpensive meal ,tasted okay but I see no reason to go back.They give you a choice of pasta or rice ,it will fill you up.Not for a tastes but it is worth giving it a try.

161 Honestly I never am one to complain, but this place is horrible! $12 for the smallest bowl of food ever. On top of that the set up is unorganized.

162 I love the concept of genghis grill, and after messing up at YC's with too much sauce and seasoning, I was very careful. I really like how the protein is fresh, not frozen, and they have many different options. I mainly stuck with chicken and steak, and really piled on the veggies. Lots of options! I also added noodles/rice and sauce and seasonings before lettin it sizzle while I went back to table to have my drink already there. (Great happy hour specials) When my food came it was a huuge portion!! It was absolute perfection! Also scored points for the sriracha:). Plenty of leftovers, and one happy girl means I will be back:)

164 I meet my daughter for lunch Tempe Marketing and she had one of those noodle cravings. She wanted to go to GG and I haven't been there before so I'm always willing to try new places

Walked in and they greeted us right away. Got a table right by the grill. Interesting place. They have a bar area and a grill area but nothing about the place stood out to me. 

So I found out that they have little tags at the table that you bring to the grill. So you basically give them you name and your bowl size then get your bowl and fill it with meat and veggies. Fill it as high as possible. So many possibilities. They give you a small cup for your sauce that you pick out too. Then it's off to the grill and since I got a medium bowl you get two choices of your carbs. Noodles, rice, and even tortillas. I just basically got brown rice. Anyways, when it's done they bring your bowl to your table. 

So the bowl was pretty good. Fresh veggies and fresh meat. It's a pretty good concept. Enjoyed the food and the relaxing environment. Wouldn't mine going back. Enjoy.

168 I came here and ordered a small bowl for $12.49 and my husband a medium bowl for $14.49. The bowl I reviewed was so tiny! That tiny little thing for $12.49? Jeez. I made my bowl and everything was good. They got my husband's bowl wrong though. He requested pasta and had rice. 

Overall the service was good. My bowl was good, my husbands bowl didn't taste that great. But I wasn't satisfied because the bowl was so small! I'm a tiny girl, and I wasn't even half full from this meal. I've had build your own bowls before and you can go to Mongolian grill for cheaper price and 3x bigger bowl to fill up.

170 Shopping can be exasperating. And community shopping where a bunch of friends get together and shop as a group can be even more exhausting.

Since my wife had never eaten here in the past, we decided to give it a try to see how she would like the fare. Usually, my wife doesn't like Mongolian Barbecue restaurants, but she decided to suspend judgment. 

We liked that there was quite a variety of meats, vegetables, and toppings that you could use. One quibble that we both had is that it is extremely difficult to reach the sauces in the back row. However both of our meals were quite delicious and cooked to perfection.  

At the end, we had the amazing brownie and ice cream with hot fudge I have pictured. It was truly delicious. The brownie was thick and decadent, and the vanilla ice cream was quite creamy and flavorful. 

We'll be back again. My wife is now a true convert.

175 I went into this restaurant for the first time today, thinking it was your standard Asian cuisine type of establishment. I wasn't expecting to have to come up with my own ingredient choices for my stir-fry, and was a little intimidated at first, but I think they make it hard for you to go wrong. My stir-fry came out better than I thought it would, it was delicious, and pretty cool since I chose the ingredients myself. Although I had a great time just by myself, I could see this restaurant as great for a date or fun with friends and family. Would recommend.

176 Visited this restaurant a few weekends ago. The server asked if it was our first time, which it was. She was friendly and brought us our beverages quickly. We were confused after we went through the line, added our sauces, and handed our food over to be cooked. We didn't know if were were supposed to wait there or if it would be brought out to us. It was brought out to us as we walked back up unsure. The food was ok, but seemed pricey for how little we got. Also, yes I did pile my bowl high.

179 I hadn't been to a Genghis in 6+ years & never to this location but it had changed things up from what I remember for sure. Not knowing how spicy their spicy was I went balls out. Boy howdy if I were a cartoon I would have had steam coming from my ears for sure. But luckily I'm not a cartoon so nobody knew how insanely hot I had gone on my bowl. Because of my master skills at Mongolian BBQ flavors I couldn't stop eating it & made it through a giant dinner bowl. 
I will be back & keep my spicy hand on a leash so I can really, really enjoy.

181 Mongolian dinner? Why not?! 
This little restaurant is hidden within Tempe Market Place treasures. The inside is a lot bigger than expected. 
After the waiter seated us, he explained what we were suppose to do and left to get our drinks. 
Each costumer goes to the counter where there are 3 size of bowls to choose from and tons of ingredients for the desired meal. Once all items are in the bowl, the cook takes care of the rest and the food is served at the table shortly after. For whatever reason, I always forget that my eyes are bigger than my stomach so I get too much food. This was the case at Genghis as well, however I enjoyed my food choice.

183 I've been here a couple of times and have always enjoyed the variety. I get the rice noodles with chicken, shallots, carrots, onions, bean sprouts, and peas. The first time that I came, there was a clear flow thanks to the little card that they give you which made it easy to put all of my food together and have it cooked. They also serve it to you when it's finished which is better than having to wait by the chefs' area.

184 Maybe I went in expecting too much based on the other reviews.  I thought it was good, but not great.  The owner is like your Korean aunty.  She jokes about how she's the only person there and how the service is so bad.  But it's not bad, just slow because she does it all herself.  I understood this going in.

The vegetable fried rice was just ok.  Could've had a bit more flavor.  Kim chee was also just ok.  The kalbi was pretty good though.  I'm used to having the bone still on there, but they were nice thick pieces with good BBQ flavor.  Very good.  The bulgogi was also pretty good, but could've had just a little more flavoring.

I agree with one of the other reviewers here.  Dasonii out in Robinson Township is better, and a bit closer to my house too.  But if you're in the area, it's not a bad place to eat.  Just be prepared to wait a while.

185 This is the kind of place that you don't want others to find out about. It's small, very small and the food is amazing. The owner is the sweetest woman who will cook you some of the spiciest and most delicious Korean food around. The pancake with hot peppers is spicy but not unbearable. The buldak chicken is definitely spicy. The kim chi is on point! I cannot wait to go back and try more items from the menu but like I said, this place gets very busy with only the owner cooking!

186 Was visiting my BF in Smithton and wasn't feeling well, so I wanted to get some kimchijigae and turned to Yelp for suggestions. So happy to have found this place. One of the newspaper articles in the restaurant describes the owner as a one woman show and that is absolutely true. Especially with the intimate setup, it's like walking into a Korean mom's kitchen. We were there at 2pm on a Saturday and the place was full (only seats about 10) and service was really slow, because like I said, it's a one woman show. She was doing everything from taking orders & payment, food prep, cooking, and waiting. However, the food made the wait absolutely worth it. It took about 40 minutes to be served, but the mackerel kimchi stew, fried mandu (dumplings) and kimchi & pork fried rice were all so delicious. There was a generous portion of mackerel in the stew, the mandu was perfectly crispy, and the fried rice was really yummy and a huge portion. It's honestly better than the Korean food I've had in KTown LA, KTown NYC and Annandale, VA. I was so surprised with it being the middle of nowhere PA. Ms. Kwon repeatedly thanked us for our patience and checked in on us multiple times. Even though the food was really slow to come out, I would still absolutely recommend this hole in the wall.

187 My favorite restaurant anywhere in the world. Yong is a perfectionist and her food will blow you away. It seats 12 and is worth any wait. I crave the kimchi gigai and her spicy pancake is tasty!
Beef galbi is the kids favorite!

189 A friend recommended this place. We came here and ordered a few classic and popular Korean items but all are mediocre. Kind of disappointed. Especially considering the location and price.

190 We are regulars. My husband and I have been going there about once a month for the last 4 years. Tried everything on the menu. Kimchi pancake is a must because it's better than any other Korean restaurant in the Pittsburgh area-- crispy, chewy and not too thick so you'll have space for other goodies on the menu. My husband used to hate tofu but her tofu dish transformed him. Now he orders it almost every time he goes there. Kalbi (beef short ribs) is very rich tasting and cooked to perfection (medium rare if you don't specify). Menu is small but everything is worth a try. The restaurant is smaller than many people's living room and it's an experience just to watch. Go if you haven't already.

191 First time there. Food was good/fresh. The mom was nice. The daughter was miserable. I asked her for two waters and a iced tea-- she pointed at the cooler and left our table. The drinks are help yourself I guess. No personality. Very rude. Anyway first time eating Korean. It was good. I prob would go back. The dumplings were great.

195 I went here a few months back and meant to post a review because this place really deserves one. Really good food cooked home style. The place is probably the smallest restaurant I've ever been to - seats about 10 people total. It feels like your long-lost Korean mom is making you dinner in her kitchen. The ambience is darling, the cook is fabulous and totally endearing, and the food is really good. I wouldn't say it was the best bulgogi I've ever had, but it was very tasty. The mandu was really delicious, and I highly recommend them. Take a drive out to Cecil PA just to try this place. Can't wait to go back!!

198 WOW I have lived down the road from this place since well before it ever existed and today was the first day I have ever been there.  Everything there was amazing the service the food and the fact that it was BYOB.  I had the veg. pancake, ramen soup, and a pork dish that I can not remeber the name of that the owner recommended to me and there is no way it could have been better.

199 The good reviews here are spot on. The pickle, spicy slaw, and kimchi tasted fresh and homemade and paired with the kimchi pancake so every bite was different. The mandu (dumplings) had a beef filling that had so much flavor - possibly fresh lemongrass? The bean thread noodles (jap chai) and bulgogi plates were almost licked clean. There was so much flavor we never even touched the red pepper sauce and soy sauce on the table. Agreeing with other reviews, very small, one owner cooking and serving fresh food so the food may take a couple minutes if it is busy. The servings seemed just right to me. Takeout may be the way to go. I can't wait until we are back in the area. I would also like to try the ramen or another soup and the super spicy chicken but might have to also have the jap chae a few more times.

202 So I've lived in Cecil most of my life and finally stopped here to eat.  Wow - what a pleasant surprise!  

I started off with the spicy ramen and once my wife got a taste of it we ended up splitting it.  It had a nice kick but still had a bunch of complex flavors going on - the heat doesn't overpower you.

For my meal I mistakenly ordered just the pork fried rice.  I misunderstood the menu - it normally comes with beef, chicken, and pork but I thought I had to choose.  No matter...it was still excellent.  My wife got the Dak Bo Kum which is essentially chicken with veggies and a side of rice.  It also had a very unique flavor to it that we both loved.  

What really made the trip enjoyable were the owners.  They were both so kind and you could tell the genuinely cared about how our food tasted - not something you get to experience very often.  

We will definitely be going back here a bunch!!!

204 Finding good Korean food in Southwestern PA is not a simple task, but rest assured that Cecil, PA is home to a true gem.  Housed in a small location, the restaurant does offer an intimate setting for those lucky enough to find a seat.  Showing up early to ensure a seat is certainly recommended. For those who prefer the take-out option, Golden Pig certainly doesn't disappoint.  My personal favorite items on the menu are the Daeji Bulgogi and the Buldak-Chicken dishes.  A unique item on the menu that comes highly recommended would also be the Korean Pancake with Kimchi.  For those new to Korean food, please bare in mind there is a slight spice that accompanies most selections.  The Kimchi Fried Rice is certainly an option for those shying away from the spicier options. 

A great location with delicious food and a very friendly proprietor.

212 I can see why this place gets really good reviews--it's almost like going to a Korean house and having a nice, home cooked meal. The food is good; many of your standard Korean items are on the menu and the prices are reasonable. I got the impression that many of the folks who come here come here very frequently. Seating is very limited--I counted eleven chairs on the inside and a few on the outside for those brief months in Pittsburgh when this is a feasible eating arrangement. The bulgogi I had was solid.

214 First time I went here, my food was to spicy and hot to eat.  Second time it was better, they have good kimchi.  It is definitely different, but I haven't come across something that has made me want to come back to it.  The place is sooooo tiny, it is a little awkward.  I had the beef but it was little to sweet for my taste, wasn't crazy over it.  So far, I have only liked the kimchi.  The guy cuts the cabbage outside on a table.  It is definitely authentic.  But I have had better.

222 I was in Canonsburg for a church meeting today.  I drove through Cecil and remembered hearing about an amazing Korean restaurant in this town.  On the way home from my meeting, I thought why not stop by The Golden Pig for lunch?  I am so glad I stopped by!

This 10 seat restaurant is presided by the most colorful Korean lady.  I didn't catch her name but wow, was she entertaining!

I got there at 1pm and it was still pretty packed.  And as I was finishing up, there was another couple and a family of 5 trying to get in for a late lunch.

I wanted to order just about everything on the menu.  It's a short menu, but all my Korean favorites.  I finally settled on the Daiji Bulgogi ($7.50) - Thin-sliced marinated pork in a spicy red pepper glaze.  Absolutely delicious and it came with a great assortment of banchan (Korean side dishes - seaweed and chives and kimchi).  The Daiji Bulgogi was just perfectly spicy.  The last time I had this was in Seoul last summer and it totally brought me back there in my first bite.

My bill came to $9.00 pre-tip and I ordered a Diet Coke.  I will have to make the trip to Cecil more often when I get my Korean food craving - which seems to be more often than not these days!  

Why not take the trip off the beaten path and give this place a shot?  I would never have guessed finding exceptional Korean food in a sleepy little town like Cecil.  It was like being back in Seoul - an incredible feat for a one woman show serving the dining room and cooking up classic soul satisfying Korean food at the same time!

223 It took me way too long to discover this little gem of a restaurant, but now that I have, I'll be going back regularly. Doug found it, actually, while looking through Yelp reviews, so we both owe a big thanks to the other Yelpers out there for your guidance.

The first thing I noticed about this place was how clean it is...absolutely spotless, which warms the heart of an ex-restaurant worker such as myself. There are two tables which both seat 3, and four seats along the bar. It was quiet when we arrived, and that was nice, as it gave us an opportunity to chat with the woman who was waiting tables and helping out in the kitchen. She was helpful and friendly, as was Yong Kwon, the owner, who works wonders in that tiny kitchen of hers. We started with the Korean pancake, which we ordered with potato...she asked if we wanted more veggies, and we said yes. This pancake was delicious...crispy and a little brown on the outside and creamy within, with plenty of vegetables inside. This pancake comes with the cole slaw and pickles, kim chee and sweet potatoes that had been marinated in soy, garlic and maple syrup then roasted in the oven. Everything was perfect; I especially appreciate that the sides came to the table room temperature and not straight from the fridge. Things taste so much better when they're the right temp, and the chef knows this. We went for the Daiji Bulgogi, marinated sliced pork that's served in a rich chile sauce that's slightly sweetened and garlicky, and the Buldak, a chicken dish that featured chicken thigh pieces in a very spicy chile sauce. Both dishes were spicy, with the pork dish having a greater variety of flavorings in it that balanced nicely between sweet, spicy and garlicky. The chicken dish was more a one note sauce, and tasted pretty much of straight chiles. I've had sauces like this in Mexico...dried red chiles pureed and mixed with very little else... and I love them. Both dishes were superb. I'll warn you here...you had better like spicy food if you're going to eat here. I understand some dishes here pack less heat than others, and I'm sure I'll discover which ones as I make my way through this menu. Yong runs the kitchen alone, so call ahead if you're in a hurry. My future plans are to go when it's slow and have a leisurely time of it, as we did last night. Yong is very friendly and obviously enjoys her customers, so you really do feel like you're in her home. Lovely place, lovely woman, and great food.

224 You wouldn't think to find authentic Korean food in Cecil, but it exists at the Golden Pig! As many others have mentioned, the space is so incredibly tiny and truthfully, it feels like you're in someone's kitchen and not very much like a restaurant. Knowing this, we ordered takeout and that was the way to go since we had a large group. There was no way the restaurant could have accommodated our group of six. 

The food was quite delicious. My husband and I ordered the Korean pancake with kim chi, spicy pork bulgogi, and the japchae. All amazing. Quite honestly, you could taste the love and care put into the food. The best way for me to describe this feeling is how you warm you feel when you're at home with your family, eating your favorite dish your mother made when you were a child. Am I making sense? Doesn't matter. The food at Golden Pig is legit. 

If you're searching for delicious Korean food, come to Golden Pig. If you love some spicy food, come to Golden Pig. If you're looking for something new to try, come to the Golden Pig. Heck, you don't really need any other reasons. Just go already...

231 While the Pittsburgh area isn't always known for it's great selection of ethnic cuisine, the Golden Pig is one of PIttsburgh's best kept secrets if Korean food is of your liking.  The owner, Yong Kwon, came to the states to be closer to her grandchild; she runs this place pretty much by herself. Whenever you go, it's like sitting in her own personal kitchen. the place is small, but very cozy. Has room for about ten. This is my favorite Korean restaurant and I personally think its better than the restaurants I've been to in Korea. If you need suggestions, you can never go wrong with the kimchi pancake, the bulgogi and the mandu (Korean dumplings).

233 This restaurant is definitely a hole in the wall type of place, more like a house built in the middle of nowhere. The owner single-handily full-fills all the positions in the restaurant. I gotta admit, the service can be slow, but pretty darn good when all 4 positions are held by the same person. She's the hostess, waitress, chef, and owner. She puts on the show right in front of you, and often throws a joke here and there for entertainment. This is the most authentic Korean restaurant in Pittsburgh, thank goodness I found this place, or my Korean food cravings would never be put to rest. The food is fresh and extremely flavorful. I highly recommend the kimchi or vegeatable pancake, add some of their hot sauce, and you have heaven in your mouth.  Their Jap Chae is perfectly made, very flavorful. I love food with a lot of flavor, on the salty side, so if you like the lightly flavored foods, you may need to ask the chef to tone down on the salt/soysauce. 

Portions are good, price is fairly cheap for Korean food in Pittsburgh.

Warning: Place is tiny. There're only 3 small tables and a mini bar inside so come early (before 6:30pm) if you want seats. There's a table outside that's good for 5 or 6. But let's face it, with Pittsburgh weather, you really can only dine at the table during summer. It's too cold to eat outside in the winter, fall, and even spring. This place is not good for parties of 4 or more. I recommend you order to go.

234 As authentic as you can get.  Sauce is not too sweet and is light.  Prices are very reasonable for a home cooked meal.  The bulgogi has fine slivers of beef in a light sauce reduction.  The beef is not smothered with sauce but rather complemented and the vegetables are cooked crunchy.  Portions are just right.

235 Love. The proprietor over heard my conversation once (in the tiny space) about my love of octopus and squid. She was kind enough to give me the tentacles , which is my favorite and not commonly served. This was a long while ago, but it still sticks with me. That is caring, folks. Why on earth would you have someone cook you a meal who didn't care and pour themselves into a dish? 
Home cooked food, but a sweet grandmother.
Every single person that  I have met there, has been wonderful. Whether you're in a chatty mood or not, the tiny space makes strangers your neighbors. It's wonderful. A true delight.

239 The Golden Pig is one of my favorite places around, and is well worth the drive from the city, as long as you're prepared ton possibly have to take it to-go as they have very limited seating. I work nearby and eat here very often. The Buldak chicken is my favorite item on the menu. For lunch, you get a decent portion with kimchi coleslaw and white rice on the side that's very filling, especially considering it's eight bucks. The dinner portion is huge, and only three dollars more. The Jap Chae is another favorite, with a lot of flavor packed into the glass noodles and a good amount of vegetables mixed in. I also recommend their kimbap (like sushi). The owners are there every day and are very friendly. It's easy to get into a habit of eating here - I can't get tired of it!

240 I guess I came here with high expectations or came on an off day. We ordered the man du and daiji bulgogi. All were just ok, I can make better daiji bulgogi at home. Flavor-wise, Dasonii by the airport is much better with similar prices.

I would give this place only a 3 if it wasn't for the awesome experience though. Tiny restaurant, limited seating, grandmas-kitchen-feel. Like everyone says, the owner takes our order, cooks it fresh, and serves it herself.

Pro-tip: there is outdoor seating (picnic tables) in the back. Place your order inside and let the owner know your eating outside.

243 I've had take out from here a few times and always found the food acceptable. This time, for the first time, I ordered the bolgogi! It was exceptional and probably the only thing I will order from there in the future. It was that good! The only criticism I could give is that they don't really give you enough rice. You get a portion with your meal which comes in one container. I'm used to getting a separate carton of rice when getting Asian takeout.

244 This rating does not reflect a comparison between other cities' Korean food as this would not be an apples-to-apples comparison.  If you spent as much time as I did seeking out decent, non-Americanized Asian cuisine, you would understand. It would simply be unfair to judge a one-woman's home cooking operation to other large businesses in established Asian communities.  Simply put, she does a decent job in putting out a homey feel with food at reasonable prices.

Their condensed version of ban chan (small side items that accompanies the entree) come combined on one plate.  The handmade kimchi was outstanding and she also packages them in jars for sale.   

Some of the items on the menu I had:

Korean pancake - the texture is consistent with what I expect and the optional hot peppers really add a delayed heat kick that I enjoyed.

Bulgogi- a stir fry of seasoned meat and veggies that comes with steamed rice.  Simple but hits the spot.

Short Rib - comes already deboned and tender.  The marinade on the soft, tender meat is a welcome change.  I would have liked it even more with grilled onions.  

Mackerel tofu soup - large chunks of fish and spicy tofu soup.  The spines of the fish were super soft and can be eaten so no bones to worry about.  

Verdict: best Korean outside the city on the south side of town.

245 It's like sitting in someone's kitchen -- and it's only about the size of one too. It's only the second time I've ever had Korean food and the first time I had to go to LA to get it. So my quick trip down the road to Cecil was not a disappointment. 

First: the food. I got Mandu which is classic Korean dumplings served with rice. Mine had broccoli, carrot, cabbage & tofu in them. There were way too many to ever eat in one sitting. Especially because we started with Kimchi Pancakes and a little kimchi veggie salad. 

Next: the environment. Golden Pig gets a lot of regulars. People kept coming into the store and going behind the counter to grab something to snack on or talk to the owner. Just as I was leaving a big rowdy group of guys came in and basically filled the restaurant. They started to pass around wine to all of us in the restaurant. 

It was an experience unlike any other, for sure.

This place is very tiny so definitely take-out. I decided to try the Korean pancakes-mixed veggies, mandu (Korean dumplings) and jap chae(?). Food is excellent. I will definitely be back to try some more food.

251 By far the best Korean food in the city. After living in Korea for years, I missed the food. I've tried other places but generally have been disappointed. 

The Golden Pig is my go to place. Although it's small and often need to wait, it's worth it. 

Her kimchi is amazing! I always start with a side of kimchi and a pancake (usually kimichi). My two favorite dishes here are the doenjang-jjigae (tofu soup) and the daeji bulgogi (spicy pork). 

It's a little out of the way but that shouldn't stop you from trying this cute little BYOB spot. It's also cool to see the community really support this place.

252 While they do not need any more positive reviews, I will add this one to the mix to attempt to convince any of you on the fence to enjoy this treasure in Western PA.   

First, come with a sense of adventure and love for everything fresh, homemade and absolutely stunning.  To some, Korean seems like something from another planet but it is simple, flavorful and often spice.  On this trip, my partner in crime and I shared a kimchi pancake, the beef bulgogi and a tofu and vegetables dish.  

I will start with her kimchi.. house made and simple.  Absolutely stunning as is the entire pickle plate served with every meal.  Pickled cucumbers, daikon radishes, Korean slaw and kimchi.  The bulgogi is amazing if not different than what you might have had elsewhere.  The pancakes are stunning, the absolute best of any I have every experienced here in the States.   She pan fries hers to crispy, making them even more yummy.   It's tiny, six seats are the counter and three tables.  Most of her business is take out so I suggest planning a trip soon.

253 Very enjoyable meal with the family.  The Korean mixed vegetable pancake (spicy) was very tasty with chunks of jalape챰o peppers. Korean coleslaw with chile peppers was cool and spicy at the same time.  Ramen was very tasty.  Chicken flavor with lots of egg bits and noodles.  My daughter ordered spicy noodles, which while spicy were too sweet for my taste.  Story fry chicken with vegetables was extremely fresh.  Spicy pork was wonderful with distinct Korean flavors.  Next time I want to try the spicy squid.

254 This is such a cute place! I went there last night with my BFF, and brought a bottle of wine as it is BYOB. It is a cute quaint place. I read that it was small, but I didn't realize how small! It was a very intimate environment. We got there at the perfect time and got a seat right away, however 2 couples came in shortly after us had to wait until we were done...it was a beautiful day so I don't think they minded. We split the Korean Pancake and Mandu for appetizers and the Bulgogi and the Vegetable Jop-Chae as entrees. Everything was flavored perfectly. This is true authentic Korean cuisine! I will definitely go back!

257 Freaking awesome Korean place in the middle of nowhere. The Golden Pig is so great that we travel over an hour to get there just to sit outside as they only have two, yes that's right two tables. It is imperative that one get there before 7 as they often shut down early. Just get there early and be prepared to eat outside or get takeout.

258 I made the trek here from Shadyside to quell a hankering for some real Korean food and was a little disappointed. (I suppose I have been spoiled with LA's K-town and its delicious little holes-in-the-wall on every block.) The bulgogi was so-so and my friend's ramen came out of a package--then again, why someone would order ramen at a Korean restaurant? Great mandu, though. 

But I have to admit, the tiny place is almost too cute. Come at a dead hour, say 3pm, sit at the bar and chat with Young as she puts together your lunch. It may not be the best lunch you've ever had, nor the cheapest, but you'll feel like it was made with love. And that's more than enough.

259 So you know those places that you'd never just come across?  And even if you did, you probably wouldn't go inside if someone didn't tell you to?  That's this place and it's a total find.  It's tiny -- and I mean tiny.  3 little tables and maybe 5 seats at the bar.  That's it.  The whole place can't be more than a few hundred square feet.  They cook everything to order and warn you when you come in that it might be a while before you eat.   It's well worth the wait.   

We started with the little complimentary sampling dish - not even sure what it was, but I liked it.   We then got a the kimchi pancake and the mandu - both were delicious and flavorful.  An order of the beef bulgogi and a sample of the gim bap that my boyfriend ordered topped off the meal.   Everything was simply delightful and seemed very authentic.   It went well with the bottle of wine I brought in with me.  You can see them cooking it all order and they talk to the guests while they do it.   

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this place and would absolutely trek out to Cecil to try it again.

261 This place is tiny but the food is good if you are craving Korean and don't want to drive far. There's not a lot of room to sit inside, but on a nice day it would be great to sit outside. The pancake is a must! Don't be expecting the little dishes that you usually get at Korean restaurants. The bulgogi is a little more runny than I would like but then again, it's close by so it'll suffice.

264 I feel like this food is more genuine (less Americanized) and truly what one would find coming out of someone's home kitchen maybe in Seoul or another region. While I can't claim to have experienced Korea, I've worked in Los Angeles for years and frequented restaurants in Koreatown many, many times. The quality, taste and care going into the food is wonderful and I've never had a bad meal. 

They also have some great vegetarian and vegan options for those customers as well. 

Only complaint I have is how many people come from downtown to eat at my little spot 15 miles outside the city!!! :)

To address a couple of the lower ratings below... Maybe go find a Korean Applebees or get yourself some Giant Eagle sushi and you'll be happy. It also takes real courage to stand your ground for water ;) 

For the average American diner, this is going to be a new flavor palate for you, so be ready! This isn't a Korean PF Changs.

266 You get genuine Korean cuisine here. My Mom is Korean and I will bring her here sometimes to eat because she enjoys the food. The hot squid is her favorite. My kids like the beef bulgogi and chop jae. The mandoo is very good also. They do a good takeout business, because the indoor sitting area is small. Very good service and kind owner.

268 Stopped in for lunch and was very satisfied with the meal. Ordered egg drop soup and bulgogi  which came with steamed rice. Soup was full of veggies and eggs with enough broth to still be a soup some spice but nothing hard to swallow. Kimchi salad was excellent and traditional as far as I know. Bulgogi was tender and marinated well stir fried with stalks and onions. Topped with sesame seeds and couldn't be any better. All for $13! If you are near the area stop by for authentic Korean food. 

Only issue was the owner was the only person there working so during lunchtime it was difficult to get in and out, but I suppose that's the price you pay for homemade Asian cuisine!

274 This is what dining is meant to be. A comfortable home style atmosphere, with food that is beyond exceptional. She's truly an artisan, and employs skills that have been passed down from her mother. I would trade every chain in the city of Pittsburgh, for 2-3 more restaurants with the pneuma that exists here. Unfortunately, It would be nearly impossible to recreate that magic, especially in a world of Edison light bulbs and overrated food.

275 This is one of the most authentic experiences I've had when dining out.  It is basically walking into a version of Yong Kwon's kitchen.  The food is prepared especially for you, as she accommodates each level of spice to your liking and will modify the meal to your preference.  The food is extremely fresh.  This restaurant has never disappointed me.  If you want to try out an amazing, tasty Korean dishes, this hole in the wall is an absolute must!!

276 It's really a one-woman show. She is such a sweetie and doesn't take a moment to pause in the kitchen, working away trying to serve everyone as fast as possible while still being friendly to all her guests an apologizing for the wait. Everything is fresh to order. EVERYTHING. I saw her get fresh veggies out of her fridge and chop them fresh for order. The only thing in a box were presoftened chapchae noodles. Imagine your mom making dinner for your family five times in a row in an hour. She is really working miracles there.

That said, the wait got pretty long while we were there, and that's with some of her regulars helping her after they finished eating. Really gives you that mom's kitchen feel. Made me smile.

Judging on the food itself alone, I don't think she's necessarily much better Asian-mom cook than many ordinary moms out there. In that respect it's not very impressive. In comparison, I have had better Mom&Pop shop Korean food in a similar type restaurant (though unfortunately located far away in Houston).

We had mandoo, daeji bulgolgi, chapchae noodles, korean pancakes. Everything tasted good and well-cooked but very ordinarily homey, and while I appreciate this and think it's the definite selling point of this adorable little shop, my parents were not impressed by the flavor and mom thought it's nothing she can't make herself... and she's probably right. 

Personally, I don't feel the need to come back as long as my mom is willing to feed me. But I recommend this as an awesome Asian-mom substitute for those in need of some delicious home-made comfort food. Everything about Golden Pig is just a home-with-your-mom experience. If I had something like this near me, I'd definitely be the top regular. But I know there are students in the 'Burgh away from their moms who would loooove a place like this to get a taste of home - too bad it's located so far away from the city :(

277 After leaving Korea I began to crave the food.  This place is as authentic as it gets without being in Korea.  No Soju, but bring your own.  

Classic Kimchi and other Kimchi's are all top notch, as is everything else.  Try Kimchi Chigae..  

Go if you haven't, you are really missing out.

278 What a hidden gem.  At the end of Route 50, past the Original Farmer's Market the road narrows from 4 lanes to 2, a quarter of a mile on the left is the Golden Pig.  The building is easy to pass as it is shared with a barber and an equipment dealer. There is a small parking lot next to the building and one table for outside dining.  The Golden Pig reminds me of visiting a friend's family room.  Three high top tables and a bar are the only seating.  Each meal is individually prepared by the owner and absolutely delicious.  We enjoyed the pepper pancakes which are not at all like a breakfast pancake. Thin crisp cakes are served with a spicy red sauce that enhances the flavors.  Spicy noodle soup has an abundance of home made ramen noodles, filling and flavorful.  My husband enjoyed the beef bulgogi. This is a BYOB and many people stopped in for take out. Really excellent Korean food in an unlikely place of Cecil.

279 Brought the parents here for dinner since mom loves Korean food. This restaurant is incredibly charming - only a few tables & bar seating inside, with cute pig toys & trinkets decorating every wall & corner of the interior. The service is very friendly - only a man & a woman working when we walked in, but they quickly prepared a table for us and made us feel at home. 

Between our group, we split: Mixed Vegetable Pancake, Beef Bulgogi, Japchae, and Beef Fried Rice. They also served us some small dishes of pickled radishes, kimchi, woodear, and marinated cabbage. The pancake was a great - crispy with lots of veggies. The beef in the fried rice & bulgogi had amazing flavor and the japchae was also super tasty and looked beautiful. 

They also had a giant pineapple cake that appeared to have been just baked and were offering it to all of the customers. Although we were pretty stuffed, we made room for the cake :D It's not the quickest place to sit down and have a meal, since they only have 1 server & 1 cook, but everything is well worth the wait. If you're in a hurry, I believe they also do takeout though!

284 Had an amazing time at this place. The owner/chef is a very sweet hardworking lady who will feel like your mom when she's cooking in the kitchen in front of you. 

The food was authentic and fantastic. There are only 11 seats total in this place so get there early! 

They have a regular soda selection along with 4 to 5 imported non alcoholic drinks (sweet rice, plum, & ginseng are some of the flavors I can recall)

Had the bugolgi, kimchi pancake & mandu. All were fantastic! 

I selfishly don't want this place to move or get bigger so it always feels so exclusive and special.

285 I knew Golden Pig was a small one woman operation and her leanings were home cooked Korean. I couldn't wait to try her food. The owner was very warm & welcoming and we were seated at one of 2 tables in the restaurant. There were also 2 other patrons seated at the bar that had 4 stools. It's a tiny operation. We ordered the Korean Pancake with Kimchi to start. My husband ordered the bul dak chicken that was described as fiery hot. I ordered the pork daeji bulgogi. 

Our Korean Pancake arrived with 2 starter plates with some amazing Korean Coleslaw, Kimchi & other assorted veggies. I mixed all the starter goodies with my kimchi pancake & it worked. Without these enhancements the pancake wasn't nearly as exciting. 

Both of our main dishes arrived with what appeared to be a similar sauce - the color of hot cheetos (that's literally off the Post Gazette review that hung above our table & he nailed it!). The sauces were nearly identical & I actually preferred it over my husband's chicken than my pork. Spice on a  1-10 scale was probably a 7 for the chicken & a 5 on the pork. That was about the only difference in the sauces that I could discern. It was definitely a home cooked style & pretty good.

If I lived close enough to frequent Golden Pig, I believe the owner's charming personality could woo me into a 4 star. She's quite fun and really brings her personality into her cooking. Realistically it's a 3.5 rating. Although I 100% get the plethora of 5 star ratings she's getting from regulars who adore her. 

We are in love with Korean food & have tried some truly stellar places, sadly not in Pittsburgh. Not yet anyway.

288 I recently experienced one of the most amazing meals of my life at Golden Pig. A friend took us there for lunch and it was outstanding. It is a tiny restaurant run by Mrs. Kwon. When I say tiny, I mean tiny. The place only has two tables and a small bar. Mrs. Kwon cooks everything herself onsite, as you order. 

We ordered the korean veggie pancake and the fried sweet potatoes for our appetizers. Besides being delicious, it was full of fresh cut veggies. Along with the appetizers we also got a dish with pickled radishes and cucumbers. The radishes were a bit spicy for me but I have a delicate palette. :)

Between the four of us we ordered bulgogi, ramen and man du. I had the man du and it was incredible. If you haven't tried it yet. do it now.

289 There has been so much written about this place I'm not sure what to add. The food is wonderful and the owner makes you feel like you're part of her family. The downside is that there are only about 8 seats in the entire restaurant. Not 8 tables, 8 seats. Still, it's well worth the effort. The experience is so much more than the food, which I can't say enough good things about. Weeknights might improve your odds of getting a table.

290 The food at Golden Pig is amazing! Flavorful, spicy, and not your everyday Pittsburgh fare. My husband and I have eaten in a few times, as well as done take out.

291 I have to give credit to the Yelpers who have gone before me on this one.  Everything was exactly as described:
- Odd, hole-in-the-wall location? check
- Tiny eating space? check
- One woman as chef/hostess/server/busperson? check
- Long wait? check (nearly an hour)
- Incredibly fresh, tasty and authentic food? check

I ordered the Korean pancake with mixed vegetables and hot green pepper, which was delectable in addition to clearing my sinuses.  I also tried the Jop-Chae, which is a sweet potato noodle dish with vegetables.  This was also fantastic.  It was a subtle mix of flavors, including sesame seeds and sesame oil.

The food is definitely worth the wait.  I arrived at 7pm and was advised it would be 45 minutes before she could make my order.  I finally got it about an hour after my order, but a small price to pay for the good eats.  Fortunately, I had a decent amount of spare time and sat outside watching a softball game being played on the field behind the restaurant.  Highly recommended if you plan ahead.

293 So I didn't know what to expect from this place. It's in the middle of the suburbs and was touted as having the best Korean food. Umm, ok.

I walked in and it's TINY. Just a handful of seats,  so definitely not the place to bring a group of friends or family. But it's charming and the owner is such a warm and welcoming hostess. I glanced at the short menu, then made a few selections. I decided to have the spicy ramen there and ordered the bulgogi and tofu saut챕ed with kimchi and pork to go.

The ramen was ready quickly and is served with lots of tasty vegetables to add in. It was freaking delicious. The noodles were al dente and the broth couldn't have been more flavorful. The portion was definitely enough to be a meal...I actually took some home with me.

Once I got into my car, the smell of the other dishes completely overwhelmed my senses and I had to give it a try. Good grief this woman can cook!  You can tell that she really cares about every single dish she creates and puts her soul into the food. 

I live in Regent Square and I have come to the conclusion that I will have to make regular trips out to Cecil to enjoy more of Ms. Kwon's fabulous food.

294 Walking into this place, you definitely wouldn't think it would produce amazing food but I was wrong. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the atmosphere inside of the shop. It's definitely more of a take-out place, and I wasn't exactly greeted in the most friendly way. The service got better and better the longer we were there. I got the Kalbi, which was awesome and flavorful. I would love to get it again, but I feel I should try bulgogi as I've heard it's a favorite of nant. My wife is a vegetarian and they had many options for her to try.

300 I frequent a Korean joint that I absolutely LOVE near home, so when other patrons there mentioned the Golden Pig I had to make a point to stop in.  
Of course I'm comparing the 2 directly and this place was good but not nearly as good as Chongs. I ordered the exact same meal that I normally would: Bulgogi (marinated beef), veggie pancake & Bimbap (seaweed roll). 
The layers of flavors are good and if you've never had Korean food you really should change that.  The thing I missed here were the dipping sauces and different textures between fresh and cooked veggies served along with the Bulgogi that I'm used to. 
They clearly use the same seasonings but different cooking methods, the bulgogi seemed soft & soupy, as if it's prepared in a slow cooker. Flavor was good, just a really tender texture that I didn't expect. 
Golden Pig is a bit pricey in comparison at $54 for lunch where I'd normally pay $28 for the same order at my local joint.  I don't think I'll return, however you should at least try it. 
There are 2 tables and maybe 4 stools at the counter so be prepared to wait on a table or just order to go. One little Korean lady running the whole show,  so clean your own table, get your own drinks & silverware. Make yourself right at home.

303 Great one woman operation.  It's like you've been invited over to her house and she's making you her mom's Korean dishes.  It can be busy and the wait can be really long but she tries really hard and the food is really delicious.  I wish she would get a bigger place and a little help so I wouldn't feel the pressure of her having to juggle phone orders, table service and cooking.  Sometimes she looks a little harried.

I love her pancakes a lot.  The pork bulgogi is really fabulous.  The kimchi was a little salty last night and she could serve more dishes but all in all we are lucky to have her here to make us authentic Korean food.  We've eaten there a few times now and always leave happy.

304 We recently discovered this place due to traveling for soccer.   It is now on my top 5 places to eat locally - really, everything on the menu is fresh, tasty and soooo good!   My favorites are the Kimchi and spicy pepper pancakes; bulgogi (ask for spicy!) and the mandu.    I've been here 4 or 5 times now and I never get tired of it.  The owner is a sweet Korean woman who is very nice and will do her best to make your experience wonderful.    The review from 12.14.15 (Alistair C.) is really over the top rude and ignorant;  he sounds like a whiny snot from the west coast that isn't happy with ANYTHING from Pittsburgh (left several other nasty local reviews) so maybe he can take his uppity self back to Seattle.    We LOVE Golden Pig and Mrs. Kwon - and more and more local people are discovering her delicious food.

306 Family members have been here and I've driven by it many times, yet tonight was the first time I dined here. Two of us split the potato Korean pancake. Yum. I had the Bulgogi which was incredibly tender marinated beef and my friend had Man-Du. We both departed with leftovers. 
We will be back. And yes, it is tiny. A party of six came in and left when they saw the place was half full. I don't think I would go there with more than two other friends.

307 Such a wonderful little restaurant. The place has less than 15 seats inside and a couple outdoor tables. We started with the Mandu dumplings w spicy coleslaw and a spicy dipping sauce and a Korean pancake with hot peppers.

I've had the Bulgogi in the past and that is always good... this time I got the spicy chicken (I forget what they call it) and the flavors were great, however it is dark meat chicken... so if you want white meat you might have to specify that. Also, any place that has homemade Ramen noodles on the menu is okay by me.

This place is a must try if you haven't had it before!

312 My boyfriend and his parents go here all the time. It is a cute little restaurant in Cecil PA . The owner is very sweet and she cooks everything by herself. She has about one person serving and it is advisable to call in advance. She cooks everything while you wait so expect to be there for a while. It is a great experience. The food is Korean and mildly spicy. We had some kind of pancake with Kimchi with a dry korean coleslaw as she cooked our entrees. She also served us green tea. I had some kind of teriyaki tofu with veges that was pretty good and my boyfriend had the kimchi shigae. It came in a huge hot pot and he loved. The rice was the most amazing she calls it special rice and IT IS special. All in all i love this place it is very private and a true gem in pittsburgh.

315 I wish I didn't come here for my first taste of Korean food cause it will make other places look like North Korea. I'm pretty sure the place can only seat like 10 people. It is in the middle of nowhere and pretty easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. The cook is a sweet lady who is concerned about your food preferences. With out even asking she wanted to know if i was vegan, didn't eat pork, or was avoiding red meat. That was a first for me at any restaurant.  Delicious bulgogi, awesome kimchi, great potato pancakes. Small place but feels extremely homey. The price is reasonable and worth the flavor and experience. Kim Jong Un should make a trip here. 

I will come back again for that Bulgogi.

317 Limited menu often leads to unlimited taste.  A very cozy if not small place in the middle of nowhere outside of the 'Burgh.  I have been here twice and neither time disappointed.  As you may have read one woman runs it all, so it does take some time for some dishes and it can get a bit pricey since you'll want to try everything.  The spicy chicken is legit and my Korean mother-in-law makes a very good version.  
Sometimes getting a seat is difficult, but you can do take-out.
Also it's BYOB so bring a bottle of soju (traditional Korean liquor that can be had from the big Wines and Spirits) and offer her a shot.  She did shots with my friends and I on my first visit.  All the dishes I've tried have been exactly the way they're supposed to taste and they are fresh.
Do yourself a favor and head out to Cecil for the best Korean meal in Pittsburgh.

320 Though a little far out of the city, great place to go for Korean food. Expect home-style cooking. When I went, I ordered Daeji Bulgogi which is essentially slices of marinated pork over rice. The beef was pretty good, perfectly marinated, and quite spicy as I liked it (preference). I also appreciated the larger portions that I was given (in comparison to other Korean joints that I've been to, where the amount of meat given was less than satisfying). The Kimchi pancake also ended up being pretty good ... not too oily but definitely most filling and you could actually taste the kimchi in it, which meant that that the amount of starch used was not excessive. Will be back ... I look forward to trying other dishes.

321 I love this place!! I love the owner, who you'll see any time you're there, and the fact that it's tiny just makes it feel more intimate. You have to get the kimchi pancakes. The soups are always awesome. I've had the ramen and kimchi soups, and my husband loved the egg drop soup which is waaaaay better than typical egg drop. It's has substance, not just cornstarch. My 6 year old always gets the roll (I can't remember what it's called) which is just veggies in the style of a sushi roll. It's very good though, and everything is fresh and made with a lot of passion and love.

They also have an assortment of imported drinks.


Tip: don't come in here or order food within 45 of closing, they just get to busy.

323 Oh I love Korean food! I was so excited and surprised to find such a well-reviewed Korean restaurant in Cecil!

The shop is TINY. There are seriously two tables and a bar that seats another 4 people maybe. I'd probably just take out next time. We walked in and weren't recognized by anyone for a good 10 minutes. When my husband asked if we should wait and if someone would take our order (we seriously didn't know how it worked) we were kinda dismissed - but I honestly think it might have been a slight language barrier. What he said came across as dismissive but I truly don't think he meant it that way. 

The service got much better as we went on. They were clearly swamped with take out orders. My husband and I shared the veggie pancake and I ordered the jap chae. The food was fresh and very authentic. They have a good variety and I will definitely come back and try more! Just probably take out next time.

324 One of my favorite places to eat.  Authentic Korean food is delicious.  I recommend the ramen, Kim bop, mandu , and bulgogi.  Pretty much everything is wonderful!

325 I really enjoyed my experience at Golden Pig. It is a small shop with maybe 10 seats inside, but there is additional seating outdoors at picnic tables. I ordered the beef bulgogi and my fiance got the buldak chicken. We shared an order of spicy ramen as well. Every order also comes with a complimentaty small appetizer platter with kimchi and asian coleslaw. I really liked the kimchi. This was the first time that I ever tried it. The spicy ramen was okay, but I felt that it was missing something. Perhaps a little soup base or salt. The beef bulgogi was absolutely delicious and I will be returning just for that. All in all, Golden Pig was an interesting little restaurant and I do look forward to returning.

326 Delicious Korean Food that is authentic, home cooked, and reasonably priced.  This place is out of the way for me, but well worth the trip.  It's a tiny place with a limited number of tables and seats about 12.  They do a considerable amount of take-out business, too.

The first thing you notice is that everyone is happy and well fed.  The owner is funny and very welcoming.  She explained that she prepares everything from scratch, and that her food is based on Southern Korean Cuisine.

We had the Jop-Cha and Buldak, but I want to hurry back and try the Man-Du, which is apparently very popular.  Along with your order, they bring 3 appetizers to your table, all very unique and tasty.

If you like to eavesdrop, you can hear every conversation in the room.  But everyone seems to be having a great time and they are enjoying the food.

327 Where do I start? The small environment is like you're eating in a grandma's kitchen. When they say spicy, they mean spicy! So delicious. They being you a beginner sampler plate of pickled radishes, sesame coleslaw & homemade kimchee. Ms. Kwon is a spectacular hostess & a genuinely nice woman. We'll definitely go back!

328 This is such a diamond in the rough!It is so small and quaint so I wanted to wait for the right time. I went in hungry and left full! The flavor was such a nice change compared to anything else I have had lately. I was greeted by a friendly woman and man. The woman was in the kitchen and the man was cleaning off all the little pigs they collect. He said he cleans them all every 2 weeks. That speaks volumes to me and I knew I was going to enjoy my meal.

I started off the Korean experience with the hot green pepper Korean pancake witch was amazing!!! The hot pepper sauce/ paste was so full of flavor and the pancake was fresh and hot! They also gave me a small plate with some kim chi and Korean style cole slaw.

Next, I had the Sae Woo Bo Kum (saut챕ed shrimp). This was my favorite dish and main entree. The flavors were so powerful and enjoyable. The ingredients were all fresh and cooked to perfection!

Finally, I also ordered the spicy ramen! It was full of flavor and the broth was amazing for my head cold. I did not finish the noodles but I did finish all the broth.

I highly recommend making a trip if you want fresh Korean cuisine. It is very small so keep that in mind during peak dinner hours.

329 This is a pretty good takeout Korean place.  There is seating for about 8 so it's mostly just takeout.  It's a bit out of the way for us or I'd likely stop in more often.  The sweet potato noodles were especially good.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but wouldn't put it on a list of the best places in the city.  Still, they aren't trying for that.  They are trying to be a mom & pop (literally) takeout joint and they excel at that.

330 My best friend and I had plans in Pittsburgh and wanted to eat some place that isn't a chain. We opted to try Golden Pig and loved it. I'm half Korean and the food was delicious and reminded me so much of my own family's cooking. Prices are extremely fair and the couple that runs this place are so nice! Highly recommend.

331 I kept hearing about the hype about how this was the most authentic and best Korean food in the area (some claim in southwestern PA??) and finally decided to make the drive out here from the city. Unfortunately, this dining experience probably gave me the largest ever deviation between expectation and result.

I'll cut straight to it--the food is not my type. Eat at an acclaimed Korean restaurant on the coasts, or if you're in the suburbs just make the reverse drive that I did into the city and go to a place like Korea Garden or Nak Won Garden. They're not mind-blowing, but I assure you they're much closer to what you'll find in NY or LA than Golden Pig is. We got the ramen to start--okay, we weren't expecting instant ramen, but fine it was $5 and somewhat hearty. As we waited for entrees, we never got our banchan, and no one came by to check on us or at least give us some water (for the record, other customers got the side dishes at the beginning, without asking). 

When the entrees came, we asked the guy (not the couple who owns the place) and he was somewhat apologetic for forgetting. The banchan consisted of a small plate with two pieces of random things like kimchi, potato, and broccoli (??). It wasn't amazing, but the biggest surprise was that each of us got one such plate. Go to any other authentic Korean place, and a table would get one portion of each side separately. Yes, it's the same food in the end, but the implication is entirely different--these sides are meant to be shared among the people dining together, and preparing them on separate plates individualized for each person signifies a huge shift in the dining experience. I understand that they might be trying to accommodate for customers who don't regularly eat this kind of food. At a certain level, both patron and restaurant have to adapt to different customs (and that's a good thing for intercultural mixing), but I felt that the owners went too far in this instance.

For the entrees, we got the daeji bulgogi and buldak, both of which were rather mediocre. They weren't terrible, but I've had better at the aforementioned places in Pittsburgh. The two main issues were that 1) there was too much sauce on both plates, and 2) there were few other seasonings or flavors. For 1), it appears from the Yelp pics for this place that they're not very consistent--some appear drenched in sauce, while others actually look appetizing. We got the former, and that probably led to 2); the only taste was spicy, and while there were some onion and carrot pieces their taste was basically overwhelmed by the sauce. Other than that, the sesame was probably a bit overdone, and some scallion would probably have helped a lot.

Despite all this though, I'm genuinely happy that this couple has made it this far. It's not always easy working such long hours as an immigrant family, but evidently they're making a lot of people happy. They've also put in a lot of work making the restaurant welcome to everyone (try to count how many pigs are inside if you go), so I hope they thrive as long as there are happy customers.

332 Very friendly environment, and yummy home style Korean food! I recommend the kalbi (short ribs), although on the pricey side ($20), it was very tender and enjoyable. Service was very quick. It would be a fantastic place to stop if passing by, but I wouldn't make the drive out if not in the area. There is only 2 tables and 5 squished counter seats, definitely a hole in the wall spot.

333 Food was decent. The quantity was way less though. We ordered the Pork and Kimchi Fried Rice ($9.95), Mandu -5 ($8.95), kimchi pancake ($7.95). We took the food to go and while checking out there seemed to be a mandatory tipping option. This brought our total to $35. This, for a meal for 2 people, for the quantity of food provided, I thought was very expensive for a takeout restaurant. I would not visit again. I don't understand all the good reviews out here.

334 Don't blink when you're driving down the road. You'll miss this great place. It's a small part of an unassuming building. Hanging out on the end of the building, this small store front, we are told, gets full quick during meal times. We came for a late lunch  just for that. Just three tables in the joint with a bar to sit when you want to watch the cooking or just talk to the owner. She's a real joy, who loves her food and what she does. I don't normally think of Korean BBQ in Pittsburgh but I'll be back.

335 Amazing. It doesn't get fresher than this.  I give the mandu two thumbs up. 

This restaurant only seats 10 -12 people. One lovely lady waits on you, cooks your food and delivers it.  It is a true dining experience. She brought us out some fresh cooked Korean vegetables. I love to try new foods.

Very small, but it is so quaint and warm inside. You feel comfortable immediately.

Take a chance and try this place....you won't be disappointed.

337 Have you ever had a home cooked Korean meal? If not, this is just the place to go to! Before visiting this place, consider if you're eating in or doing takeout. The restaurant itself is extremely small with two tables and counter area. So if you're eating in, arrive early or call ahead for takeout. We went there on Friday night and were doing takeout. We got lucky that we got in before the crowd started arriving which still took at least 20 minutes for our food to be ready. The place is very cozy and free parking is always a plus.

The food itself is pretty decent. We ordered kim bop (sushi), kimchi chi gae, egg soup and bugolgi. The egg soup was delicious and filled with flavor. As for the kim bop, I did enjoy it but it was small and there were more veggies more than anything. I also like the kimchi chi gae which was a bit spicy but very well seasoned. The only downside is that everything had small portions for the price.

338 Love this place - a must visit for any visitors or locals.  If I lived here, this would be my go-to spot! I especially remember a time the owner made me a special kimchi pasta dish, off menu as she knows how much I was enjoying her food.  Try it all - delicious and authentic.

339 I spent a year in Korea about twenty years ago and have not been able to find the spicy delicious meals that I had there... Until now! Ms. Kwon cooks authentic from scratch homemade meals that are incredible. The Raman is spicy and filling, loaded with fresh vegetable and plenty of heat! The fried rice is made to order and is packed with fresh veggies and comes with a side of cabbage and spicy radish. We ordered a small container of the kimchi that was so good, it didn't make it home! 
The place is small but comfortable, plenty of parking 
The owner and only employee that we saw, ms.kwon was kind and engaging. She helped me polish up on my Korean which after twenty years was a bit rusty.

342 My Fianc챕 and I just tried this place. We held off for a long while because we weren't sure if we would like Korean food. We are so upset we didn't try this sooner. We LOVE this place. We ordered the spicy chicken budlak (yes, it was spicy) and the mild ramen. We will definitely go back to the Golden Pig. What a gem in a small town!

343 This is the type of place that if it was closer to foot traffic and the city, you might never get to eat it cause of how busy it would be.  I ate the ramen bowl, vegetable pancake and the mandu, it was all flawlessly executed and served with a genuine enthusiastic smile by the owner and cook, Yong.  Perfectly priced, beyond fair.  If I lived closer I'd go once a week.  Worthy of whatever length of drive you need to make for the experience.  This is the type of place that won't be here forever as the owner expressed that when it's over, it's over, so go to at least say you did it before you can't ever again!

346 Absolutely loved this place. Got there with my wife just as it opened, which was good since it is tiny and only seats around a dozen. 

The owners were friendly. The food was good with a nice spice level. It was very filling. 

The only quibble I had was that I would appreciate if the menu was a little more descriptive of what the dishes were, since I'm not familiar with Korean food.

347 My family and I went to Golden Pig because it was recommended to us by some friends multiple times. Upon first entering, you can tell you're going to get an authentic, home made meal. It's just the husband and wife who are there doing everything, which was incredibly impressive and admirable. You can tell they really enjoy cooking for people, and they're also so incredibly kind. Many people came in and out of the restaurant who were good friends with the owners, and seeing their interactions were so sweet.

As many other reviews have probably mentioned, the restaurant is extremely small. Definitely try and go at an off time in order to get a seat. You'll also find that a lot of people put in to-go or pick up orders, so even if there aren't many other people dining in, your food could still take a little longer than expected. However, our food still got out to us pretty fast! No complaints. The meal also starts off with a small plate of kimchi, pickled radish, broccoli with some type of sauce, and Korean coleslaw so you can snack on it if your food takes a bit of time! They were all so yummy- I ate half while waiting for my food and half with the appetizers and my entree.

For food we ordered the Fried Potatoes, Egg Soup, and the Korean Pancake with Veggies and Hot Pepper as appetizers. The Potatoes were nothing to shake a stick at. The egg soup was good, but it was better when we added the hot sauce to it. The best part of the soup were the giant chunks of egg in it! The pancake was incredible- would definitely get again, maybe next time with kimchi. 

For our entrees, I got the Saut챕ed Tofu and Veggies. It wasn't overly flavorful, but I did really love how they prepared the tofu (pan fried as opposed to fried in a fryer like most places). It was pretty garlicky which I really liked, and the veggies were bright and perfectly cooked. My mom and sister got the Saut챕ed Shrimp and neither one of them was crazy about it- overall not super flavorful. They preferred mine. My dad got the Kalbi, and while it wasn't what he expected, he thought it was excellent. We also shared a Veggie Fried Rice, which was good but not as amazing as the people in the restaurant told us as they were leaving. It was good paired with our entrees, but I don't think I would've enjoyed it alone.

Overall this restaurant was great! Definitely an experience and some of the best (and maybe only) Korean food you'll find in the area.

348 5 stars because we were already planning our next trip before we finished eating our meal.

Who would think the best Korean place in Pittsburgh would be way out in Cecil?  This might be the teeniest place ever but wow is it big on taste! 

We went at 2pm on a Monday so even though it was tiny (only seats about 11 people total) and I'm sure it gets packed, there were only 2 other (very friendly) people in there that were finishing up and leaving.  It seems like they have a lot of regulars.  The owners (?) behind the counter taking our order and cooking were very nice.

Down low on the food:  the Korean pancake was ginormous and so good.  We got the vegetable but added some hot pepper too and then mixed the 2 sauces (chili paste&something else) at the table to dip it in and it added just the right amount of heat and extra flavor.  Also ordered the bulgogi and for some reason on the hottest day of the year my sister wanted the spicy mackerel tofu soup. He warned us when ordering it was fishy (which we expected and it was) but it also was chock full of other goodies like tofu and kimchi and super flavorful.  The banchan they serve with your order was awesome!

High five to the lady I was talking to at the Korean food bazaar that turned me on to this place :-) can't wait to come back!

349 I've been to a TON of Korean restaurants in my time and will say this place is not as good as folks say. First, size DOES matter... This place is so small that it is uncomfortable. Seriously. I have never dined in a public place this tiny and dirty. I assume that because this business is shoehorned in a cinder block bunker there is no place to store cleaning agents but in full sight of customers. I was literally rubbing elbows with some stranger and neither one us was happy about it... Second, don't bother asking for water unless you want to pay for bottled. I needed to take a prescription pill and was lectured about how they don't have glasses for water. Seriously? I stood my ground and was brought room temperature tap water in a styrofoam cup. Nice. Onto the food. I had the kimchi pancakes. They were what one would expect. I then ordered gimbop. It was average. We also shared a vegetable fried rice. It
 was average. I asked for hot sauce and the owner flipped out on me. Informed me that hot sauce will ruin the dish...thanks for the lecture, but I like my food spicy and I'm paying for it...so...give me hot sauce sans lecture. To drive 40 minutes from the city to get jammed into this ugly space to eat average Korean is not my idea of a culinary experience. I suppose if my car breaks down in Cecil I might be back to the Golden Pig. Otherwise, there are better options.

355 This is a tiny restaurant on Queen-Mary, but the service is so warm and friendly that you feel like you've been invited to your best friend's house for a special meal.  My favorite dish was the fried eggplants stuffed with crab and cheese, something I've never tried elsewhere. The fried curry cod  entree was also very original.  The decor is not fancy but it is extremely clean.  The meal and the service were so amazing I would happily return again.

The sake ice cream is surprising and a prefect touch of sweet to end a meal.

Highly recommended.

357 Another great addition to the area. The pork soup was fantastic on par with some other spots in the city if not better. The noodle dish at lunch with the BBQ beef was so good, too bad they don't have it on their nightly menu. I wasn't too crazy about the noodle dish on their regular menu I wish they would swap it for the BBQ one. The woman working there is very friendly and hospitable.

361 I wanted to try Jumak for quite some time and I'm not disappointed. The place can allow about 20 people. The menu is presented with a scroll, nice way to display a menu.

There were no one when I arrived. I've ordered a seafood pancake (haemul pajeon), a pork bone soup (gamja tang) and a spicy tofu and seafood soup. 

All were delicious. Overall I'm satisfied with this Korean restaurant. The only thing that you need to be aware is that they don't accept credit card.

365 Family owned and only a few months new. They serve authentic korean food and aren't  afraid to explain what's  in dishes. The food is seasoned perfectly and I could taste everything rather it being overwhelmed with seasoning like some other places I've  been. It is super afforable and really great atmosphere. They also have this amazing lunch special for korean bbq from 12 - 2:30. I absolutely have to come back and try it!  I came for the beef and kimchi dolsot bimbim bap and the hotteok. The hotteok is a must try! Absolutely delicious withot being overwhelmingly sweet. Their kimchi was delicious and most of their dishes are made with a hand made house sauses. Because it is homemade there is a comfort in the food. Seriously, this is now going to be one of my favourite local korean food places to go to. The staff is very friendly and attentive. You will honestly not be disappointed.

368 Like korean restaurants, their menu consists of the regular korean dishes for a reasonnable price, such as bibimbap, fried chicken, etc. 

I tried the spicy chicken Cup bap which had chicken, japchae, rice and salad. It's was pretty good but wasn't really spicy. The side dishes were ok, but the kimchi was saltier than expected. 

The place itself is clean and cozy. The waiter was nice and friendly. 

Overall, I don't have much to say about this restaurant. It was good but not good enough for me to go back.

369 It's rare I find such a gem of a restaurant that I can pass up or avoid reviewing. 
It's that good!

For a small, reasonably priced spot, Jumak really delivers on taste & quality. 
You are served immediately with the regular appetizers, and their homemade kimchi is outstanding. It's based on their family recipe, and it's the perfect balance of salty and spicy. Very refreshing! 

My favourite dish is usually dolsot bibimbap, but this time I had a spicy pork dish called cup bap.

It's so worth the visit, I highly recommend you try it out!

371 I am so mad at myself for not taking pictures, but I was starving when I arrived and had left ordering to my sister and friend. We shared a number of items including the lunch special bulgogi, fried chicken with sweet french fries (really like a honey glaze), sun dubu jjigae, donkatsu kimbap, and haemul pajeon. Then we also shared one coconut hotteok and one brown sugar hotteok.The pajeon (seafood pancake) is out of this world good, the sun dubu is one of my all time favorites though. I also really liked the fried chicken, sweet fries, and coconut hotteok. The other items were really good too, those were just my personal favorites. Banchan was simple: seaweed slices, grated daikon, and some stellar home-made kimchi. I'll be back as soon as possible, this is going to be my new go-to restaurant for soul-warming Korean food.
*If you want to see some more examples of their food, their FB page has a bunch.*

375 *3.5 rating*

After reading all the hype about this place I was really eager to try it out. It's a little restaurant with about 10 tables. 

We were greeted with tea, seaweed, green beans and kimchi. For the main course, being a huge bibimbap fan, I ordered the beef bibimbap along with the beef Cupbap. Bibimbap is a very popular Korean dish served with rice, vegetables and an egg in a hot stone bowl. The beef Cupbap was served with sweet potato noodles & rice and heavily dressed with a sauce. Of the two, the bibimbap was definitely a better choice. Both dishes can have more meat especially the Cupbap which hardly had any meat. 

 I have had much better Korean meals and would say this one was decent.

380 Korean is my go to comfort food so I'm always up for trying Korean! 

The resto is small seats about 24 at full capacity. The walls are decorated with asian fans and pics of food.  We got a table at the front window and ordered on their scroll menus. Btw, it's a cash and debit place.  We ordered the seafood pancake, a bulgogi beef cup bap and a soup and noodle with beef.  

The seafood pancake had shredded sweet potato, lots of onions, some zucchini and a little hint of chili peppers. It's very light in texture. The taste was great as a veggie pancake but there were only microscopic amounts of seafood. I found a tiny shrimp and a shred of squid. I would've liked more seafood. The bulgogi cup bap was good, reminds me of the vegetarian rice bowls with dressing but with meat.  One thing I noticed was that they don't use Korean styled rice completely. It looks like the rice is a blend of the short grain rice with long grain white.  This changes the flavor a bit. I prefer my short grain rice straight :)  The banchan was delicately flavored with shredded daikon, kimchi and seaweed sheets.  The daikon was really good so I got seconds.

The price is very reasonable so if you're in the neighborhood and looking for modern Korean and fast service, this is the place.

381 I have mixed feelings on this place for my first visit. I reserved for 5 without knowing how big this place is. We turned out to be six sitting at a table for 4. Kinda tight. My girl and I enjoy discovering foods. We loved the octopus balls. Dumplings were a little too crunchy. I'm used to steamed. I had the bibim something. Quite tasty but I screwed up and drank my miso instead of pouring it in. My bad. I gotta try it again. My friend had a large soup. She really enjoyed it especially with her cold. The others had mixed feelings especially with a really late plate. They enjoyed themselves because of the company but indifferent about the food. One had pork chops which looked like Shaken Bake. I think she should have ordered better. 
Bring cash or debit No CC. 4 people tops. Order the specialties. Don't be rushed Repeat!

382 New Gem on queen mary you have to try, new and not yet discovered. Food is excellent and affordable! Authentic Korean cuisine offering all the dishes you crave with cool music.
The chef /owner and his wife front of house offers gracious service while the chef cooks some of the most flavorful foods. We've been here 3 times trying everything from the delicious miso cod, seafood pancake (huge!) and yummy gizzards to start. Perfect 'dolsot bibim bap' and 'jiam bbong' and oh so good tofu soup 'Sun dubu jjige'.

385 I've come here many times over the last couple months. Their menu isn't extremely long compared to some other Korean restaurants, but everything I've tried so far has been delicious. 

They have some of the tastiest takoyaki I've tried in Montreal and their kimchi pancake is delicious. They are also one of the few places in Montreal that offer Cupbap. I got to try their friend chicken during my most recent visit and I really liked it; it was very juicy. Their fries are also a little sweet, if you're into that. I highly recommend this place for some down-to-earth Korean food. 

The only minus I've found so far is that they don't accept credit card, only cash and debit.

386 When I first entered the restaurant I was amazed by the warmth and intimacy of the place, especially when located on such a live street like Queen Mary. 

For appetizers, we had eggplant dumplings and the very famous seafood pancake. For mains, we decided to go with the pork and vegetable rice bowls. Needless to mention all of them were delicious, though a bit too oily. 

Also, the waitress was super nice and patient. Would definitely recommend!

387 I just love this Korean place, better than the ones downtown. Food is absolutely delicious. I have been here twice and want to go back to try the rest of the menu. I love their papyrus menu hehehe. It is a small place, but the couple of times I have been there, it is not packed, so you will find easily a table.

388 I was so happy to get to go visit Jumak. I'd been curious about the reviews I'd seen coming in on Yelp and waiting for an opportunity. I have a bestie who lived in Korea for a couple years and I owed her a favour so I took her out for a dinner date on Queen Mary. When we got there we made friends with Jo who is co-owner and runs front of house. She was excited and proud of the food and rattled off her favourite suggestions and my friend's eyes lit up. We ordered a vegetarian pajeon, eggplant dumplings, a spicy noodle soup and the pork rice cup. Everything was honestly exceptional.

The eggplant dumplings were a delicate surprise- they were thin pieces of eggplant rolled around creamy crab meat and fried - lovely. The pajeon was surprisingly light and not greasy and I could have eaten that spicy noodle soup forever. 

This is a Mom and Pop shop run by a young cool couple who are working their butts off to provide really high quality Korean food, exceptional warm kind service, at fair prices. They are doing a great job, go give them some love!!

389 There is something about the way streets and sidewalks are set up in some parts of Montreal that make it difficult for the usual passer-by to notice certain storefronts. Perhaps it is because people have their heads down or looking straight ahead, trying to get from point a to point b. Sadly, this means that some really quality spots get totally overlooked, and I would have to say Jumak is one of those places. 

This place has been around for roughly 8 months, and it's only really because of Yelp (haaaaay!) that Jumak fell on my radar. And finally, my partner and I had a little free time during lunch (and some errands to run nearby) and decided to give it a try. 

Now I grew up in Koreatown Los Angeles, arguably the most Korean city in North America. So I have moderate expectations. And I have been let down. Thankfully, Jumak did not disappoint. 

The restaurant is a cleanly, simply decorated place that seats about 20 people or so. The server was super nice and helpful. And the food was SOLID. We ordered the seafood soon du bu and bulgogi bibimbap. The soon du bu was perfectly spicy with a nice seafood-y twang. The bibimbap was clean, had a great portion of meat (sometimes places only have a little bit of meat). Both we delicious and hot devoured. 

This place deserves more popularity. Maybe a more eye catching sign and/or A-frame on the sidewalk. I hope the summertime brings out the outdoor tables and sidewalk curiosity. Can't wait to come back!

390 Love love love this place! When my friend and I got inside this really small restaurant, we no expectations what's so ever. We ordered my favorite Korean sweet potato noodles with some fried chicken and a soup with a massive beef bone in it (That was impressive! Very tasty!!! ).
The fried chicken was so good! They serve it with fries. Careful, it's addictive! If my friend wasn't there, I would've eaten it all by myself! 
This place can maybe seat 20 people max. It's really cozy and the staff was really fast on the service. I'm definitely going back to try some other things!

food and service was awesome.... the wait and the loudness was crap

393 YOu need a reservation or else you'll be waiting a long time outside. The decor is a bit tacky and it's dirty. The tables, chairs and menus were dirty and sticky. I did like the concept of this restaurant.
So much things to choose from and it doesn't come in big quantity so you can taste a lot of things without being to full.

Personally I didn't like the food, everything tastes the same, some kind of spice or something. Not a great choice of alcohol, shots were super expensive. The wine was good :)

If you wanna try something new, this is a place for you!

394 I think Korean bbq just hasn't caught on here yet. For an all you can eat restaurant the quality of the meat was fantastic. Sapporo pitchers are reasonably priced and the service was excellent, our multi lingual waiter Sam was a breath of fresh air and super attentive.  I am a fan of this place. My only suggestion, get garlic!!! Lol If there was garlic I would have given an extra star.

396 Since this is Montreal, I didn't have high expectations for Korean bbq, but I wanted to give this place a try cus my friends here were so curious about it. The marinade was definitely not Korean....more like Chinese diluted to adhere to the typical sweetness of western food. It tasted cheap. I advise people to get drunk so you can forget about the bland taste and just keep eating. As I looked around, I felt bad for the people who are eating this, thinking this is actually Korean. I gave it one more star only because the price is relatively cheap: but remember that you get what you pay for.

397 I've been going to this restaurant for about 4 years now with my boyfriend.  We love this place so much! It's such a fun experience and the meat-especially the beef..is the best! Would definitely recommend. Only thing that I think could make it even better is different sauces for the meats and and side dishes! Other than that never been disappointed and it's a really cool place to go on night out in MTL!

400 I've been here twice and like the atmosphere.
It has a nice decor and creative concept.
All-You-Can-Eat Buffet, Reasonably priced.
Great if you have a big appetite
They also have a late night buffet that starts at 11pm (15$) but keep in mind, there are less choices on the menu. Definitely try the mango ice cream ! Good choice for a first date. Social environment, perfect for get togethers with friends & families as well as groups.

402 Un peu avant Noel, mon ami et moi avons un souper longuement et de multiples fois report챕: du BBQ Cor챕en. Maintenant, je commence en disant que ce n'est pas du BBQ Cor챕en authentique selon les fanatiques exag챕r챕s mais on s'en fou.... non non, vraiment on s'en fou! C'est bon? Oui, C'est cher? Non, C'est frais? Oui. Belle carte pas complique, 20-30 choix d'accompagnement pour l'aspect BBQ, des sushis (Je n'en ait pas manger, mais ils ont l'air ok, rien de wow, mais tr챔s hon챗te.) Du Poulet Pop Corn, et quelques autres trucs. Je parle du poulet pop corn parce que c'챕tait d챕licieux. Le prix ? 21.99$ pour un repas a volont챕 et 14.99$ a volont챕 le vendredi soir. VEN-DRE-DI! hey c'est pas l'arnaque du moins cher le mercredi entre 15h et 18h ou une merde du genre. Nah nah nah, toute la soir챕e. Je vais y retourn챕 c'est 100% certain. 

Ah mais comment 챌a marche? Tu prends ta carte, tu mets des num챕ros et une quantit챕 dessus, le/la serveur/se l'am챔ne en moins de 5 minutes, t'as une plaque bbq au centre de la table et tu fais cuir ton lunch.  Tr챔s bon service, rapide et courtois, je le recommande.

405 Don't come here for the service. Why would you when you have a ton of delicious food to grill?? The servers are basically only there to bring you the food you order. Sometimes you may have to ask them for an order they forgot or may not have but let's focus on the experience.
We went for dinner on a weekday and it came up to about $33 all in. For that price you're able to order an array of meat, fish and veggies to grill (all seem to be great small portion cuts). Included as well are an assortment of sushi rolls, sashimi, appetizers and desserts!
You won't feel rushed while enjoying grilling your slightly marinated meats (use the soy sauce for  more flavour) and you will definitely get your fill.
Great idea for date nights or with friends!

406 Si j'avais 횪 r챕sumer le Seoul Chako en un seul mot, je choisirais celui-l횪 : Gargantuesque. 
 
L'endroit est un BBQ cor챕en avec service 횪 volont챕. Ce qui veut dire qu'on fait cuire les aliments soi-m챗me sur un gril install챕 au centre de la table. Le tout est aliment챕 par un flot pratiquement ininterrompu de b흹uf, de saumon, de calmar, de porc marin챕 et/ou de crevette servis (d챕vers챕?) 횪 votre table selon la quantit챕 demand챕e. Voici donc l'endroit de pr챕dilection dans le centre-ville pour les gros app챕tits.

Dans l'ensemble, les aliments sont offerts dans une assez grande diversit챕 et dans une fraicheur tr챔s correcte. Certaines aliments sont marin챕es, d'autres, tel que le saumon ou le calmar, sont servis tel quel. Pour ma part, j'aimerais voir au menu beaucoup plus de type de marinade. Apr챔s tout, il s'agit de l'une des forces de la cuisine Cor챕enne, non ? 

Points forts : La quantit챕, la quantit챕, la quantit챕. La c척te de b흹uf marin챕e est excellente. Le concept est relativement unique que l'on ne voit jamais ailleurs dans les restos canadiens. 

Les points n챕gatifs : Le service est parfois d챕sorganis챕. Les soirs de fin de semaine, attendez 횪 faire la file. La prise de r챕servation semble relativement chaotique car j'ai souvent vu des clients argument챕 avec le placier les soirs de grande affluence. Le choix de viande marin챕e est assez limit챕. Pas de Soju disponible (c'est un resto Cor챕en, non???). L'ambiance rappel un peu les restos fast-food. Surtout, on 챕vite la pour un rendez-vous romantique. 

Somme-toute, c'est une assez bonne exp챕rience culinaire ax챕 sur la quantit챕, voir sur les exc챔s de table. On vient surtout ici avec son groupe d'ami affam챕 par une froide soir챕e d'hiver pour se goinfrer, s'empiffrer et prendre quelques livres.

407 First, Seoul Chako is pricey. It costs more for dinner than for lunch but you get a much bigger selection as well as a friendlier staff if you're willing to wait and pay more. 

It is mainly a place to socialize with a group of friends. It gets noisy at times but it's about what you would expect at a BBQ. Also, the restaurant is usually rather full and the waiters might take a while to notice you. The food itself is nothing to rave about, but they offer a nice selection of a bit of everything. For meat lovers, the short ribs and white fish are particularly delicious. The food can burn quickly so it is especially important to change the grill every so often when it starts to stick. 

Overall, it's a good place to fill your stomach with meat and chat with friends.

409 There are some great things about this place, and some terrible things.

GOOD:
the menu selection is so big!
I love the cook-your-own-meat. 
the sushi isn't bad for an all-you-can-eat
the sushi pizza is goooooooood

BAD:
the service - they sometimes forget things you ordered, and sometimes ignore your table
the price - $25 AND a charge if you don't finish things 
the portions are pretty small, but I guess you can order more
there's no special treatment, the service will put down your dishes anywhere on the table (so you have to put them in front of whoever ordered them) and walk away immediately

Overall, it's a fine experience if you are willing to pay a fair bit to eat for a while, or if you eat a lot.

410 The food was mostly good, portions are good most of the time but since is a buffet doesn't really matter for the most part. That being I don't think that it's worth it for the price, it's not the only Korean BBQ in town and the quality could be better. The service was not good. The waiter didn't come every time we ask something, and he seem like he didn't understand when we spoke. I think is important for waiters for speak French as well since I had to translate for my friends.

411 Can I get service?!? No really, I don't know what the hell happened but I was curious to try it out for lunch so I lined up 10 minutes prior to opening.  Finally getting seated, I immediately wrote down what I wanted...and waited...and waited...everyone else was getting served. I didn't even receive my water while the table next by was already grilling their stuff. What terrible service!  I left after waiting a solid 15 minutes.  Went else where. Awful service. They didn't even apologize.

412 I think that for what we pay, Seoul Chako is quite good. The meats are well marinated and seasoned, and there is a good selection. The reason why I only give 3 stars is for 2 main reasons, the first being the service. Last time, we had to ask 4 times for our gril to be changed before it was changed (we waited more than 20 minutes). The restaurants wasn't event that busy when it happened. Also, it happened quite a few times that not all the items we ordered came out. The second reason is the most important I believe. Me and my friends asked for chocolate ice cream. When it came out, I took a spoonfull, and spit it right away; the ice cream tasted like shit. I belive it was expired. 
Would coma again, but will never order chocolate ice cream ever again.

414 I don't know what all the fuss is about! Seoul Chako way surpassed my expectations.

The meat was absolutely delicious, so juicy and tender and the selection is amazing! The ox tongue is my favourite for anyone daring enough to try (one thing however is that I kept ordering the octopus and it never showed up both times I've been there, perhaps they should take this off the menu)

On top of the meats they offer to BBQ yourself, there is also a good selection of delicious sushi, grill-able vegetables and Korean appetizers to choose from. 

For dessert definitely try a round of strawberry forzen yogurt with vanilla icecream. And then get their mango pudding.

416 I thought I'd feel really cheated in grilling my own meat, I was wrong it's super fun! The only previous Korean BBQ experience I've had, the waiter grilled everything in front of us, it was delicious..and awkward.
Turns out Seoul Chako has grills embedded in tables so you are the grill master! 

Sadly that was where the fun ended for us. The vibe is odd: they obviously want to be this cool lounge, but it's essentially a buffet, so expect a loud, continuous flow of employees bussing dirty plates everywhere. The selection is good, but you'll be lucky if you end up with what you ordered! Our pork became pork belly, we got less veggies than advertised on the menu, if we got them at all, and the pineapple order will get you one (1) slice. That's it! Our waitress was super efficient otherwise, so efficient that around 10:00pm she ducked down below our table to turn off our grill.. 15 minutes later she explained the kitchen would be closing. The food is good, but the portions are somewhat small, which is to be expected, so get the most of your $27!

417 Mmmmm Korean BBQ:) I first discovered it while living in  LA and I took to it instantly!

Ahh the aroma of chargrilled meat, tender, marinated, smoky perfection dipped in spicy, tasty sauces, definitely one of my favorites:)

I fiound Seoul Chako by chance and what a discovery it was!

I was on my way to Grummun 78 to pick up a few tacos and was lucky enough to find parking a block away. As I got out of my car, the heavenly smell of charcoaled meat grabbed my attention, I looked around to see where it was coming from and right infront of my car was Seoul Chako.

They had a little terasse outside which was packed with people grilling their meat so I decided to check out the menu at the front door which mentioned an all you can eat lunch time buffet.

I'm not really a buffet girl, although I love food, I don't eat a ton but the smell and my memories of korean BBQ made me go in.

The host told me that the lunch time buffet ended at 3pm, it was now 2:30, so he said that I would only be able to order once.

I sat down at a table, my centre piece grill was lit and he gave me my little form to fill out my choices

For 13.99$ you get your pick of a variety of cuts of beef, chicken and shrimp is also on the menu.

A few salads, sushi and green tea of mango ice cream for desert.

I have always had eyes bigger then my mouth and suddenly I felt starved. I asked my waiter how much meat was on a plate and he said 4 pieces, which didn;t sound like much. 

I ordered 2 plates of meat, a plate of chicken, 2 bowls of rice, a California roll, a salad and a vegetable plate. 

I paid my bill in advance, I am not  really a patient type of girl, once I'm done eating, I like to run.

I then started reading through the menu again and saw a note at the bottom saying, do not waste food, you will be charged a 1$ for each wasted piece,

hmmmmmm....maybe I was a little greedy and piggish and ordered a little too much? 

Within a few minutes my waiter is back with a scary amount of food!


4 plates of meat, yes 4, not the 2 I ordered, a plate of chicken, 2 rice bowls, sushi and salad and me in a booth....

I started slinking down in my seat, feeling very piggish, how the hell am I going to eat all this??

That thought was quickly cast aside and I started digging

 into my meal....

I arranged some meat, onions and mushrooms on my grill and started on my little salad..

A pretty simple one but fresh, crisp chunks of lettuce with a tasty dressing, nothing special but still good.

The sushi was your typical California roll, I had one piece then pushed it aside,

Back to my meat....In a nuthshell, melt in your mouth goodness, rich, well marinated with just the right amount of marbling to make it delicious!

After finishing one plate of meat and rice, I started feeling nervous, I cannot eat all this and I cannot just leave it all on the table!

There was a group of guys behind me eating, who just asked the waiter for more meat but it was past 3, so no meat for you:)

I popped my head over and asked them, do you guys want my meat? They gave me a weird look but said yes.

My table was still overloaded and I was stuffed, so I cooked the rest and decided to bring it home to my shih tzu.


My stomach was full but I was in the mood for something sweet, so I ordered the mango ice cream, to finish things off:)

It came within a few minutes,  a perfect little portion in a cute little square bowl,

Sweet, fruity, creamy goodness, great finish to all the meat.

All in all, a delicious treat, I will be back, this time with company:)

419 Seoul Chako is one of these places I've been to many times, and liked less and less.
When I came to Montreal, I thought it was great, mainly because I never had Korean BBQ. 
It was a great place to grab dinner with friends, especially if they never really had Korean BBQ either. The food was on average acceptable, but not very authentic (the owners are Chinese). After a visit or two, I already knew to avoid certain meat cuts, and to stick to a few crowd favorites (and also that my clothes would smell of BBQ for days). 

One downside is the lack of vegetables. There's not much except mushrooms, bell pepper and zucchini. Another weakness is the service. They are usually understaffed, and it's difficult to get serviced sometimes. They also tend to bring incomplete orders or, at worst, to forget them altogether. As with other all you can eat places such as Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, it's safer to order everything you want to eat on the first order. Otherwise, I haven't had many bad experiences at Seoul Chako over the years, although I did find a dead ant in my mango jelly once (the staff promptly apologized and brought me a new one).

There are certainly more authentic and better quality Korean BBQ in town (e.g. Chez Hwang). But if you're looking for a loud, cheap-ish, straightforward place to eat a lot of meat, then I guess Seoul Chako is okay.

420 The raw food were prepared great but with poor explanation and very poor service. 
We arrived at 10:30and been told we only can do last shot so why not we were fine and glad to obey the rule.
However they gave us the bill which we paid immediately before all food delivered except the deserts and ask for tips twice! How horrible someone kept asking for your money! I said I will leave it on the table.. And they just kept ask for that!!!! How creepy! 
I will not recommend to anyone who want to enjoy his/her dinner or lunch . 

FYI they served DIY BBQ so you have to cook it yourself I am fine with that cause I am from canton. But I felt confused the time I walked in . No one tell me what s going on there! I thought it s a full service restaurant.

421 I only liked 2 things from the menu ALOT when I first came, which was the rib steaks and chicke filet. They were incredibly flavorful and fully loaded with an awesome and tasty marination and sooo juicy  . Everything else was very bland. I didn't like any of the sushi specialties,  just the regular cucumber and avocado makis which were nice and refreshing. 

The second time i went, we felt everything was tasteless, and the avocado was a bit browned :(
My friend didn't like the saki, it was very vinagery. I haven't tried a saki I liked yet, so I wouldn't know.  And the side order of spicy mayo wasn't spicy at all, tasted like mayo with food coloring    :(

And the service was very poor in the begining at our 2nd time. I wasn't too happy about just arriving like 20 min before the lunch time they stated, and yet still get charged for dinner, which is the same thing but for 2x$. They should have written it at the right time. Also a waiter told us to pay right after we ordered our first round because he was ending his shift, so we had to split his tip with the next waiter, instead of paying a full tip each, which would have been double for us, my friend was upset about that. Near the end a really good worker began his shift, and he was taking our plates very fast, so my friend decided to give the tip to him.

She doesn't want to go back there. I was disapointed at what was awesome last time, tasted completely different this time.

422 If you like meat, this is a place that you should definitely try. All you can eat BBQ and sushi! Because it's an AYCE place, the service is average because the poor waiters are always so busy. I wouldn't wear anything expensive or precious to the restaurant, as the smell of BBQ will intensely get through your clothes. 
As for the food, only some of the meats, like the beef and short ribs, are really worth your time and money as they taste the best. But, try a bit of all of them for fun, we've done that before and we liked it. The sushi is mediocre at best, but we like to get some to eat with our savoury beef to balance out the flavours. Sushi has a lot of rice in it, so don't order too much at once or you won't be able to finish them all!

427 The best place for all you can eat Korean BBQ in Montreal. The only items that are worth raving about is the Salmon Sashimi and the BBQ Short Ribs! Everything else is a waste of space in my stomach. The service is slow, but that's normal in all-you-can eat places. value/quality versus price is off the charts if you have a large appetite like myself.

428 C'est d챕s meilleure restaurants dans le cartier chinois. Ils accueillent beaucoup de clients et le service est en moyenne RAPIDE  ( la dur챕e d'attentes est de 5-10 minute) le temps que vous finissez de terminer le ou les premiers plats .Boom la troisi챔me commande est d챕j횪 sur la table. Excellent les serveurs sont multiservices est bilingue pour la plupart  ( fran챌ais, anglais). Venez en groupe de 6 et vous avez un rabais de 30% c'est pas g챕nial 챌a. Le co청t du buffet n'est absolument pas ch챔re!

429 I saw the reviews, but I thought I should give it a chance. I went here with my family, and we should have listened to the reviews. First, it's expensive. Second, they don't serve authentic korean food. To top it all of, the service is horrible. Orders were missing, and we asked some waiter for help and he said I'm not your waiter look for your waiter. The meat selection was horrible, and the meat didn't even taste good. I expected better quality or at least better service for the price they charge. Do yourself a favor and look for any other restaurant

TL;DR

Cons:
-meat selection
-service
-food quality
-taste

Pros:
-TBD

430 I have been here a few times and they have consistently forgotten our orders. We even waited for 30 minutes last time when they asked us to leave without serving us. 

In addition, the waitress will make a scene about being badly tipped so I kindly explained that it's the second time we waited over 30 mins for our orders because the waitress for our orders again...it may be cheap but you can't expect good service. 
Lower your expectations and you'll be impressed.

431 Worst service ever. Took long for servers to take orders. Waiters were not attentive. Glasses were empty. No one even paid attention. And difficult to flag anyone down to get a refill. Waiter used his hands to fill glass with ice and when an ice cube fell on the counter he picked it right back up and placed it in a cup. Many items that were ordered weren't brought to the table. They even ran out of food. How do you even run out of chicken?? You're a restaurant that is all you can eat. Beware they tacked on a 15% service charge for their LACK of service. And we were not a group.

432 An all you can eat Korean BBQ which you grill yourself. A great experience sharing food among friends. Their system of ordering food using a tablet was very efficient. However, service is somewhat slow sometimes. Price is also a bit high. Their food really shines through and everything tasted fresh. I would come back again.

433 Great food, amazing experience! Definitely worth a try and worth the money. I especially felt I needed to write this because other reviewers are complaining that they had to 'cook your own food'.. that's like going to play golf and complaining about having to swing your own club..

434 Having experienced Korean BBQ before in major US cities and a few times in Toronto. I was really looking forward to see what all-you-can-eat Seoul Chako had to offer my taste buds. 

Lets start by complimenting the trendy atmosphere they have created with an inviting dining area, music playing in the background and lights dimmed just right. Seating area is a mix of tables and booths and all designed with built-in natural gas BBQ grills where the main action takes place. The staff is well coordinated during busy hours, friendly and mostly english speaking. Now for the menu... 

Where most Korean restaurants would require a tour guide to walk you thru the complexity of their menu. This one is kept simple with a few choices of marinated and non marinated slices of meat, shellfish, a limited option on appetizers / side dishes (normally called Banchan) and only one soup option (two if you didn't know miso was Japanese). Everything is served with steamed rice, one spicy sauce (Ssamjang) and a lack of all the common condiments like fresh garlic you would find elsewhere. Also, the popular way of eating Korean BBQ is with lettuce wraps but unfortunately this will cost you an extra $1.50 per order. Sliced lamb is also available on the evening menu over the weekend. Sushi is also on the weekend menu but at this point I would stick with the Korean stuff. If not familiar with Korean BBQ you want to order ALL appetizers / side dishes and mostly stick with beef, short ribs and pork for a great meal.

Although an overall good experience the menu itself could use a little more authentic Korean options. They just recently open so there's room for improvement and get their liquor license issue straightened.

Great...
All-you-can-eat and do it yourself experience. 

No so great...
Lettuce and beverages are extra's. May rush you out on a busy Saturday night. Avoid tables near the front door or really close to a speaker if this is an intimate night out.

435 Ahhh the disappointment! Anyone who knows Korean BBQ knows that the meat must be served with lettuce in order to make your wrap that consists of meat and rice. It's part of the dish. Seoul Chako likes to charge extra for lettuce! I can't believe it! That's like going to an Italian restaurant and ordering a plate of pasta but getting charged extra for the tomato sauce. I don't understand how they can serve a dish but charge you extra to enjoy it the way it's supposed to be eaten. The quality of the meat isn't the greatest either. The waiters are arrogant and the place in itself is pretty disorganized. I don't think I saw my waiter smile once the entire evening. 

If you want really good Korean BBQ, the way it's supposed to be served and enjoyed, hit up Shabu Shabu on St. Jacques in N.D.G. It's 10x better.

436 The food is nice, there's no doubt I will always be a fan of their meat, but it is unfortunate to say that the service there is mediocre. 1) None of the staff speak french. 2) sometimes you have to wait firever after your first order and at the end there's missing pieces. The waiters just want you to leave, they have the worst service ever. I'm giving a 3/5 star for the food, but If I could rate the service, it will be a big zero out if 5.

437 First off, i want to start by mentionning that i went here for lunch around 2pm ! Apparently its very different from dinner. Nonetheless i somewhat like it, here`s the gist : Fun & classy deco with comfortable dinner type/lounge benches - big wide tables & cool blueish/eclectic lighting .
 
How it works : you sit down, look at the menu & write down on a little note pad available to you on the table with pencils, the number of the item of foods you want & their quantity. Example : Lets say grilled beef is numer 15 on the menu, you write down 15 & next to it 1 or 2 depending on the portion you want !
You can choose a variety of meats, vegetables & entrees such as samosas , spring rolls & sushis . There is also desserts , i had some mango ice cream , it was great ! However i felt like their wasnt enough variety, your typical beef, pork or chicken , some vegetables & a select few entrees...but i was told it was for the lunch menu & that for dinner, it was much more complete with things like sea food & many other vegetables addded. 
All in all the food had great taste & it was fun to grill it yourself while chatting up with a friend, the meats cooked pretty quickly , and i like mine very well cooked not bloody at all.

So i'm defnitely curious to go back for Dinner. Oh also, i went there with a friend but i think it would be much more fun as a group ! 

Only down side was that i felt a little rushed by the waiters & they seemed pretty hyper & in a hurry. But i later found out that it was because the restaurant closes from 3 to 5 i think, to switch from lunch to dinner time. Still it made the experience less enjoyable

438 My favorite place to go on a friday or saturday after a few (many) drinks. Who can say no to 14.99$ all you can eat korean bbq. At this time choices are limited, but the beef is delicious and so are the fries. What more can I ask for!?

I have been there for a regular lunch hour. The advantage of that is that on top of the delicious meet selection I can also get some sushi. The service is fast and they are really friendly. Only thing is... sometimes the grill doesnt get hot enough and you cant cook quite as fast as youd like. 

I will keep comming here when I get that late night craving... better than poutine hands down

439 I thought there was a good range of choice on the menu. The beef and chicken were good and the prawns too. The lamb didn't look that great and he calamari looked really weird and I didn't want to eat it. Our waitress was very friendly and the service was quick. Overall I thought it was pretty good and a fun way to spend an evening with friends. 

The only downside was the queue in the doorway. They need a sign saying you can go in if you have a reservation. And they will only sit you when half your group has arrived which is annoying if you've booked.

440 This is one of those restaurants that at peak times have lines of people waiting to get in for a nice filling meal.

I went there for lunch since that is usually my heaviest meal of the day, and I don't like to have a buffet at night, so close to sleep time. 

I got seated promptly and decided to order several standard items on the menu.   Here's my review..

Short ribs - Delicious, nicely seasoned, good size
Spicy sausage- A winner !!   LOL...
Fish fillet - nice and thick, lean pieces of meat, delicious
Chicken teriyaki - OK, not great
Short rib noodle - Too salty for my taste, not a return item for me
Fried scallops - crispy, delicious, nicely done
Spicy Escolar roll was OK, not the best sushi, but ok
Salmon Nigiri was again, OK, not the greatest
Short Rib fried rice was OK, I rather have the short rib meat and the steamed rice separate.
Mango ice cream, did not agree with my lactose intolerant stomach LOL..

Overall a nice buffet, if you find what you really like and keep eating it.   Prices are higher Friday - Saturday - Sunday.  

The staff is hurried and not very smiley nor responsive, but I have read about that before, so I was not surprised.

441 I could've given a 5 starts but the customer service was horrible. I was trying to be nice and even tried to make jokes to lighten up the mood, but he didn't want nothing from that. I understand that we need to pay 15% but the way our waiter spoke to us was disrespectful. Our waiter yesterday night was not listening to us and took really long to bring our ice cream at the end of the night. 
There are ways to explain the rules of the restaurant to customers in a respectful way. I really didn't want to give the tip but we had no choice apparently.

443 The experience is fun, I love Korean BBQs and grilling my own food on the table. This particular Korean BBQ isn't the best, the service is very basic, and the wait time can get ridiculous without a reservation. The food though is served very quickly. If you've been to different Korean BBQs before you will find that this one isn't the best but I like that we can eat outside during the summer.

444 Great place for a birthday dinner or a romantic date. If you have kids I wouldn't go there as it's more an adult place. 

The fish is very fresh and all the sides are great. Although it's not a japanese place, their sushi are pretty good.

The staff is a bit rude but I didn't really pay attention to it as you just tell them what you want and they go away and come back with it without really saying anything. Took them a while to fill up our water glasses.

Would go again anytime.

Service: Ok, had to ask a few times to make sure we had our order. Waitress was really nice. 

Food: good, comparing to amazing in San Francisco. We were six guests... we had about everything on the menu. I recommended the Kimchi & the Edamame. All the meats were well marinated.

I would recommend this place only if you are a fan of Korean BBQ

447 After reading some bad critics, I wasn't expecting much. But I was still very disappointed.

Cons:
- Service is bad. They are not polite, just throw the food on your table, not a single nice word.
- Atmosphere is bad. Only kids and young adults around 20 there. It feels like a high school canteen. 
- Food is terrible. Everything has a taste of burnt plastic. Probably the oil they use on the grill? Rests of soap? I can't even tell. The food itself is almost not seasoned so this plastic taste isn't even hidden by anything. 
- Price. 36$ for 1 coke and all-I-could-eat. Super expensive for the overall quality of the restaurant.

Pros: 
- It's fun to cook your meat yourself. For 5 minutes. Then it's just getting annoying.

tldr; never going back there. Even if it was free.

450 This is the type of place you go to with people who you're comfortable enough to stuff your face with. Because I don't care how much willpower you think you have, once that menu is set on the table, Pandora's box is opening, and it's full of Korean BBQ. 

Now it's not the best Korean BBQ spot ever, but it's certainly not the worst. You get what you pay for, and you'll leave satisfied. That's really all there is to it. That said, I could eat their deep fried scallops by the cupful (not recommended).

451 This is one of my fav Korean bbq place..Mmm all you can eat :) I'm happy.  Weekend tends to be really busy now and long wait.  You can call for reservations now I believe.  They finally have soju after asking 50mil times.  Customer service is great.  They change the grill when i ask them.  One time they accidentally spilled on me but they made it up with a bottle of soju..I'm happy to drink..sure! Thanks will come again :) Yes, you have to cook/grill your own food otherwise learn or don't come. It's a good experience.

452 Great Korean barbecue and good sushi. Come early it fills up quickly.
This is an all you can eat. You order dishes and cook them on the grill in the middle of the table. They also serve sushi though this is not the principle attraction. If you want just sushi you will be better served elsewhere. Ambiance is good, though loud.
Enjoy, I have several times.

453 This was my first time going to a Korean barbecue, and I must say that I had a good experience.  I was expecting service to be mediocre and the place to smell of barbecue, but it wasn't.  It was surprisingly better than I had anticipated.  

The way it works is that you just look at the menu, choose what you wanted, and check it off on a list.  You then give your list to your server and s/he will bring you the raw ingredients.  You have to cook it yourself, but that's part of what makes the experience interesting. 

My favorites were the sliced ribs and the calamari.  The calamari was surprisingly very tender, and the beef was well marinated.  Definitely a must try! Cheers!

454 TL:DR - Basically 30 bucks for good Korean BBQ and Sushi Buffet

I've been to an AYCE Korean BBQ place.  I've been to an AYCE sushi place.  But I've never been to an AYCE Korean BBQ and Sushi place.  Unfortunately for me, I wasn't prepared to come otherwise I would've worn some looser fitting clothes.   We wanted to go to a place down the street but our group was too big for them to accommodate.  So we naturally followed the crowd and saw the line at Seoul Chako and decided to eat here instead.  Luckily for us, the place is big and was able to take our group after a short wait.

This place is perfect for a bunch of meat hungry guys.  Hmm, that did't sound right.  Nevertheless, you pick from menu with well over a dozen different kinds of meat and seafood.
Each order comes in a small bowl with a small portion for you to cook yourself on a grill that's built into your table.  There's no limit on the amount that you can order so as long you eat it all other wise you'll be charged extra.  All the meats I tried were good, tender, and well marinated.  Everything on the sushi menu, although limited, was good and above average for a buffet.  

My only gripe was our server.  He was slow with our drinks and food and some of requests were met with a eye roll.  Not sure if he hates his job or was just repulsed by the amount of food that us Americans were throwing down but he did not look like he wanted to be there.  

Regardless, this is one of MANY restaurants along St. Catherine but should be up among the places you should try especially if you're trying to accommodate a big group.

456 I was actually expecting the worst from my first impressions but by the end it wasn't that bad. I would have given it a 3.5 star. Girl at the front needs to learn how to smile. Zero character!!! Tables were dirty and had to ask them to clean it. But the food was half decent. Nothing to what I am used to when I am in Hong Kong where I normally have my Korean BBQ fix. Would I go back?? Maybe but I always do in HK!!

457 Ok well first of all we made a reservation for 20 and we were there on time (the manager tried to pin this one on me) and guess what .. They didn't have any tables set up for us. I MEAN COME'ON . Why did I even take the time to make a reservation 2 weeks in advance. This business is crap seriously do not go there. Go somewhere else. You pay for the food and the service just remember that.
I never complain about anything in life, but I must admit I was really upset about this because the manager was trying to blame me for I don't know what reason.. I guess for making a reservation at their restaurant. 
Never again

458 They just opened a new location on St Catherine across Odaki. I recommend not getting shrimp or chicken wings as the shrimp was very messy to grill then peel off the skin. The chicken had no seasoning so it was dry. The beef ribs and the beef flank were very tasty. The beef brochettes are also a good choice. The calamari is hard to cook because you may overcook it. The price and the amounted food you could order was worth it. I would come again

459 I've been passing by this restaurant for years and finely gave in and went with my
Friend.

At first we were seated on the side leading to the kitchen it looked dirty so we asked to be moved to better seat.

24.99 unlimited food sounds like the real deal and it is just depending on what you like. Personally the cooking part is cool but it does take work. The best meat was beef rib most flavour and best quality. Shrimp I found bland and no flavour, same
For the chicken and beef slices. I asked for some sort of sauce all they had was spicy stuff untill one of my orders came the fried dumplings. The plum sauce is what I was dipping most my food in because lack of taste.

It was a great experience but I don't think the food was that great. But a pitcher of Sapporo 16 bucks can't go wrong with that.

460 I went back yesterday to eat again with a big group and the food is still great but the service was incredibly bad.. After we wrote the order the waiter came and sarcastically said do not worry we are open until 10 pm, meaning we order too much. Then again while a small kid was eating her fries he took her plate away and she cried because still was fries in here palate. That was very impolite and out right rude, the irony was that we mandatory had to pay the tips I do not think that was faire.

461 I decided to come by here at random, the restaurant is eye catching so I walked in. I did have quite the appetite and it was filling as it is all you can eat. 

However, the service is very slow, be prepared to wave your hand to catch the waiters attention. The food was average, the meats were barely marinated, sushi was decent. The fried tempuras were good, can't really mess that up. The service is what is hurting the restaurant. If you're reading this, please step it up to increase and keep your business.

This place is quantity over quality, which I do prefer at times but this place isn't worth trying.

470 Where to start! This is definitely a restaurant I have been to several times over the course of 2-3 years. And I can tell you that not once have I walked away from this restaurant feeling down or unsatisfied. 

The customer service is simple. Because it's the customers who are cooking the food (besides sushi and anything fried), it's not a surprise that the customer service isn't as individualized. The staff is expected to just bring the ingredients, fill your water glasses, and take away the empty plates. And what's great is that if you order too many plates, they will warn you of the consequences and see to it that you take only a third or half of those plates. Besides, it's not over if you finish everything and still want more. You're always welcome to send in a new order slip to them. Just leave it on the table and they'll come pick it up. If the metal grill, on which you cook the meat, seafood, and veggies, gets soiled, a waiter will come around to change it. And you don't even have to ask them to sometimes. Same with the refilling of water. I am aware that some reviewers have had problems with reservations, but when it comes to the actual service of food, there are few to no complaints. 

Now onto the exciting part: the meat. For carnivores like me, this is perhaps a restaurant that will have your heart's desires in mind. They serve very juicy and tender meat, that is, if you cook it well enough. They serve a large variety of meat, and you may be able to try all that they offer if you go at dinner time. My favourites are the spare ribs and ox tongue. The chewiness of the latter appeals to me. And spare ribs are very commonly used in Korean BBQ. The only meat I would refrain from is the chicken. It tends to come out very dry and nearly flavourless. Shame, for chicken is one type of food I crave most days. 

All the vegetables come out fresh and can be eaten uncooked, but I would highly recommend cooking the mushrooms at least. In fact, I love the mushrooms so much I order at least 3 plates of them. Anyway, at any restaurant offering Korean BBQ, mushrooms are a popular accompaniment. And of course, if you're not too keen on the veggies, there are soups and salads along with non-BBQ dishes, like dumplings and sushi, to choose from. Heck, they even have french fries and popcorn chicken. Yes, you heard me right. French fries. 

After all's been said and eaten, you can never go wrong with unlimited ice cream. As I always tell my friends when I go to an all-you-can-eat place, I have a second stomach for ice cream. In my most recent visit, I had 4 bowls of ice cream. Each bowl equals one scoop by the way, so I fortunately did not get brain freeze. 

Just be careful of what time you go at and how much they charge you. If you come near the end of the lunch period, you will have to pay the dinner fee, which is higher of course. But at least you'll be offered a larger variety of food. 
And sometimes if you come in large groups, your receipt may indicate a slightly different total price from the other receipts, even in the case when everyone has ordered the same things and nothing requiring extra charges.

474 Seoul Chako claims to serve korean BBQ but everything is extremely westernized and generic. They are the perfect example of a place that boosts quantity/variety over quality and even though nothing tastes bad, do you really want to spend money on something that's just meh? Prices are not cheap either (expect around $30 night time and even more on weekends). 

The restaurant is quite large and can accommodate large group of people.

475 I've been to authentic Korean BBQ restaurants in Vancouver and this one was nothing like it. The meat is nothing special and service was okay. I liked the food but for the price I did not have what I expected to have. They also have no Korean drinks and the offer ending at 10:30pm and the other one starting at 11pm is not clear and not client friendly. You will enjoy the sushi and having to cook your meat but not worth your money in my opinion.

477 Went here with family and the food tasted good but it wasn't anything special. First experience at a Korean BBQ restaurant and honestly, I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon. Not because it was all bad, just because I wasn't impressed. 

The staff was polite and nice, but water never got refilled (they only refilled out water after at least an hour of us being there). MANY of our orders were neglected and never came, so we had to reorder a second time only because we were missing most of our items. Price seemed fair considering it's an all-you-can-eat. 

My biggest issue was cleanliness. The table was not cleaned, or not very well at least. As we walked to our table we passed by the bar and lounge area that was a complete mess, with boxes and glass racks stacked against the wall everywhere, which is unexpected from this type of space and restaurant. Many of the food pieces would stay stuck on the grill as it was not non-stick. 

Overall I made the best of the experience, but unless your tastes aren't particularly perfect, I wouldn't recommend this place

479 Not sure why the lack of love for this place but I'm glad I followed my friend's recommendation for this place. A HUGE hit with the whole family for a very reasonable price.

Yes, its an AYCE Korean BBQ, but with lots to choose from. We really enjoyed the salmon, the beef, and definitely the pork belly.  Even the picky eaters in the group ate everything. Add to that the dumplings and the sides you can get, and this place was a big winner.  

Loved cooking it ourselves and we walked right in on a Wednesday evening without a reservation. Service was prompt and efficient.

The right food for the right price! Yum!!!

Is an all you can eat place where you can order Korean style barbecue. You have the opportunity the try out the array of meats, veggies and cuisine that is being offered in the establishment. It has a party style atmosphere with dim lighting...

482 In all honesty, this place isn't good. The quality of the meat is just super poor (not to mention how the marinade of the meat is also extremely salty). I feel like I have to drink two gallons of water after exiting this resto. I understand it's an all-you-can-eat concept, however, the price does not justify poorly made food.

In terms of the service, the waiters get their tasks done. However, it could get slow at times. And they have a tendency to ignore you??? Like???

It's a decent place for a big crowd, however, do not expect much from it.

Also, a small PSA: be prepared to smell like a grill after you exit this place.

484 Great selection, great concept! For a fixed price you can order as much and as frequently as you want. Portions are small, which is ok since you can re-order as often as desired. This minimizes waste when serving those whose eyes are bigger than their stomachs! Meat is brought raw for you to cook at your table.  Ingredients are fresh. Service was good and servers were attentive. Would definitely return.

485 Very overrated and overpriced

This is not korean food guys. A lot of thing are missing for it to be a korean retaurent. It is basically a grill your meat and veggies. And it is overpriced for the meal you eat. They dont even use the same type of meat korean bbq use.(where is the samgyupsal abd the chadolbaeki?_aka the basics).... but at least they use fresh ingredients (sometimes). The owner is chinese so theres a lot of chinese influences that i spotted.. like the dressings and sauces and marinades do not taste korean (salty and spicy) but sweet and sour like chinese food. Or maybe americanized korean food? Idk ... i hope this is not what non korean people think this is korean food.

486 What a great experience!  We went in for the Korean BBQ, and were very impressed by the size of the plates that were offered. Two big hungry guys were stuffed after two rounds and barely had room for dessert. I am looking forward to going back!

487 All you can eat? Korean BBQ? I'm sold.

This place is almost too good to be true. The wait staff was amazingly friendly and quick. 
We had several orders of the beef and beef ribs. Both were absolutely delicious...and we loved cooking it ourselves. We prefer the beef ribs slightly charred like my boyfriends mom makes at home. 
We also had the pickled veggies and dumpling. I absolutely loved the pickled daikon, cucumbers and carrots. The dumplings were deep fried, and while they were quite good, I think I prefer pan fried dumplings (potstickers or gyoza). 
Also, the lychee martini was amazing, and if it hadn't been so hot out, I'd probably have had a few more. They were some of the cheapest cocktails around. (I think 5.75 cad or something).
The only hiccup was the internet was down so they couldn't take cards or print a bill, but they did have an ATM so we were able to grab cash out right on the spot.

This place made our trip from BTV to Montreal worth it. I would drive back just to have dinner here.

488 We just went there on a Saturday afternoon without any expectations but just to try something new. We were not disappointed actually. We enjoyed the experience more than the food. Each table is equipped with a BBQ grill where you grill your food yourself. The service is pretty slow hence you it's better to order in advance. Out of all chicken theriyala was my favorite.

490 Great place to go if you're a group. There's a communal aspect to the eating experience as you share a grill with your friends. We went for a friend's birthday party: the staff was very pleasant and offered to cut and plate the cake. 
I'm not a big meat eater, but their beef cuts were to die for. If you're not a big fan of beef, you have a variety of other choices: white fish, shrimp, chicken, lamb (on Friday and weekends), squid, and so on. Vegetables and tofu are available for vegetarians, but this is definitely not a place where meat-abstinence is celebrated. Everything comes compartmentalized in cute black stackable bowls that are easy to pass around for everyone to dig in. 
Other choices include fried scallops, which looked somewhat cheap with a dot of plain mayo on each piece. Fried calamari reminds you that this is an all-you-can eat.
The mango ice cream tasted gritty, the flavour somewhat reminded me of penicillin. Green tea ice cream was okay.

491 Went for my birthday, again lol

They opened recently, it's an all you can eat korean bbq place. The service is a bit dodgy so expect to wait a bit so don't go if you're in a rush.

When we were there they had some problems with the ventilation, so expect to smell when you leave.

The place looks nice, the tables all have a gas fire pit in the middle, so you can cook your food right at the table, it's closer to the way we see it in other major cities.

Montreal is a bit behind the trend concerning korean food, compared to TO, Vancouver and NYC...  but this place will bring us closer.

Like all Korean bbq places in mtl you get a few side dishes, always kim chi, bean sprouts, stewed potatoes and some sea weed, daicon pickles, fried tofu... that's about 6 sides which is more than usual, i think the average is about 3 usually in mtl, so on that point, that's good.

of the sides, the potatoes are quite good, the rest are just average. There are over 20 sides that I've come to know, so we are far behind. I once was served 14 sides in NYC, just the sides alone filled me up that time...

On to the food, you basically order by the type of meat you want. On this point there is quite a bit to choose from, you have chicken, lamb, beef, beef short rib, pork, shrimp (with head and peel), fish, squid, sausage, veggies. nb: bbq shrimp should be had with head and peel, the flavor is deeper and the shrimp stays moist once cooked. You should at least suck on the head if you don't want to eat it. I eat the whole thing from head to tail, and I like it, it's a bit of an acquired taste, but if you peel the shrimp it will taste quite unsatisfying since it will taste bland like boiled shrimp...

The meat comes in small portions, usually 2-3 pieces. Which is good since you can order a wide variety and reorder what you like after... We tried the beef, beef short rib, squid, shrimp, fish, sausage and some veggies. I strongly recommend the short rib!!! I was quite impressed with it, it was fresh and the cut is quite thick, I'd say about half an inch thick cooked. it was tender and juicy. very nice, i've never had it quite so thick but I like it. (update feb 2012, the thickness is less but still thicker than other places)

We didn't try any chicken or pork because my friend wasn't so keen on it, but i wish we had, I want to try it!!! you can also order rice with your order if you want.

The menu also offers, some starters like miso soup and salads and edamame, and a variety of sushi rolls.

The starters are nice, nothing impressive but they do enhance the experience. The sushi is standard also, however the fish is quite fresh. I'm really impressed with the freshness of the meats and fish in this place, considering it's 21.99 $ per person all you can eat!!! (23.99 friday to sunday)

My one problem is they don't bring out the dipping sauce with the meat, we had to ask them for it. When we got the sauce, it turned out to be gochuchang, which is Korean hot paste. Traditionally, they eat korean bbq with bean paste, this I find strange that they offer gochuchang, but in any case I always eat my bbq with gochuchang so I'm not complaining :)

Also usually proper Korean bbq is accompanied with raw garlic and sliced jalapenos and scallions for you to grill, all 3 are absent here, sadly I didn't bother to ask so no idea if they even have it on demand... Another standard item missing here is lettuce, peculiarly enough, lettuce is available to order for an additional 1.50$ what the? really, you are gonna milk me for lettuce?

The traditional way to eat korean bbq is to wrap it in the lettuce, inside you put the meat, garlic, scallions and whatever other sides you wish to put in like pickled radish and kim chi. So on this point, no this is not a comprehensive Korean bbq service, but then again, none of the places in mtl are... but taste wise it is good, and I like it. 

as a side note, I really wish we get a real Korean bbq joint where they use wood charcoal in the pit instead of gas. You get much better heat distribution and a nicer char on the meat, plus the bbq flavor really comes out. so if you happen to find a place like that anywhere you should try it :)

we ended with some ice cream, nothing special but nice to have something to cleanse your palate with, it's not persimmon tea but hey let's not ask for too much at once...
So on the strength of the meat quality, the price/quality ratio, side dish variety and advancing the Korean bbq scene in mtl, I give it 4 stars (compared to other mtl bbq places) even though my korean friends would curse me lol. I will definitely go back.

492 The only reason why I'm giving Seoul Chako 3 stars is because their late-night AYCE deal gets you a lot of food for what you pay. The quality of the meat (especially the chicken) is subpar, but it will definitely leave you full if you come on an empty stomach. There is also quite a variety of fried small plates (we got the fried scallops, potstickers, potato croquettes, and spring rolls), which is really odd for a KBBQ place, but you can't really expect much from restaurant that doesn't have Korean ownership (hint, it's Chinese-owned). Normally, I wouldn't go here or even eat Korean barbecue in Montr챕al since it's pretty abysmal, but it's good if you're in a group, have the late-night munchies, and want unlimited ice cream to go along with it, I guess.

493 Great place in a neighborhood full of good ethnic food.  I got a table right next to St. Catherine so I could watch the parade of oddballs ambling about, and got the BBQ setup on my table.  Took a while to figure out how to avoid cooking too fast or slow, but eventually I became a BBQ master - the key is to keep the flame just going so you can cook at the same pace you eat.  Awesome.  Service was quick as well.

494 The food is too salty and the service is terrible! Especially they directly add 15% tips without any explanation( as what I know we don't have to pay 15% if we are not over or equal 6 ) we were preparing to give tips but the waiter was rude. He dropped the plates so heavy. When we were eating they always come and ask do u finish. I guess because there were a line in front of the door.  Worst service and worst buffet! Never back!

497 The selection isn't the best I've had in terms of Korean BBQ, however, what you do get tastes quite good! I ordered plenty of shrimp, fish, beef and chicken. The vegetables I ordered weren't the freshest so they came out quite dry, apart from that, the menu doesn't deliver numerous options like other (better) Korean BBQ places do (especially my favorite one on Monkland). Nonetheless, if you're in the downtown area and in the mood for a 30$ all you can eat Korean BBQ, give it a taste! Maybe you'll like it, maybe it'll be average.

499 I went to this place several times and was never disappointed. The marinate on the meat is good and there is a decent variety of items to choose from. I would recommend the beef and pork as they are the one that cook the fastest. Overall I think the ratings are too harsh on the all you can eat korean barbecue as I felt like the food and the service were decent. Fair prices, a good choice if you want a huge amount of meat.

501 Although I love the concept, I was not thrilled with the food here. The best thing I would say is the chicken. It has a nice flavour to it. Other than that, I feel the food is quite bland. With no sauce or spice on the other meat, seafood and veggies, grilling just doesn't do enough. The pieces of salmon seemed fresh but when cooked just felt boring due to the fact they they were just simple raw pieces of salmon with no taste. I feel this place should offer sides of spices and special sauces to help compliment their meat. For me anyways, this would give a huge boost.

502 My first Korean bbq restaurant I've ever been to! They had something for each of my picky friends - which is always a bonus! The menu is huge and has many great options to choose from. Everything we ordered tasted delicious. However the service was awful. We had to flag down our waiter each time we wanted to place a new ticket, and even had to remind her for a water refill. The food came out all in various waves. Sometimes items we ordered would never reach our table and items we definitely didn't order would come out. This place deserves 5/5 stars, but I sadly, can't give it close because of the service. Still a definite must try while in Montreal! $27 dollars for all you can eat ...so go hungry!!

503 The food is good but the service is TERRIBLE. It is slow and the server completely ignored our table to take our papers with our orders. The restaurant wasn't even full. Moreover, they are like throwing the plates on the table without even mentioning the fact them bringing wrong orders. Never gonna go back there. There are other better korean bbq  than this place like kalbi, yoko or sota bbq

504 This place do have great food! The short ribs are great. I would admit that when you do order they all come out in really small portions. So if you do go then double the order, because their costumer service sucks! After our first order they never came back to check on us. It wasn't even busy! I understand if it was, but they didn't have much customers and none of them smile! We had to flag them down every time we wanted something. Also, when we wanted to order more stuff they didn't come out with all our orders. We were missing a few! Other than that the food IS good and the ice cream as well. If you do go to this place, make sure to double the order!

506 Extremely unimpressed with this.

The concept is great, really. Cooking your own food makes it fun and cuts costs for the restaurant, allowing the prices to be cheaper (in theory). However you would expect the quality of the food you are being served to be far better than what you actually get here. Korean BBQ is wayyyyy better than this. This place was hyped up to me by a couple of friends (whose opinions I will take very lightly in the future). Unfortunately, everything is too salty and lacking actual taste and flavor.

The sushi, likewise, was a major disappointment as well. I did not expect great sushi (it is a Korean restaurant after all) but it was far beyond sub-par. The makis were rolled very loosely, so everything would break about before you could stick the piece in your mouth. The only semi-acceptable roll were the plain avocado... but even then, the avocado tasted old and the seaweed had an odd flavor. Was it stale? We may never know.

The vegetables were probably the best part of the meal. You are better off going to Le Petit Tobeki (formerly known as 5000 ans) on Monkland... but even that has declined in quality.

If anyone knows a great Korean BBQ place, please enlighten me!

508 Love this place. For $14.99, all you can eat Korean BbQ is a huge deal. I love the short ribs the most, so tender and tasty. I don't know if it's true but on the menu it stated that you would be charged $1 for each piece left-over. The all you can eat menu includes sushi and ice cream as well. Definitely will come back when i visit Montreal again

509 I heard the hype about these Korean BBQ joints, so o checked one out tonight, and I wasn't impressed at all. All of there meats were barely seasoned, there vegetables have nothing on them at all, no salt or pepper. The chicken and salmon kept getting stuck to the grill, like wouldn't u think it would be a non stick grill, that fire is way to hot...and the service, wow.. Yeah they were fast but they kept forgetting things. 

I enjoyed there short ribs cause they seem to be the only thing that were seasoned. I can't get over the veggies, no seasoning or anything. I asked for a dipping sauce for the chicken and the waiter came with salt.  I guess there was a lack of communication on my part... Right.

The only thing really good about this spot is its open really late on Friday and Saturdays. I really wanted to enjoy my first Korean BBQ experience but left there wondering why we paid over 30$ for tasteless food.

510 The worst restaurant in Montreal !! The hostess told us 30 min wait and  it end it up 1:30 hour of waiting. After 15 min on our table the waitress said we only have 10 min to give our last order! She pressured us to pay before we finished eating.
we received the meat at first and the appetizer at last!
The food was tasteless. We had to tell the waitress 4 times to bring a knife and to refill the water.

We came here for dinner a few weeks ago for AYCE Korean BBQ. We got here around 8pm and waited about 15 minutes for a table. The place was pretty busy and there were many groups of people dining. 

We ordered the following:
1) Appetizers: Miso soup, green salad, and kimchi. I recommend all of these appetizers. The serving size is small. We ordered kimchi three times since it was pretty good.
2) Meats: Sliced beef and short ribs. I preferred the sliced beef over the short ribs. Overall, both meats were good.
3) Seafood: Clams, fish fillet, and salmon. The fishes were a bit hard to cook since it would get stuck to the grill. I really like the clams and there are four small clams per order.
4) Vegetables: Onions and oyster mushrooms
5) A bowl of rice for each of us

We didn't order the ramen, fried rice, or sushi rolls since these items would probably make us full quicker. We mainly focused on getting the meat and seafood. We thought the food was pretty decent for the price ($24.99 CAD for Wednesday night, about ~$20 USD per person).

Service was a bit spotty for us. They missed some of appetizer orders in the beginning. It took awhile for the staff to clear out the empty plates from our table. Although, our waiter was very quick to change the grill top when we requested it. Overall, the food and dining experience wasn't that bad for us.

514 Amazing place to eat with a group of friends if you're hungry! All you can eat Korean BBQ and sushi! The meats are very delicious and juicy, and the sushi is average, but all you can eat? Who's to complain. I would not recommend if you're craving good sushi. Lastly, the mango and strawberry ice are the BOMB. For the price of about 26$ it's a very fair deal.

One thing that threw me off is the service and cleanliness. Firstly, they are very slow at bringing things like extra mayonnaise, or refills on water. Secondly, the waiter straight up told that he had a very high fever for the past few days, after he was handling all the food and drinks that we ate (luckily we didn't get sick..). Lastly, the counters and grills were all dirty..

Overall, the idea and restaurant itself is amazing. However management needs to clean up and get their S*** together.

517 J'adore les BBQ cor챕ens et depuis quelques temps, j'aper챌ois pleins de petits bouis-bouis qui fleurissent au centre-ville. Tant mieux, voil횪 une belle addition culinaire dans le circuit gourmand montr챕alais.

J'ai essay챕 ce buffet un mercredi midi, avec des amis. Le resto est assez r챕cent. L'ambiance 챕tait calme, peu de clients (il faut dire qu'il a fait 26 degr챕s 횪 l'ext챕rieur...), donc on pouvait bavarder en paix. La d챕coration est sobre. 

Le buffet est un prix fixe (la semaine le midi, c'챕tait 13,99 $ moins 10% de rabais du lundi au jeudi). Il y a un menu et on commande ce que l'on veut manger 횪 la serveuse. 

Le service 챕tait un peu mal organis챕 au d챕but, ce n'챕tait pas clair 횪 qui il fallait commander, car plusieurs employ챕s arrivaient avec les diff챕rents plats. Bon, pour nous, ce n'챕tait pas tr챔s grave, car on avait le temps. Mais je conseille de vous armer d'un peu de patience et de temps disponible si vous mangez l횪!


Petit b챕mol: primo, la laitue iceberg est 1,50$ en extra (pourquoi???) et les boissons (y compris le th챕 vert) ne sont pas incluses dans le prix du buffet. Secondo, il n'y a pas de shoju, un alcool pourtant typiquement cor챕en (????)

Petit plus: le prix qui est doux pour le porte-feuille et le fait que c'est un buffet 횪 volont챕. Parfait pour vos carnivores affam챕s pr챕f챕r챕s!

Est-ce que j'y retournerai? Probablement pas, car il y a tellement de restos dans ce coin-l횪 et que j'aimerais essayer. J'ai mang챕 dans de meilleurs restos cor챕ens ailleurs.

520 I went to Seoul Chako yesterday with my girlfriend during lunch hour. Normally 13.99, we had student discounts that reduced the price to 10 dollars. 

There were very few people in the restaurant while we were there, I'd say 3-4 other patrons at the most (keep in mind this is a hot Thursday noon).  

AMBIANCE:
Top-notch. This is a very new restaurant, and the interior design and amnesties show that. Each table has their own grill, and it's a very high-tech one at that. They have their own inbuilt ventilation system that takes away the messiness and teary eyes usually associated with grilling your own food. 

SERVICE:
Quick and professional, though i wasn't particularly used to the way we ordered the food. Unlike similar asian buffet restaurants such as Tokyo/Kanda/Crescent sushi,  you don't write your order down on a piece of paper; instead the waiter comes around every so often to take your order. As a result we had to order food 3 times, a needless stress really. 

FOOD:
Here is where Seoul Chako falls a bit short. In one word, food is SALTY. Everything from the meat, to the soups, to the sushi. I had to down 2 glasses of water during the meal. Beef is definitely the highlight on the menu, it is tender and tasty. Short ribs were hard to cook, and overly fatty. The chicken and octopus were way too salty for my liking. 

Sushi is also served here, though they aren't as good as Tokyo Sushi across the street. 

All in all, I would highly recommend this to any students who can get their hands on coupons (and man are they plentiful). Worth it for 10 bucks, not sure whether or not the normal priced lunch/dinner would be as good as a deal.

524 I've tried many different Korean BBQS. This one is probably in the less good range. Its not bad exactly but its abit bland. The marinade for the meats was all pretty similar. The quality of the meat was good though. The sushi was pretty good. The one thing that stood out form the other Korean BBQS are the takoyakis. I've never seen them in another AYCE place. That was a nice surprise although they but ketchup on them which was really weird. Appart from that the service was acceptable and relatively quick.
Honestly Sota right across the street is much better.

but the only thing i didn't like is that the staff didn't tell us anything at all. like about the fact that we have to write our order on a piece of paper, or how to cook the meat correctly. they also didn't check if we needed something. i had to wait 10 min to ask a waiter for a fork and he took too much time to bring one. i understand that it was busy but the staff need to be more welcoming and more helpfull.
PS: i also made a mistake i didn't check before and went at 2:30 so we had 30 min left to order everything we want because lunch time finishes at 3.

531 This is my favorite Korean grill in Montreal. Mmmmm.. We come here at least twice a month if not more. 

So, let's break it down.

It's an all-you-can-eat BBQ

You cook your own food

You can pick between a bunch of different meats and seafood

But, it doesn't stop there!

There's sushi....there are salads....there's edemame....there are raw veggies.....there are fries....and there's ice cream! How can you go wrong?!

The waiters are always happy

The food is super duper fresh

And did I mention that it's an all-you-can-eat BBQ????

In all seriousness though, the food really is quite good here.. Well marinated and well cut. The only thing I'm really not a fan of here is the chicken.. But that's just because of the marinade. Other than that, my mouth is totally watering and I wish it wasn't close to midnight so I could run over there and devour everything on that menu right now!

Go check it out, and please don't go if you have to be somewhere important after. Why?? Because you will stink like BBQ.......for a very long time!

532 We are a big fan of Seoul Chako, and love the concept. First time, the service was a tad on the low side as it took a while for the waiters to come pick up our order, and we would see them talking and crossing their arms. But the second, service was much better!

The food is amazing, especially the beef which is seasoned perfectly. The chicken is tasty also. I ordered the Dragon Eye sushi roll and it was delicious, just like the ons at Sushi Crescent. 

Overall, nice and cozy place, and amazing concept! Would recommend!

533 the idea of korean BBQ is good but I think it's overpriced, the menu is not diverse enough, (not for the price we are paying 40$ for a friday night), the two time I went there my stomach felt weird afterward, i wasnt sure if it was me who didnt cook the food well or because something is weird with their food or the cooking surface which seems not so clean. We asked the waitress to change it and she had such a bad attitude...anyways not really recommending this place

536 For the price, what you're getting is really great. All you can eat decent sushi and meats. The cooking plates are pretty good, and I really like their beef. The sweet potato roll is also very good.

Come on friday thru Sunday for the desert bar. However ice cream is always served through the week.

My one problem here is that the servers are very slow to respond sometimes. You write your orders down on a piece of paper, very standard, but they hardly come around to pick it up. I always have to waive a guy down.

537 I went 3 times, 1st time was good, the grill n everything awsm. 2nd n 3rd times weren't. ...friendly. waiters were unpleasant. They don't smile, not attentive. Don't like to have any conversation. Orders took long to serve. I don't enjoy food if it's not served with care n love. I complined, it seems to be a normal thing for them. 

Wat I didn't like about the place : not spacious, not well ventilated , not many tables with windos.suffocating, narrow between tables, so noisy. Expensive. Not Cleane. 

I love the grill do it ur selves. Many items to choose from . 
I will not go back ,didn't feel welcomed,wish the staffs were more friendly, little bit more spacious ,if were not too noisy,well ventilated,

538 I thought I was going to a club when I first saw the line-up, it was pretty big for a restaurant. Which is a good sign in my opinion. For the food I honestly would not recommend fish or chicken,they tend to get stuck on the pan and it's annoying. The best choice would be meat and sushi. The seasoning in their meat is great. The tip is already included in the bill which is weird and you have to pay for anything you couldn't eat so watch out for that. Other than that I would definitely recommend this place and I go occasionally.

539 The food was decent.

Our service was terrible. I say 'our' service because it's only fair to note that it really was one jackass, rude waiter who spoiled the meal for the entire group of us (20!).  The manager was nice and apologetic when I told her my opinion, and she said it was her fault - which is true, in a way - they should have had more staff available.  But she was nice enough.

Our waiter, hope you don't get him! Rude, short, threw food down, argued with us, cut us off, made the dinner and paying the check as difficult as possible. 

My review would have been one star if the manager hadn't been so apologetic and made me believe a lot of our experience was because of the server, not the establishment.

540 They pick up your food and not far from where is my table, just next to the entrance, there's a bin where the empty dishes go. The waiter throw the dishes instead of putting the dishes in the bin and that is so noisy for the ears. The noise seemed to be forever. The design of the table were nice and our waiter also.

546 NOT Korean BBQ. Real Korean BBQ has free side dishes and don't charge extra for kimchi and wraps. This place will never change the grill unless you ask them to, and they'll forget. A real kbbq joint will always know when change your grill. Great if you just wanna eat an enormous amount of eat, but don't call it kbbq. Also, it is run by Chinese people that own the Tokyo sushi across the street.

547 If you shove a bunch of starved people in a restaurant in the apocalyptic world, it would look like this place. 

Don't come here for the quality of food. Come here if you are close to dying of hunger and want to stuff your mouth with somewhat digestible food. 

Our orders were lost and we didn't get some of what we ordered. People who arrived after me got their orders first. The food items that we ordered the first around came an hour later. We didn't have meat until 30 minutes of waiting. This place is just chaos.

551 Worst organization ever
After waiting 1.5 hours , they stopped taking walkins and only reservations only so we waited an extra 45m (106 people ahead of us). They don't accept reservations under 6

After all this the food was okay at best.

552 This is NOT an authentic Korean place so if that's what your expectations are, you will be disappointed, like I was. We got beef and chicken which were cut too thick and the marinade tasted nothing close to Korean. Kimchi was... Gross. Additional charge for lettuce? Really? 'Korean' BBQ means thinly cut meat, scallion salad, and miso-gochujang paste (called samjang) wrapped in lettuce. Nice staff though!

If you wish to pay way too much for endless amount of bland, tasteless meat and meat only, I strongly recommend it!

Otherwise, you are much better off buying a jar of Bulbogi marinade from a Korean/Asian grocery store, buy some quality meat, veggies, and sweet potato noodles, and make it at home.

554 Went early this year with 2 other friends for the late night dinner. Called ahead but they refused to take reservation and hung up. We still ended up going and waiting in the cold outside for 15 minutes before getting a table. The servers only take tge first irder seriously and then forget about you. We had no idea so only ordered appetizers and drink first and had to wait 10 mins before anyone took our order list. The food was ok, no complains there. Ended up having a good time hence my rating but I havent been here since.

555 My friends and I went there a while ago because I was recommended by a relative but we were very poorly treated by the servers and staffs. Despite the place not being busy, the servers didn't attend us when needed and they were gattered at the front desk chatting while we were raising our hand for service. It took an eternity for them to bring us water and the server in charge of our table looked quite annoyed at us and would not take our order for the sole reason that it was written on two pieces of paper instead of one. I personally wasn't willing to pay 15% of tips for that kind of poor service (which was asked for with tables holding more than 6 people). In the end, we decided to go eat at the Korean barbecue restaurant facing Seoul Chako.

558 This is the WORST restaurant that I've ever been to.  Me and my fiend went there on a Sunday night. Three things happened that ruined our experience there:

1. My friend found a piece of plastic in her soup. She told our server about it, the server showed that soup to the manager. We didn't receive any apology or explanation from the manager. Then the server scooped another bowl of soup from the same pot instead of making her a new one.

2. We receive a plate of sushi with the order ticket on top of it. Then our server put his hand on our food to take away the order ticket.

3. We brought bubble tea to the place. They told us that we are not allowed to take our drink with us and took it away. But when we finished our dish and ask for our tea, he told us that someone closed the fridge door too hard so our tea was spilled. We didn't even have a chance to take a sip before he took it away. He apologized, pulled out his wallet and gave us cash for the tea. But my point here is not about the money. We would like to drink our tea instead of getting the reimbursement.

A restaurant that can not keep their food clean, cannot keep the customers stuff, does not deserve five stars. 

I give one star because the food is average and there is only one server that was patient and nice when I explained to him that I'm not a cheap tipper in general. The reason that I only gave 10% tip is that the service and the cleaning standard need to be improved. 

I've been to almost all if the restaurant in Montreal but this one is the worst. Don't waste your 40$ with tax and tips included in this place. Go to Miso or park to have some proper barbecue or sushi.

559 While visiting Montreal I decided to stop by here with a group of friends for a quick late night dinner. We were promptly seated but as soon as we ordered our food the experience went downhill. 

After 10 minutes we were served a single bowl of edamame, allthewhile the table beside us recieved everything they ordered.
Another 20 minutes passed and we received bits of our order - a tray or two of meat here and there - but nothing close to our original order. We then flagged our server down and asked what was taking the food so long. He told us to reorder, which we though was weird, but we did anyway.

We were still waiting on things as simple as miso soup and rice after hitting the 45 minute mark. Then our server brought us a large lump of rice on a single plate for all five of us to share. Never have I ever been to a Korean BBQ restaurant where one plate of rice was given for multiple people to share instead of given individual bowls.

After over an hour of waiting, reordering, and still not getting all of our food we asked to speak to a manager. The manager came over and insisted he would get us our missing items within 30 seconds - this was not the case. We had to wait an additional five minutes to receive our miso soup, which contained NO tofu whatsoever!

After all of this inconvenience we finally received everything we ordered. Overall the food tasted great, but the service was absolutely horrible and I will not be returning. I would not recommend coming here during late night hours. I do not normally leave Yelp reviews however I had to after having such a bad experience here.

561 My bf really wanted some Korean BBQ. I was a little skeptical about coming here and sad to say, it did not meet my expectations at all. I've definitely experienced better. 
To me the service wasn't the greatest. I understand that it can get pretty hectic when it is busy. But I've been to places that were just as busy or even busier. Our waiter did not even ask to see if this was our first time or to see if we knew how things worked. I've been to a Korean BBQ before but did not have to order by writing on a piece of paper. If I had not asked, we would have been sitting there for forever without anything. 
We both felt that the cleanliness wasn't the greatest. They could definitely improve on that. 
There was a lot of selections on the menu. Personally, the sushi was not good to me. Well the California roll was decent *shrugs*. The quality of meat was not the best to me. My bf thought the short rib was good, but I have had better. The pork belly was ok. I did like the spicy sausage and my bf liked the regular sausage. My bf and I were pleased with the ice cream though. Sooo it wasn't all bad. 
Sad to say that this was my bf's first time having Korean BBQ. Better luck next time!
I would not recommend this place. But with good company, why not?

562 Food was yummy but service was inconsistent and slow. They lost our original order and several things that were ordered never came. Used plates and cups piled up on the table. However it was a fun experience to cook and eat with family. Good atmosphere, fun for family, would return. Book ahead if you want a booth not a table.

564 + meat is very good quality. Sushi are good too. during weekend they have more options and also have a fridge of desserts variety (cake, pudding,etc). they offer a midnight menu. Good options for a Late night dinner at decent price.

- getting service and the attention of server to ask something takes forever. Takes a bit of time to reserve food. Server doesn't pass to refill water-you have to ask it takes a while to get it. You have to pay for soft drinks (other all you can eat I go usually doesn't make you pay soft drinks), wish there were a bit more sushi variety.

565 This has Nothing to do with Korean Food. Rather, Its a Chinese misinterpretation of what they think Korean food is. Please dont go here. They dont even have the basics of Korean Barbecue:

Uses Bacon for Samgyupsarl

Marinated Meat does not taste anything Korean

No Lettuce for wrapping

No Samjang - Most important sauce for Korean BBQ

No Garlic or kimchi for side grilling. Instead they have some weird grilled Onion options which Koreans never do.

No dish, I mean '0' dishes in the menu thats Korean at all. Instead they have sushi options. 

They dont change the grill when it gets filthy with soot until you are finished. Average Korean bbq places would at least change it 2-3 times for one meal sitting. 

They even had the oddity of having their signage in Chinese but no Korean even if its a 'Korean' restaurant. 


The list goes on please dont go here. Im only giving 2 stars not 1, because it was not absolutely horrible. Although the prices are expensive.

566 Not impressed. Name of restaurant does not live up to what they serve.I don't think it's even Korean bbq .They marinate the meat in some simple way, a bit tasteless actually,  that is not typically Korean I find. Korean bbq marinated meat.... It's usually a bit sweet and packs a lot more flavor. The fried dumplings were actually quite terrible, the filling was mushy inside and had a bad texture. And the kimchi, well...I'm no kimchi expert, but it didn't taste very appetizing. It was not sour enough for my liking. Service was inconsistent. I was served by 6 or 7 different people. Dinner cost was overpriced. $21.99 for all you can eat. Plus was, meat seemed fresh, came in nice small portions. Service was also generally pleasant. Atmosphere was close to high-end, the walls changed colors....reminded me a bit of a club, Anyway I would not pay 21.99$ for this kind of food. I'd prefer to pay the lunch price which is 13.99$.

567 Le concept est sympa mais seigneur que le service est inacceptable. Nous n'avions pas le temps de manger tranquillement, nous avons du rusher pour commander notre derniere tournee a volonte.
Mais le pire c'est l'hygiene!!!! Tres tres sale, le plancher, les tables, douteux sur la vaisselle, les toilettes horrible et pour finir l'un des serveur passait la mope pendant que nous etions encore en train de manger...sans compter l'odeur de la mope. Cher pour ce que c'est. Bruyant a souhait mais dommage car le concept est sympa.

569 Worst experience ever!!!! Too expensive for what it is. Dont recommend at all!!! This just happened tonight. We were a party of11 that ended up being one of 10 because I just got up and left because of the bad service. My sister made reservations at 5h45  she got there with her daughter and other sister 5 minutes before. But the manager wodnt let her ger seated unt at least there were 5 people and if no one came in 5 minutes they were gonna give the table to someone else.We were stuck in traffic and since no place to park, I dropped my mom, daughter and aunt and went looking for parking. After 20 minutes turning in circles I find a paying parking lot. I finally arrive and there is no room for me. I had to go get my own chair to sit because the manager gave one of our tables away. My brother had dropped his wife and kids and was looking for parking. I had been sitting for 15 minutes and no one had yet come and got me a plate or glass of water. 6 out of the 11 had already started eating. The tables are not proportionate whether it was a small or big  ne, there was only one bbq in the middle. Not practical.for those on the corners.Then the waitresses just came and shoved plates around in front of me not knowing who ordered them.  I tell one of them I just came and if they can get me a plate and menu. They don't say anything. Then the manager comes and  starts serving wine. I tell him what is this setting. How are we going to be able to eat properly? The tables are not proportionate. Not like the bbq on our bigger table is any bigger. He says yeah, it's true and keeps pourring the wine. 10 minutes later, still no plate or menu. I tell him will not be eating there so not to bill me and that their service is shit. He says ok and leaves. I couldnt beleive it. He didn't even apologize and offer any thing for the bad service. So I get up and leave. Since my daughter had already ordered and started eating,  she stayed with the resr of the family. I went back simply to pay for my daughter's bill and they had the audacity to add tips automatically. I refused to pay the tips. Then he says sorry but you know it's Saturday and it gets very hectic. I  tell him it is not my problem or responsibility. This restaurant had no respect for their clients and to top it all off it's too pricey for what you get. Don't waste your time and money.

570 I'd give this place 2.5-3.5 stars. The food is okay, honestly, we have just 3 or 4 spots in Montreal for people craving for BBQ..
It's better than Sota tho.
I don't really appreciate the service here. First, they assumed that we were Chinese and they spoke Chinese with us... Ofc we couldn't understand what they told us.
After, we ordered some side dishes and specially we ordered Takoyaki 3 times but they brought us these dishes after we finished our dinner :) It's ridiculous lol
The waiter who served us in the last minute was rude when we reordered the Takoyaki. We ended up having 2 small pieces although we ordered 3 times so it supposed to be 6 pieces. 
I went to Seoul Chako 2, 3 times and I think there is no special difference between Lunch and Dinner, just the price looooool.
Anyway, we chose Seoul Chako cuz we had no choice and at that time we were craving for BBQ and meattttt.

I think I'll try Gyu Kaku next time.

571 This is a great Korean BBQ place, provided you are willing to put through bad service, long waiting time and crowded space. 
I went here with family and we had to wait for about an hour, the lady at the restaurant was oblivious to the empty tables or the long queue extending outside in the cold. People in the queue were getting quite restless looking at the empty tables from outside. 
The food was like any Korean BBQ, nothing special. The pork and beef options were good, chicken not so much. 
They had a nice selection of desserts, however the staff was least interested in replenishing the ones that were over. 

I wouldn't go there again and don't recommend this to others.

574 It's been forever since my last Korean BBQ meal. Never been in Montreal for AYCE BBQ; I was pretty skeptical when I looked at the menu beforehand. Sushi at a Korean place? Never a good sign. Turns out the owners are Chinese so don't come here expecting the real deal. 

That being said, we were a group of four on a Thursday evening. Can't believe how busy it was. There was already a line at 6:30pm. One family I saw (also a party of four) didn't get sat for at least an hour. Yikes. Reserve (only can on weekdays). They almost messed up our reservation (took my friend's name down completely wrong) but everything was good in the end. 

There's three different menu prices. It depends on the time that you come and if it's weekday vs. weekend. 

- Lunch: Monday to Thursday (11:30am to 3:00pm): $15.99 vs. Friday to Sunday (12:00pm to 3:00pm): $16.99
- Dinner: Monday to Thursday (3:00pm to 10:30pm): $24.99 vs. Friday to Sunday: $26.99
- Late dinner: Friday to Saturday (11:00pm to 2:30am): $14.99

We tried most of the things on the dinner menu except for the fillers (aka. rice, deep fried and sushi). 
- Good: seaweed salad, kimchi radish, tofu skin sushi, sliced beef, short rib, ox tongue, salmon, clams (its spelt calms on the menu), corn, pineapple (wish they sliced these flat instead of bite sized) and fried scallop. 
- Decent: kimchi, salmon sushi (this is nigiri: okay but rice is bland), spicy salmon roll, spicy sausage, onion, zucchini and mushroom. 
- Bad: edamame (dry), green beans (frozen and tasteless) and all the desserts (vanilla, mango, green tea and strawberry yoghurt ice cream were generic and pretty unsatisfactory). Also tried the lychee jello (tastes like those lychee suction cup candies) and mango pudding (good but too sweet). Desserts were disappointing. 

Food was decent but service was pretty brutal. It was painful trying to flag down our waiter to get him to change our BBQ. We'd flag down other waiters and they'd say no problem but no one would come back. 

Can't say I'd return anytime soon. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere; so many amazing restaurants in this 'hood.

575 MAKE SURE U CHECK YOUR BILL BEFORE U PAY. The only reason I left this review is because it cheated us. Last nite 12 of us went there for dinner, service was ok, but at the end they over charged us for holiday price. After I went back to hotel and checked online, n asked my friends in Canada, there's no such holiday in Canada. We will never come here again.

576 I've been going there for such a looong time now so when they first started, they were the first one to really make korean BBQ famous here in montreal. It's always a nice place to go with a huge group and to just introduce korean BBQ to newbies. When you become more familiar with the place, you become less amazed and start to pick up on the bad aspect of the resto. The customer service is reallyyy poor: waiters ignoring you or your order, they are even rude at times, the long wait time for your order, even worse, sometimes they forget some of the dishes you ordered and its only after you've eaten everything else that you realise that they forgot 2-3 plates. Once, my group of friends and I felt discriminated (we were a group of black people) because all of a sudden when we asked for the bill, instead of our waiter it was the manager who came himself, took a good look at each of us, then gave us our bill. We felt that the service was sooo bad that we decided to not give much tip, but then the manager argued that for a big group like us we should give more tip... We were FLA-BBER--GAST! It was the last time I went there..

577 Yelpers beware: this establishment is in shambles. The food quality is really terrible. But what's worse is the service. Both the waiter and the manager were so unapologetic. The food was delayed, lost, and delayed again. The fire didn't function. And all the while the waiter and manager pretty much found the situation comical. Instead of apologizing, they made excuses and blamed it on capacity. The over experience was baffling. Save yourself the headache and go anywhere else.

579 There are not too many Korean Restaurants around Vaughan Mills area, so Mo'Ramyun is a great addition!

Menu though is small but sometimes it is good as less decisions to make and the kitchen can concentrate to perfect their offerings.

On a cold day, noodle seems to be a good choice. Some hot stone bowl rice? Those really hit the spot and make me feel nice and warm. Mo'Ramyun Chicken Wings coated in crispy instant noodle was quite unique. 

Mo'Ramyun is a good option for some non traditional Korean style food. Price is fair and service is decent.

580 Was in the mood for some ramen so my friend and I decided to try out the new Mo' Ramyun that opened across from Vaughn Mills. It looks very small on the outside but I'm pretty shocked at how spacious it is when we went in! 

It wasn't busy at all (probably 2 other tables), which is to be expected for a newer restaurant. I got there around 6 PM. The server was very quick to greet and seat us, which is a big plus. 

I opted for their most popular item, the Mo Ramyun! This is the perfect choice if you're looking to get ramen with a little bit of everything. I believe it came with pork belly, chicken, egg and some veggies. The server warned me that this may be a bit too spicy when I ordered it but the spice was very tolerable. Tbh it probably could've used some more spice... I guess it really depends on your spice tolerance.  

Now IT WAS GOOD, not gonna lie. But... I really don't think its worth the $15.95 price tag, hence the 3 stars. $12 maybe - but $15.95 is pushing it for literally a bowl of instant noodles with added meats and veggies that you can make yourself at home. 

We also ordered the ramyun chicken wings to share. It's super breaded, which I love! Its not the best chicken wings I've ever had but its still very tasty and a great appetizer to share with friends. 

Regardless of the price, I'd still recommend Mo' Ramyun to friends if they're really craving instant noodles and are too lazy to make their own ..and wouldn't mind spending. I'd probably still return, but I will try out other things on their menu. Hopefully it will be more worth the price tag!

581 Had been wanting to try this place out since it opened a couple of months ago. Finally went there today and was thoroughly disappointed. The food was just ok. Nothing special. The waiter was also not very friendly. The owner or manager, however, was very nice and courteous, which is why I'm giving two stars instead of one. Never going there again

582 One of my favourite places to go eat korean food in vaughan. Many of the dishes are very filling and tasty on top of that! 

The ramyun dishes are really good, the broth is really delicious and there's plenty of toppings!! I'd suggest the Mo'ramyun, any of the other ramyuns are just as good even the dry ones are pretty good! If you don't feel like ramyun you could always try the pork bone soup, the serving was very filling and tasty! 

If you don't want soup dishes you could always try the rice dishes, i've personally enjoyed all the rice dishes there! But the ramyun chicken wings are really good! The spicy cheese pork ribs/wings are really good, but if you're not into the cheese you can order it without the cheese just let them know.

Honestly I could go on and on about this place, and they just recently opened up near vaughan mills but it's one of my favourite places to go, the service is top notch. The environment and atmosphere are great! And you've got to check out they're washrooms they're amazing! Give this place a try!

583 Pretty great!

Let me start by saying how excited I am that Vaughan FINALLY has a Korean restaurant (even if its ramen). I also don't understand why so many reviews complain about the price. The average ramen bowl at any given restaurant goes for $12-13 and Mo' Ramyun serves ramen in GIANT bowls, hence the price tag. 

We came here on a Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty empty. Although it looks deceivingly small from the outside, there is a large dining room and even a patio (which will hopefully open in the summer). The menu is also fairly large (contrary to some complaints), there are Ramyun bowls and Dry Ramyun plates (noodles with no broth). The menu also has some appetizers worthy of checking out, like the fried tofu. 

We ordered the Mo' Ramyun ($15.99) which came with BBQ pork, grilled pork belly, and a lot of vegetables. The broth itself had a nice smokiness to it, which makes the dish really addicting. The only complain I have is that whoever cut the vegetables needs to improve their knife skills. The pieces were chunky and very uneven. We also ordered the Jajang Ramyun ($9.99 for a small) and the Jajang (black bean sauce) was not thick enough. The Age Tofu ($6.99) was great, although there was nothing aged about it. 

The service was fast & kind. The only issue I had was that the waiters stared at the patrons as they were eating. Not sure how the others felt, but it made me slightly uncomfortable. 

Overall, a decent restaurant with adorable decor and good dishes. Not a typical Korean restaurant (no banchan), but the portions make up for that. I think there is a lot of room for improvement, but given that it is a new restaurant, I hope that the owners take all the reviews into account.

584 This place was recommended by a friend and I enjoyed it.  For someone to say they were disappointed at the fact that a restaurant called Mo Ramen had limited selection of food because it was only Ramen seems kind of well...ridiculous.  Walk into Mr Sub and complain about their lack of variety of food.  Give me a break.  This is on point with the Ramen house trend.  The specialize in Ramen.  So my experience here was good.  Servers were great, very nice and had no issue with English from what I remembered.  Place was clean and food seeemed fresh.  I have it a three star because it didn't blow me away but I'd go back again for sure.  Went with 4 adults and 4 young kids.  I am Korean and my wife is Chinese.  Hopefully they keep their standards up. 3.5 more like.

585 I was craving Korean food and didn't want to travel far so my friends and I decided to give this place a try. 
The menu is pretty limited. The couple next to us ordered bibimbap and it looked really good so we decided to try it as well. The food came out sizzling and there was a side of soup included with the order. 
The food was pretty good and portions are big but I still feel it's on the pricier side. This place also didn't provide side dishes like how other Korean restaurants would. 
Overall, if I was craving Korean food and couldn't travel far, then I would come here again. Otherwise it wouldn't be my first choice.

586 As it was the first day of New Year 2019 and after walking Vaughan Mills mall, we wanted anything but Vietnamese. I also didn't want to drive to faraway being, hungry. Just when driving out from Vaughan Mills, across I saw Mo' Ramyun. We decided to drive over and checked out the menu. Thought sightly pricier, we decided to check it out. The portions were huge. The only discomfort was there's no side dishes. You've to order side dishes separately. A main dish range from $10-$15, average depending what you order.
At the moment if you tag them in your instagram, you'll get 5% off from total bill. I find this location better than the one in downtown, Baldwin. Taste and portions are good.

587 The best kimchi that I've tried. The foods was pretty good. I  recommend their kimchi fries (obviously). They're a bit pricier but they serve you large portion that are good for two persons. I'm glad there's now a Korean resto in Vaughan no need to travel far to Yonge & finch. 

& oh I just wish that they use authentic jajamyeon noddles and small order option for spicy rice cake. That's all :)

588 I went with a group of friends and I ordered the pork belly ramen and it was not very good. The portion was extremely small and there was basically no pork belly in my bowl. The broth had no flavour and was under seasoned which was a big let down as it was $12.95. My friend ordered the simple ramen with an egg, and got shin ramen. The broth and noodles was exactly alike to the instant noodle brand shin ramen. Also service was not very good as we had to ask for the bill 4 times before receiving it on a tame night. Would not recommend.

589 Opted for a quick meal after being at Vaughan Mills and regret choosing this place. 

The menu options are extremely limited and mostly ramen dishes (hence the name). The prices of their dishes are anywhere from $13+ and really feels like a ripoff when it's instant noodles with minimal veggies and meat.

Taste wise this place isn't bad but I'm really not feeling like there was any value ordering a $15 bowl of instant noodles. Most Korean restaurants also serve appetizers but this is not one of them.

After a day of shopping, you'll want to go somewhere else to get better value for your money. Avoid.

590 We were planning to go to Marcelo's and noticed something new in the block. It's Korean Cuisine. They posted their menu on the window and looked interesting. Except the grilled ribs or pork ribs I was told was discontinued. It's puzzling how a new place will discontinue something posted on the window but anyway, the server said they have a new menu. Place was empty. Guess because it was Monday and 3pm. Lunch was over. 

Small front but  spacious inside. We ordered the pork bone soup and the ramen with grilled marinated beef. It was very good. Pork bone soup was still boiling on its stone pot when placed on our table. The ramen soup has so much meat and the broth was perfect. Will definitely come back again.

592 Very disappointing. We ordered the other day from Skip the Dishes. We were very excited to try a new Korean place. We have our local favorite but decided to venture out. Portions and price are reasonable but taste is a whole other story. Three dishes - from most to least satisfying. Japchae - very tasty, the only tasty item. Tuna Kimbap - a little soggy, just didn't have the usual satisfying taste. Soon Tofu Jjigae - supposedly this has seafood - maybe 1 shrimp and 2-3 calamari rings. Taste, leaves something to be desired. Now, the Teokbbokki - JUST AWFUL. It was essentially drenched in black pepper and we couldn't even take a single bite. Recommend looking elsewhere if craving Korean. This place is likely to disappoint.

593 Their ramen noodles seemed like instant noodles so Instead I ordered Galbi, soon tofu stew and teokboki. It was pretty delicious. I cannot complain because there is no Korean restaurant in Vaughn.
I appreciate that I can finally just ubereat Korean food! Thank you:)

594 Westernized Korean Food. NO SIDE DISHES. MORE EXPENSIVE. 

I was completely surprised when this Korean restaurant did not serve side dishes. I even confirmed with the waiter who gave me a snarky reply...who disgustedly said no. OK, BAD SERVICE, let's go.

I expected even less after such a poor attitude. We ordered the the soon tofu soup and the dolsot bibimbap. FOOD WAS OK and had larger portions. They definitely toned down the spice level for us. The food didn't have the kick you would find on yonge street. 

The rice in the bibimbap really needs more salt or or a spicier sauce...there were dull parts of it. I know you'd say we should mix the food a bit more, but even the components weren't as on point as they should be. Nothing really stood out.

Next was the soon tofu soup. They chopped up the tofu and it felt like they reduced the amount that was put in normally. They did however add seafood and lots of shrimp, which I thought was nice considering it's higher price point.

To be fair the food was ok. A bit expensive and not traditional but it wasn't bad. And NO I won't be returning. Drive a few streets east and have yourself a real Korean meal. 

This should be a 3 star review, but poor service and attitude does make a difference!

595 We've been to Mo' Ramyun twice and very much enjoyed our food both times. 

The restaurant is quite small, but clean, airy and bright. Servers are efficient and quite friendly. 

The menu has quite a few options, including salads, appetizers, soups, gam ja tang, noodles, rice dishes and even some pub food options.

We've tried the ramen, bibimbap, gam ja tang and avocado salad. Everything we've had has been good. The gam ja tang broth isn't quite as rich as at some other Korean restaurants, but it's still pretty good. The ramen broth that we tried was very good. Unfortunately, the bibimbap doesn't have that lovely, crunchy rice on the bottom of the bowl which is our only criticism of that dish.

The washrooms are very clean and they even provide mouthwash and hand cream, which we thought was a nice touch. 

All in all, this is a solid Korean option in Vaughan and we'll definitely be back.

596 Never thought I'd have a good noodle place close to home! Let alone a Korean restaurant that I like the food at that's close to home!
The staff are rally friendly, they have quite a bit of seating, delicious food and just overall a great homey experience.
Would highly recommend if you're near Vaughan Mills and are craving good Korean food.

597 We had lunch here on a weekday. We got bibimbap, their signature ramen and wings for appetizer. The wings were good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The ramen was way too spicy even if the level was just regular. We had to take it home and dilute. The pork in the soup was tender and tasty. The bibimbap was good as well. Nothing stood out though. Maybe i still prefer the korean bbq format where you get to taste many side dishes.

598 I'm not a fan of garlic, and yes I know Koreans love their garlic (sometimes they can mask it really well, like in their marinades or pork bone soup) just didn't expect the cream sauce in the corn cheese ramyun to be like Alfredo sauce with extra extra garlic. The wings were also dry and the sauces didn't help much.

599 My wife and I were apprehensive after reading the reviews regarding poor service and the sushi not being great.  We were pleasantly thrilled.

We live in walking distance to the restaurant and pass it all the time.  I was under the impression that Korean BBQ meant you had to cook your own food at your table as I did long ago when i lived in L.A.  This is not the case.  

The atmosphere is modern and quality.  We ordered Soon Tofu Soup (seafood) and Dolsot Bipimbap.  Both were excellent and very fresh tasting.  

Las Vegans are often (always) in a rush, so i understand the slow service comments.  However, this place has the feel of a family restaurant.  A place where i want to take my time eating and enjoy the food.

My wife order the Maru Punch adult drink and she commented on how much larger it was compared to anywhere else.  On the strip, the drink would be a quadruple.  Have someone else drive you home if your order one.

The staff were very friendly and the place was spotless.  The hostess was super nice too.  She intruduced herself to all of the guests.

600 I almost don't want to write a review about this place, because I don't want to say anything bad.

First off, the staff is so so nice. I really enjoy them. 

The dining room is beautiful- I love the decor.

The food that I've tried just isn't that great. I've been 3 times, and only once was it good. But the staff is soooo incredibly nice, that I would consider going back to try some of the more adventurous dishes- and I would just stay away from the sushi. I just have so many other sushi places I enjoy more.

602 Nice and clean place, perfect for date night. The waitresses are always friendly, but service can be a little slow when it gets busy. That probably has a lot to do with the fact that I've never seen more than one waitress at a time. 
They have a beautiful full bar and a good selection of cocktails and beers. No sushi, which is a shame since the sushi bar looks really nice. 
I come for the Soon Tofu stew, which is always really good, but very mild. Ask them to make it extra spicy to get a more flavorful stew. 
The banchan is pretty good too. I haven't tried the barbeque, but I've seen others ordering it, and they look like huge portions. 
In short, good Korean food, probably your only option in the Summerlin area. Try if you're on this side of town!

603 I actually joined Yelp so I could write this review. The restaurant is visually beautiful. The quality of the sushi is above average. Pricing of food & alcohol is reasonable. BUT the service was so poor that  I will not return. More specifically, the all you can eat sushi is a SCAM. For the second time I noticed that orders are taken at the beginning of your one hour time limit, the quicker/cheaper items come somewhat quickly & the better rolls don't come until you have 5 minutes left - so you can't order again. I gave them the benefit of the doubt on my first visit but on the second visit it was blatant (there were only 2 other tables & a couple at the sushi bar the entire hour we were there). 
I'm not going to return for a 3rd trip to verify it again.
Long story short - don't offer all you can eat if you don't want to honor it or raise the prices & don't cut corners.

604 Ok, another stop during my convention stay in Vegas (paid for by one of my suppliers). Since I wasn't paying I was able to order pretty much anything I wanted, which was absolutely fantastic. I would highly recommend going to dinner when you're not paying!!! But I was there with about 100 other people. It must have been a doozy.

I alone ordered 2 orders of unmarinated dung-shim (certified angus beef steaks), 6 orders of marinated galbi bbq short ribs, 2 sashimi platters, 2 orders of uni, a sushi platter, and muhl naeng myun (cold buckwheat noodles soup). Ok, I didn't eat this all by myself. I was sharing with 4 other people. We also did have a bunch of alcohol too. 

The dung-shim was very good. The steaks were nicely marbled so they came out oh so tender. The galbi's marinated was pretty good (not too sweet or too salty and also tender). All of the fish came out very fresh, even the uni. Do NOT I repeat do NOT EVER EVER EVER order the muhl naeng myun. Horrible. WAY TOO SWEET. I heard the bibim naeng myun was pretty good. They brought out around 12 side dishes (banchan) which all were very, for lack of a better word, yummy. After this FEAST, I was VERY thankful I wasn't paying. I was estimating the bill came out to around $7000($50/person + alcohol).

Service was good considering they got slammed with 100 people all at once on top of their normal dinner crowd. The price was not so good. Looking at the menu brought fear to my wallet.  The owner did spend a pretty penny on this restaurant. Considering the neighborhood, she had to in order to make it fit the area, I mean she even put til on the stall walls! But it does look really nice. Very chic.

I would recommend it, even at that price. It is a bit far from the strip though, so get ready for a trek!

605 Not known by many due to its hidden location in Summerlin, this restaurant has a great Japanese chef that was recruited from Osaka and a Korean chef that was recruited from Shilla hotel in Korea. 
The Korean chef cuts the meat everyday only when ordered to be fresh, the Japanese chef cut a sashimi that was literally melting in the mouth. 
The interior design was done by a Korean architecture firm out of San Francisco and they have extremely unique vents and tables that were flown from Korea. 
Definitely try a Friday night since the last time I was there I saw Andre Agassi who is a huge fan of hers.

606 This is good Korean BBQ but very expensive, you can get just as good food much cheaper in Chinatown.  If you don't like to dine in those more authentic surroundings then this is the place for you.

We've also done the sushi here and it is good.  I'm not a fan of the rolls with tempura in them so I have the sushi and sashimi and it has to be VERY fresh and this was good if a little more pricey than some other places.

can't wait to see how the Korean BBQ compares to the places in Buena Park. I know it's not good for their business but I loved how dead it was for 9:00 p.m. on a Saturday night. Maybe 5 other customers. I hope it makes it because I look forward to becoming a regular.

610 There wasn't anything special about the food. We went to have all you can eat sushi and didn't feel like we got what we paid for. The service was average. The food literally took 50 mins to come out. Come on the place has a 1 hour time limit and took that long to serve. Basically we only got to order 1 round and that's it. The fish also wasn't really fresh and was obvious.  I felt the place was a rip off. Not everything was horrible, the restaurant has a nice interior design and atmosphere. But other than that theres way more better sushi restaurant better than this in las Vegas.

611 Korean and Sushi ....think again. We sat down and were given lunch menus with specials - all but one special included sushi! We made our selections not being informed of the recent departure as their name indicates. Still baffled as i write this why we were left to choose from the lunch menu. We then had to select again. Not impressed.  Green Tea?? Almost as much as an entree! 
Food came - it was good - not great.
Likely wont be back. Sorry Maru :(

612 This is the best Korean in las vegas as far as we're concerned. It's out of the way in Summerlin, but who cares, it's really good. Notably you want the Braised Galbi JJim. It is so very delicious, unbelievable flavor.

The Dolpan Spicy Pork (for two) is really good, but it's huge. More like a dish for 4 or more and order something else.

Nice place, friendly staff and solid food options.  definitely a win if you are looking for Korean in las vegas.

614 Maru is the perfect place to take your borderline adventurous eater friends--you know those people who might be up for trying a different cuisine as long as it is delivered in a trendy setting. I love trendy settings, but I also love tasty food served in less than fashionable surroundings. If I had to choose, I would take food over fashion any day of the week and twice on Sunday.

I went to Maru for a loner lunch and ordered vegetable sundubu. The ingredients are fresh, and the banchan kept me happy. However, the sundubu was mild and, sadly, bland. I hate sad sundubu days.

From reading the other reviews, perhaps the real star at Maru is the BBQ or bibimbap. Maybe they are so excited about meat that they forget about the timid tofu. I give them an A+ for interior. 

Right after my meal, I thought I would be giving Maru 2-stars, and solely for sundbu it may be 2-stars, despite the super fresh ingredients. Now, I am giving them a little bump for maintaining a clean, attractive restaurant that can serve as a gateway for adventurous eats. And lovebirds be advised: These are definitely date-quality surroundings (as long as you don't get the kid playing cymbals on the grill cover as your dining neighbor).

615 This place is good for lunch because I love their bimbimbop but that's about it.  My wife ordered AYCE sushi and I tried a few roles and it tasted like grocery store sushi.  Seriously.  GROCERY...STORE....SUSHI.  That is lame.  If you get AYCE (for $25 no less) it better be somewhere in between hi quality Ala cart and grocery store.  I'm pretty sure Albertsons has better sushi.  I also ordered the Korea BBQ Pork Belly and that was equally as disappointing.  The meat had no seasoning and no flavor.  I mean seriously didn't the silk road back in the day from east to west involve some kind of spice trade.  Somebody better let this Korean BBQ place know because I don't think they realize salt even exists.  The worst part about all of this is that this place is horrendously overpriced.  I had my daughter with me and I almost had to leave her as a tip.  Don't go here.  Drive the extra 10  minutes and hit up some of the Korean BBQ place in China Town.  So much better.

616 This place is fantastic. We had the Kalbi, Bulgogi and some of the sushi. The Kalbi is the best I have ever had! It is a pricey place, but the atmosphere and the decor are 2nd to none. Definitely a place I will be going to again. It's a little tucked away, but that helps with crowds. The bulgogi was ok, but I think it was because our server got busy and it got a little over cooked. Not a big deal since the rest of our meal was fantastic!

617 I was fooled by the two $$ on yelp. I though it would be a hole in the wall decent priced kinda place. Nope. The store front said it all. I knew I was gonna spend way more than I had planned to but I was too hungry to drive away. I was floored at the 29.99 for one order of Galbi. The Seafood pancake was 16.00 almost double of what I usually pay for. The banchan came out and it all looked really fresh and seasoned properly, they all tasted just as good as it looked not salty at all. All the veggies including the salad that came with the meal was the freshest veggies I've ever been served at a Korean
Restaurant. The amount of Galbi that came on the sizzling platter was a big disappointment for the price but the quality of the meat,the taste and texture was perfect. I have had better seafood pancake but it still was pretty good. Nothing went to waste I was pleased with every item. The restaurant was clean, bathroom was clean and service was great.

618 I stopped by for lunch today.   I had the bibim nangmyun, which is a spicy noodle dish made with buckwheat noodles.  The quality was good.  The right amount of spicyness.  The kimchee there is the best so far in Vegas.  The place is a little pricey( at these prices, I'd expect more side dishes).  I'll review again when I have dinner.

619 This place has gone way down hill since we last visited.  We went here for lunch yesterday.  It was very quiet.  The hostess was very unfriendly, couldn't break a smile the whole time we were there and when we said we didn't understand the menu she just walked away.  The waitress told us that the lunch menu came with rice and a salad.  So we were surprised when she bought us miso soup and tempura dipping sauce.  My hubby got his meal first and surprise it came with tempura!  Then we waited ........ and waited and waited.  We heard the buzzer from the kitchen and then I saw the chef come out looking for a waitress, no one in sight!  Finally got my meal and it was just ok.

Overall we were very disappointed we were there for an hour and hubby had to get back to work.  As we left we said thanks to the hostess and she just ignored us.  Maybe shes stressed because of the lack of business?  Well step it up lady!!!!

Will not be back!

620 This restaurant is easily one of the best korean bbq spots i've ever been to. How this place averaged 3 stars is bs. 

One of the first things that comes to mind with korean food is bulgogi. My coworkers and i ordered the lunch specials of bulgogi, pork bulgogi, stir fried chicken and a fish dish. 
The bulgogi beef was my 3rd best ever (1st in san fran 2nd in san diego). 
The pork bulgogi blew me away. The flavor was quite tasty but not overpowering.
If you are not a bulgogi fan then get the chicken stir fry and you wont be disappointed. 

Bulgogi and pork bulgogi. Its a done deal...

621 Yesterday afternoon we dined at Maru, a Korean and Japanese restaurant located off Town Center in Summerlin. I must say Korean food is not one of my favorite cuisines, perhaps because Koreans are very adept at food preservation and I've never been a huge fan of anything fermented, with the exception of alcohol. Something about the little fizz attached to fermented foods makes me a little squeamish. Kimchi is a great example, although it can also be prepared fresh, which I prefer. In any case, I like to expose myself to all cuisines so I still eat Korean food occasionally.

The Korean dish I like the most is bibimbap, which is not only fun to say, but also fun to eat. It is an authentic dish that is accessible to the American pallet, best served in a hot stone pot. It consists of white rice topped with a pretty display of meat, a variety of vegetables, and a raw egg, along with a sweet and spicy sauce. The first time my husband and I had this dish we got it without the egg and started eating the toppings first, dipping them in the sauce. We were corrected by the waitress who came over and poured the sauce over the toppings, then used a long metal spoon to mix all the contents of the pot together into a tasty hodge-podge. After she did so the dish made more sense, and the next time I didn't omit the raw egg since the heat of the rice and the pot cooks it to a state I much prefer. Bibimbap is served at almost all Korean restaurants and usually one pot is enough for two average eaters, so it is as affordable as it is yummy (at Maru it is$9.99).

Korean food is always accompanied by banchan, or little side dishes, so I find this is a good way to try Korean specialties without having to make a whole meal out of them. The side dishes can range from seaweed and fishcakes to cold mashed potatoes and kimchi, and generally you are served about five of them. The banchan at Maru are very good, and I appreciate that they always change so you have a bit different experience each time.

Ian ordered the spicy pork lunch special which wasn't as good as the bibimbap. The flavor was fine but the pork was very oily and it was hard to find the good cuts of meat in the pile. It came with mediocre tempura, an average salad, rice, and a delicious cup of miso soup (one of the better I've had). We agreed we probably wouldn't order it again.

Maru, which has a lovely modern dining room complete with mini atrium, also has a sushi bar. I ordered sashimi here once and thought it was incredibly fresh, though the rolls on the menu aren't as interesting as say, Sushi Fever. It's nice that the restaurant offers two cuisines so you can please all the pallets in your party, but really the bibimbap is the only reason I see to come here.

622 I am a frequent visitor in Las Vegas, and honestly this is hands down the best place for a nice authentic Korean BBQ meal.  The restaurant is located about 10 mins west of the strip, but it's well worth the drive.  I read many reviews on this restaurant pertaining to the sushi, but I don't tend to go to Korean BBQs for sushi.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, you can tell they spent some money on interior.   They have a room for karoke, a sushi bar, outdoor seating for the smokers, and a full bar.  When it comes to food, they definitely don't skimp on the the portions here.If you leave this place hungry, it's your fault because I don't see how it's possible with the ridiculous portions.  I highly recommend the Galbi Jjim and the Seafood Soup.   The Galbi Jjim is so tender it's amazing.  Love this place and will continue to come back.

623 Love this place!  Maru is a classy place to enjoy some good Korean food in a great location in Summerlin.  The beef ribs are very tasty and the Bibimbop is a hearty hot stone bowl!  Very clean and well done decor in the dining area.
What I really like is the husband/wife couple who own Maru's often oversee the food and service there along with stopping by the tables to ensure everything is good.

624 I tired this place after the reccomendation of a friend.

The restaurant was very nice and I liked the setup despite the uptight snooty atmosphere but hey its Summerlin so what do you expect. The AYCE menu was very dismal in selection and was not impressed by the little they did offer. The quality of the fish was good but they should ditch the AYCE and keep it old school and just offer specials on the rolls.

The service was ok but seeing how we went early before the lunch rush..its should have been better. We never actually got sushi plates which was rather annoying as well.

They did have the Korean BBQ setups at the table so perhaps the wife and I will return and give that a shot when it cools down but til then this is on my no go list.

625 We went here a week or so ago after purchasing a Groupon.We got the bulgogi ($25) and kimchee soup ($10). The food was fine but over-priced. I don't think I would go back. There are better Korean restaurants that are more reasonably priced.

626 Sat at the sushi bar for 10 minutes without water/service or even a greeting.  Yelp recommends? Thats disappointing.  I have been driving by here for 5 years, maybe I'll give it another 5.  Try Sushi Tower instead.  Now that is a 5 star place!

628 Super place to have some bibimbap at 10pm on a Monday night.  Even though it was late and they were going to close in an hour the food was delicious.  Can't wait to try it again, planning on going full on BBQ next time.

629 It's all about the bibimbap.

I came here for lunch with a $30 Groupon. The first thing I noticed was the modern and trendy ambiance. All of the walls seemed to be made out of glass, the tables and booths were made out of a dark wood that went well with all the bamboo lined up in the center of the dining area, and there was a colorful bar area in the other half of the restaurant near the restrooms. Since we came at 11am, there were only a few other parties, so it made for a very chill environment. 

After perusing the menu, we decided upon the Dolsot Bibimbap, Yokgajang, Jogi Gui, and chicken wings. The Jogi Gui was a lunch special so it came with rice, tempura, salad, and gyoza. We got our chicken wings first. They were pretty mediocre with nothing standing out about them besides the vibrant color. The Yokgajang came out in a giant bowl and it was more than enough for the both of us. I'm not a fan of anything spicy, but I actually enjoyed this (as much as my taste buds could handle). It was very flavorful and the spice definitely added a nice kick. The bibimbap came in a very large stone pot that took up almost the entire space in front of me. I've been craving bibimbap, so I dug in right away. It was hearty and delicious! I was so distracted by it that I just stopped eating anything else that we ordered and gave the bibimbap all of my attention. My favorite part was the crunchy bits of rice and egg that got stuck on the bottom of the pot. The dish went perfectly with all the banchan they gave us. If I didn't live so far, I'd probably come here twice a week just for the bibimbap. 

Overall, the presentation of all the food was perfect, the ambiance was very relaxing, and the food was tasty. I'd probably save this place for a nice lunch or dinner date though because you're definitely paying for the ambiance and I'm sure you'd want to enjoy it with someone ;)

630 I've been here twice now when I come in from SF and have had different dishes each time. This places is consistently and woefully desolate on a Saturday for lunch which is a true shame because it has really good Korean food! The kimchi pancakes are just right. The bibimbap is great, and the goon man du a solid 4 out of 5. 

This restaurant has a very new interior, is classy, and - what really counts - it has great food. 

Don't pass this one up!

631 I went to Maru once while attending a nearby conference. I took colleagues from Korea and Japan. They liked it so much they went back before 'Leaving Las Vegas'.  I also sent link to a local Korean who likes tidy clean places as much as he likes Korean food. He goes there all the time. So I'm surprised at the negative reviews. I will have to visit again when in Vegas area to reconfirm Maru's awesomeness because I found it really good!!  (I of course had the dolsot bibimbap - yum!)

632 Fresh, good quality ingredients in the dolsot bibimbap.

Was there right when the opened so was the only customers. Very attentive wait staff. Very nice decor.

This place rivals the Korean joints on the Asian Strip.

633 Having lived in Korea for several years, I can recognize and appreciate good Korean food. While it's not exactly like what one would get in Korea, it is very delicious. Probably the best Bibimpap in town, and best side dishes (banch'an). 

The only thing I've had that was so/so was the ddokguk. I've never had their sushi, so I can't respond to some of the bad reviews of it. But why go to a Korean restaurant if you want great sushi, anyway? For Korean food, it's tough to beat this place.

634 I have been to maru a few times. I have to say that it is the best Korean BBQ so far that I have found in vegas.

The bulgogi is really good also had the dolsot bibimbop and some of their tofu soups is a must.
 
Also had their sushi a few times and it was good as well.

The decor is really nice and the place is really clean.

635 I walked in and was impressed with the dining are of this place - it was rather tony.  It is a contemporary design and feels inviting.

I ordered a non spicy - spicy tuna roll.  (my kids will not eat anything spicy).  Then we went with the Korean BBQ dinners with short ribs and the thinly sliced beef .  

They brought out the side dishes and salad.  The kimchi, cucmbers, then they had some stuff that was tasty but I had no idea what it was, and potato salad.  Everything tasted fresh and well prepared.  

I have only been to a few Korean BBQ places but I am really starting to get in to it.  I am not an expert at Korean food, but this place was excellent.  I have been to 3 other Korean joints in town and this was by far the nicest one.

636 Love the spot, don't love the food.

Maru is a good spot for Korean if you just can't make it to Chinatown.   I've enjoyed their dolsot bibimbap several times and it's one of my favorites in town.  It's a big portion, so, come hungry.  Maru also brings out a decent selection of banchan and they are happy to refill, and refill, and refill....

Their seafood sundubu, however, is another story. It's watery and relatively flavorless.  Especially gross was that all the shrimp in my soup were not de-veined. Sick. The other seafood in the wasn't much better - mostly rubbery and overcooked.

Service can be spotty here, so, if you're looking for attention, steer clear.

637 Ok, it is Vegas and Summerlin, after all... so really should not expect authentic Korean food...that said, waitress brought wrong gochujang sauce for bibim bap...a Korean staple! When I initially asked for it, she had no clue! Enough said? Just more overpriced wannabee Korean fare...wish these restaurant owners would put more focus on taste and quality, no matter where you are!

638 Had a nice evening here last night with my wife. Nice atmosphere, clean and good service. Neither of us are Korean food experts but enjoyed our meals. The Dolsot Bibimbap was a very good dish, served with a raw yolk that cooked instantly when mixed.  We also had Bulgogi which was not bad but was overpriced for the quality of the dish which was just ok. The meat had too much fat in it. Overall good experience with a nice dining area.

639 We has a fantastic dinner! I was craving Korean and it had been far too long. 

We started with the seafood pancake, which was quite large and chalk full of seafood. I had the bipimbop (sp?), which is typically a rice, veggie, egg and meat sampler in a stone bowl served with optional spicy sauce. I asked them to leave off the meat (as I am a pescatarian), and the chef added some delicious tofu. Yum! The best part is the rice on the bottom of the bowl that gets crispy and delicious - it did not disappoint. My husband had the bulgagi (Korean BBQ). It was a very large plate of shaved meat that he absolutely gorged on. 

In all, we loved our meal. The restaurant was, sadly, quite empty. I hope more people try it soon. 

(Note: the negative reviews below are basically all about the sushi - especially the AYCE. The sushi bar was not open when we went.)

643 The owners also have a Korean Restaurant in China Town. The cuisine is the best west of Decatur. I have been there several times and have gotten a mixture of Korean and Japanese foods including some of the best sushi I have eaten in Vegas. If you have never gotten some classic Korean food get the Bim Bim Bap. It is a cold casserole with vegetables and meat. If you need help to eat it ask the wait staff they will definitely help you out.

644 What was fresh about this place?  The waitresses' bad attitude and poor service.  3 of us did the AYCE for $26, and 1 person ordered a korean dish.  

First off, when we got seated, the waitress took 3 out of the 4 drink orders, and then walked away. We had to shout the 4th drink order.  After we ordered our AYCE sushi items (limited to one order of sea urchin (uni) and 1 order of sweet shrimp, we waited... and waited... for our food. The appetizers like the tempura and gyoza were fine, although I had to ask for tempura sauce.  What place does not bring tempura sauce with tempura? This should have been a red flag, as I had to ask for it. The rest of the sushi came out very very slow, especially for being nearly empty on a friday night at 7pm.  
Finally the first sushi order (tuna) came out.  It's one thing if the sushi looks like it got rolled over by a car and died 2 weeks ago, but it actually tasted like it died 2 weeks ago and got rolled over by a car, and then sliced and put on top a very hefty wad of mushy rice.  It was tasteless.  The lack of flavor was attempted to be hidden by the sushi chef adding a clump of wasabi underneath.  
The rice quality was nothing that great either. It was a step above the quality of rice found at the supermarket.  
Everything else that came out had no flavor and there was a lack of excitement about the food.  
We had to wait 90 minutes before we finally got fed up, and said, where is our uni?!  The manager in charge said he would go check.  He came back a couple minutes later saying it would be out in a couple minutes as they just opened up a new box.  (Really?  they couldn't have opened up the new box when we ordered the food?)  The uni was fine, nothing horrible, but nothing that great either.  
The last sushi order they brought out was the white tuna which I usually like, but it was just horrible.  It was warm, melted in your mouth (not because it was good quality, but because it was just so waterlogged), and it had a weird almost alcoholic flavor to it. I spit it out and sent it back via the waitress who plainly ignored me until another waitress came by.  They were also very slow at servicing our table as we would stack our own plates to make room.  We also had to constantly ask for tea, but at least they kept my friend's soda cup full.  
My korean friend told me that her korean dish was awful as well. She only ate half of it.  
Overall, this restaurant is horrible.  The korean food is not good, and neither is the sushi.  1 star was given because that's the bare minimum that must be given and inside the restaurant looked very nice and modern.   This place does not deserve to serve sushi.

645 Maru was all in all a very pleasant and rewarding dinner location for me and my girlfriend.

First impression: Incredible curb appeal, very upscale, hip and classy decor and presentation.  In a good neighborhood.  Other Korean Restaurants in Vegas are in the part of town where you're concerned about leaving your belongings in your car... NOT MARU!  Its tucked away in a business section of Summerlin with plenty of parking.  There is plenty of room for waiting though we didn't have to.

Main Points: The restaurant is an authentic, Korean BBQ.  It is one of the few places in vegas you can get genuine Korean food prepared on a stove at your table or in a hot pot, served raw, etc.  Those reviewers criticizing the AYCE Sushi menu should bear in mind that this is not the primary focus of the establishment, but rather another offering to appeal to a wider audience, as Korean food tends to be extremely esoteric.  Service gripes seem to frequent some of the other reviews, but I have none.  Our hostess, waitress, and busser were all pleasant, helpful, and happy.

Food: I ordered four of the traditional, served raw Korean entrees and cooked them at the table for the full experience.  I was not displeased.  The quality of the ingredients was top-notch, and the facilities and atmosphere as well as the assistance from the wait staff was very helpful.

The AYCE sushi was ordered by another in our party.  If there is a scale for measuring Sushi quality, it would have grocery store sushi as a 1, and high quality a'la carte as a 10.  This sushi would have to be considered around a 4.  It was definitely good quality fish, and some of the specialty rolls are incredibly good, with interesting flavor combinations.  Some of the nagiri sushi, however, was a bit disappointing when compared with some other AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas.  I am readily prepared to forgive this though, for the reason mentioned earlier in the review.  The Korean food was superb.

Bottom Line: If looking for a night out at a classy Asian food restaurant with friends in Vegas, and you're off the strip, this is a very satisfying location.    Summerlin community, give them a try!

646 The first time I went to Maru, I went with a large group as a guest of a family member of the owners.  So we got personal service and never ending Bulgogi and Sushi.  It was my first Korean BBQ experience and I was hooked! 
The salad is addicting and sushi is good (not huge like many places, but nice manageable pieces) and Bulgogi is heavenly.  The decor is so nice and you feel like you should be on The Strip and not in a business park. 

Since then I have been to Korean Gardens, but decided to give Maru a shot with my own wallet (Ok, my Boyfriends) because we didn't want to go down to China-Town.  I might say that Korean Garden might be a bit better, but I would never turn down a dinner at Maru. I prefer that Salad at Maru over KG! hah. 

We went on a Friday night and were suprised how few other patrons were there.  It made me kind of sad  :(   

It deserves a shot!

647 How the hell can you claim to have all you can eat sushi when you damn selection is only the 10 basic rolls you can get an any other sushi restaurant for nearly the same cost as buying them individually?

I really want to give this place 1 star but I'm pretty much ranting on the AYCE sushi aspect of this restaurant.  I only came here because it was the closest sushi place from my buddies house and to be honest, I was PUMPED to come here since I was starving for AYCE sushi and wanted to try some new stuff.

The building is aesthetically pleasing and it does have a warm/cozy feel to it.  But the service was lacking (mainly since the waitress seemed to forget that I existed). 

Anyways, I look at all the stuff on the menu then come to find out every single thing I planned on ordering from the AYCE sushi was not on the AYCE sushi menu.

Fuck.That.Noise

I have never been so tilted after eating sushi, it fucking defies the laws of physics.

649 This spot is now closed.   It was located in the round about on Village Center Circle.  I did not like at all.  The place had gone down in quality so badly over the last 3 years.  The sushi bar was no longer open and the sushi menu no longer existed last year.

Most of the people I saw walking in and out seemed as if they were only taking it to go.  Every time I dined there during the day I was always the only one with my party there.  They had shabu shabu as an option but that sucker was double of the AYCE you can order from Swish.  Even with the lunch price cut from the $20 dinner menu it still wasn't  justifiable to spend that much.  

The one up they had over other Korean BBQ spots was they had a bar and TV, I enjoyed watching sports here because it was so dead and they had every channel.

650 I started with Kimchi. I then had the Sanchae Bibimbap. It is served unmixed, crisp vegetables with a fried egg on top, with a cup of chili sauce dumped on top. I know, right? It doesn't sound that good to me either. BUT, when you mix it together, it becomes one of the tastiest vegetarian dishes I have ever eaten! I Love Bibimbap! And it is fun to say, too.
The restaurant is Kubrikesque. There, I said it. See the attached pictures.

651 What an unexpected surprise to find a Korean restaurant so close to home.  We met for a family lunch one weekday afternoon and I was pleasantly surprised.  I give Maru an A+ for its decor, cleanliness, and service.  The restaurant wasn't very busy so I'm not sure what the service is like during dinnertime when it's likely to be busier but the waitresses who served us during lunch were very attentive and nice.  Our banchan (side dishes) and water were refilled without having to ask and she even took time to coo at our baby.  :)  I had the dol-suh-bibimbap (mixed veggies, meat, and rice in an earthenware pot) and hubby had the neng-myun galbi lunch special.  We were pleasantly surprised by the portion of the lunch special.  It was a pretty fair portion of neng-myun, although I have to say the quality of galbi wasn't as good (meat seemed too fatty).  My bibimbap was pretty good...and authentic.  The prices seemed kinda high but I guess that's to be expected in Summerlin.  All in all, it's a great neighborhood option but if you want some good Korean food you'll have to head closer to Chinatown.

652 Great Korean BBQ place in Summerlin! We had the Korean BBQ (pork and galbi) and the Soon tofu stew.  The BBQ comes with salad, which is delicious.  The meat was really tasty and they let us get half order of each so we could try a variety.  Comes with all the typical accrutements... kimchi, dried fish, white radish, pickled cucumbers, dried squid, etc. The stew was also great with lots of fresh seafood. We usually get Korean food in San Diego and this place is on par with the best places in San Diego.  It's nice to find a good Korean restaurant so close to home!  We didn't try the sushi, but we will try it next time and I will do an update.  

I also strongly recommend the martinis.  I had the pomegranate martini and it was terrific!  The service was impeccable and everyone was really nice and attentive.  The decor is really nice, too.  A lot of glass with bamboo trees in the middle.  

If you liked Sea Stone (how long was that place open... two days?), then you will love this place.  GO!

653 Our first visit here was quite enjoyable. Neither my fiance or I are familiar with Korean food, but we'd seen a lot of good reviews, and while we realized it was probably not that authentic, we thought it would be a good place to start. We both enjoyed our meals very much. He had the bbq ribs, which they snipped off the bone for him tableside, a nice touch, I thought, and I had the Dolsot Bibimbap. It was served with raw yolk (which cooked with the other ingredients when it came in contact with the hot stone bowl) and a delicious assortment of veggies. 

My only complaint would be that the menu was simply overwhelming. It seems like this place wants to be all things to all people and should really just focus on the things it does best. 

We will definitely be coming back for the BBQ!

655 I have never had the sushi here, my review is based only on my Korean food experience at Maru.

It doesn't compare to Mom's cooking, but it definitely satisfies my Korean food craving on those nights when Chinatown is just too far. The interior is very nice and always clean when I have been here. 

I usually order:

-pajun (kimchi pancake)
-seafood soondubu (spicy tofu soup)
-dolsot bibimbap (hot stone bibimbap)

Servers are friendly and the food is consistent. Banchan has been fresh everytime as well. Until there are more Korean options in Summerlin I will definitely continue to come to Maru, and even then, keep it in my rotation.

656 Have been here a few times. The food is not bad but not really great either when you are paying $30+ per entree. The service always seems sketchy. and a bit uppity a la Summerlin location . Last night, with just a few people in the place, we got seated right next to a couple chatting away. I felt like I was at the same table with them. Couldn't figure out why the hostess did this. We got up and went to PF Changs. Not a good experience.

657 We had been recommended to Maru by a friend so we went to check it out. It wasn't very busy and there were only a few tables occupied in the dining room. We were taken to our table by the hostess and then continued to sit there for 15 minutes while servers kept busy all around us. At about the 25 minute mark of sitting their with our menus without even being offered water or addressed by a server we left. Regardless of how good their food might be, that level or lack of service is completely unacceptable.  Instead we opted for Swish, the excellent Shabu-Shabu place around the corner. If you want to take your chances, go ahead but we will NEVER go back.

658 my mom and i went there and the cold noodle dish was horrible - the noodles were overcooked so that it was a pile of mush, not to mention that my order came about 20 minutes before my mother's and they kept telling us my mom's order was coming up -- i think they are still trying to figure out the service portion of this restaurant especially for Koreans... they are much better with their service to non-Korean, I felt. it would have been great to have a good Korean restaurant but this isn't it.

659 I came here for the first time many months ago. I had never tried Korean BBQ before and I wanted to give it a try. It was amazing. The food portions were more than enough and it was all delicious. The staff couldn't speak English very well but they were very helpful and considerate despite that fact. We have also been here for their sushi which I was weary at first because it was a Korean place. It was excellent as well. The sushi lasagna is absolutely amazing. I have never had anything so delicious.

660 Being new to town I tend to use yelp and urban spoon often to help guide me in a successful direction...... I have never tried Korean BBQ before, however, have heard friends talk about how much they loved it. Came across this place and decided to try it ...late night one Wednesday.
 I went around 7 with my boyfriend and we met another friend there. At the time (which I thought was dinner time) we happen to be the ONLY ones in the restaurant AND bar. As the peacefulness was nice I was a bit hesitant on ordering food from what looked like a pricey menu, so we started with drinks. 
As our hunger grew we decided to all share and get a few different proteins seeing as we were all first timers. We ordered  beef, chicken and pork. I liked how it came with so many sides as you could really create many different dishes. I as a simple eater however I am forced to try everything at least once as my boyfriend in a foodie!! The meat was all very well seasoned and flavorful, the apple mashed potatoes were an interesting pairing but good non the less.... I ended up mostly sticking to the beef and rice. I kept it simple! Although overall the food was good however I would think twice about going back as the bill was overpriced in my eyes for a dinner of rice and  beef

663 The good..
1) Beautiful place
2) Excellent service
3) Quality BBQ meat 

The bad...
1) Spoiled side dishes (KimChee & Spinach)
2) Fish cake was cold and disgusting.
3) Experienced diarrhea 10 minutes after finishing dinner.
4) Overpriced green tea ($5 for two servings)

First time we were here was about 2 years ago and the food was good. It appears this place has gone downhill due to the lack of customers and are compensating by cutting on their quality and raising their prices. What a shame.

664 It could have been the 2 miles straight up the side of that mountain I just hiked that made this place so amazing but I can't be sure. I am in love. I wish this place was in Texas though my husband surely doesn't based on their high prices. I say the prices may be high but the quantities are HUGE! The flavor of the bbq beef, spicy pork and seafood tofu stew were out of this world!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. Try it. You will thank me.

666 For the silkiest, most gelatinous tendon you've ever had the pleasure of putting in your mouth, get the #6 beef knee bone soup w/tendon ($15.99). Two days later and I still can't get over just how good it was...I love tendon and compared to pho, which has sparse amounts of meat with a lot of noodles, sul lung tang is the exact opposite (at LEAST 15 pieces). Dip that in their sauce that has a hint of horseradish (soooo good) and I was in heaven. The only thing I didn't really care for was the small amount of noodles in my sul lung tang - they were way too soft.

My friend's Korean boyfriend highly recommended this place for their sul lung tang as the best thing for hangovers, saying it was better than the places in LA which has an actual K-town. I've never had sul lung tang before, but I'm taking his word for it. The milky bone broth comes plain and you add salt, pepper, red pepper paste, and green onions to your liking. Not oily at all like how pho broth can be - definitely a healthy comfort food.

The ban chan here consists simply of two large clay pots of homemade radish and cabbage kimchi that you cut yourself, and a plate of fresh shishito peppers that you can dip in ssamjang. At first I was disappointed with the small variety, but oh my god that radish kimchi was BOMB. Pretty much finished that pot single-handedly, and radish kimchi is usually my least favorite type of kimchi. Their kimchi has a stronger anchovy taste which I personally really liked.

This mom and pop shop has won a special place in my heart. Totally authentic - the waiting list outside has names written in korean, they have a korean channel broadcasting on their TV, and you'll hear a the waitresses speaking mostly korean. Service is fast, and you'll never have an empty water/tea cup.

667 The best part of the meal is the self-served kimchee and piping hot comfort food.  You break out into a sweat afterwards, but it's a great change of pace. 

We usually go with the doganitang.  We dip the little pieces of meat in the sauce.  

It was about $15 a bowl, but with the unlimited sides and authentic taste, it's a great deal.

669 Great post-hangover or early morning breakfast soup in Vegas. I go to Vegas a bit for work and many times, I need a bite and leave for work around 8ish. This is one of the few places that I can go and rely on a hot soupy meal.

It's pretty standard, but it hits the spot -- especially in Vegas.

670 I actually enjoyed a lot of their beef tongue soup and beef brisket soup. I just felt there was not enough either beef tongue or beef brisket in the soup. I expected more from a bowl of soup cost me $12. Our meal came with complimentary kimchi and radish in big portion as appetizers. They both tasted very good. I was pretty much fed with rice, kimchi and radish because there wasn't enough meat in my soup. However, aroma of the broth was really good and soup tasted light and meaty.

671 So Rod U always talks about cartilage and bones and tendons. Some of the best ingredients in a soup that I can imagine. 

After reading his review several times decided to try this place. Love it. 

First is the green onions and chili paste for your soup. Peppers and dipping sauce that thankfully is not too hot and then bowls of kimchee the cabbage and radish. Love how you also have a plate to put the kimchee on and scissors to cut them. You can keep adding more kimchee as you eat them from the bowl.   The Kim Chee was absolutely awesome. 

We had the oxtail and the combo. They both come out very hot and you can add as much chili paste and green onions to your liking.

The oxtail was tasty and tender. I love to gnaw on the bones. The only thing I would say is a bit of veggies and bigger chunks of oxtail would make this an ideal meal for me. This was the first time I had oxtail soup instead if stew at a restaurant. I enjoyed this or at least the bits I could steal from the wife. 

The combo had brisket, tendon, tripe, and was tasty yet a bit sparse in terms of meat. I did not get any bones so next time I am trying the beef knee bone soup. Again I really enjoy more veggies in a soup as I make my own with pork bones , mushroom and cabbage. It adds to the overall consistency. Here I would say tasty yet anemic. Tasty though. 

I would like to give the 4.5 and will be back. I will try the 24.99 assorted boiled beef with some folks as I am sure you share this. 

Right now I would say that Soyo restaurant may have an edge on soups and plenty of banchan. I will be coming back to E-Jo to figure out what is what.

672 I don't live or work in this part of town, so when I do travel this way it is usually to go to one of the restaurants in the nearby Commercial Center or simply passing through.  So over the years I have driven past this unassuming restaurant that practically blends in with the other random businesses on this stretch of E Sahara, and never really given it a second thought.  So I am glad that we the typical question about where to get dinner ultimately lead us to E-Jo Korean Restaurant.

Their menu is pleasantly simple. Just 2 pages worth, and almost all of it is dedicated to the various traditional Korean soups not found at other Korean restaurants. These soups are the final product of hours of slow simmering to extract the flavors from the beef bones used in its preparation.  You can order the soup according to the meats and other ingredients that you want served in it.  If you are a beginner, then go with item #1 (Brisket Beef Soup for $9.99). If you are adventurous, then order item #8 (Their Combination Beef Soup with all the ingredients listed in items 1-7).

The soups themselves are what many would considered bland, but that is completely intentional. And sea salt is available on the table for diners to adjust their soup to their individual taste (very good for individuals with high blood pressure or are on a low sodium diet, since it is easy to add salt but impossible to get it out).  Besides that, there are Korean spicy chili paste and another soybean paste and garlic mixture for flavoring the soup or as a dip for the cucumber chili (most were not spicy, but there were a few that did packed some heat, so be careful if you don't like it too spicy).

In the end I opted for item #3 (Beef Knee Bone Soup with Tendon, $13.99).  If you like soft tendons, there are a lot of it in here, but no other pieces of beef.  Overall, this alone was just okay for me even with all of the tinkering that went into fine tuning my soup.

The surprised highlight of the meal for me and probably everyone I ate with (Michael K and Roger T) is the restaurant's house made kimchi (2 varieties: radish and cabbage).  As far as banchans are concerned relative to other Korean restaurants, the selection is minimal.  However, what the E-Jo lack in kimchi selections is more than make up by the quality and flavors that they packed.  I will be happy with a few servings of rice and their kimchi, and maybe just a small bowl of soup or side order of Stir Fried Ribeye or Spicy Pork.  The kimchis are that mind blowningly good!  Forget the other K-Restaurant's commercially sourced industrial kimchis.  I want E-Jo's artisanal kimchi goodness!

Service was friendly and efficient. The food came out with nominal wait time.  You can help yourself to as much kimchi as you want.  However, be polite and considerate and get the kimchi out of the jar with the provided tongs and put it on the serving plate first (no ones wants your cootie crossed contaminated double dipped leftover kimchi, not even your GF or BF).

In the mood to drink responsibly?  They offer, you guessed it, Soju!  Plus Korean beers and rice wines and soda for me.

For entertainment, besides staring at your iPhone or Android devices and neglecting your dining companions (okay if you are Yelping, but only because I am Yelping too), catch up on Korean programming of the variety show category on their TV (at least that was what was on at the time of my visit).  

Afraid of ordering wrong because you are not Korean, can't speak Korean, but you still want to madly impressed your Korean GF or just being  culinaryly (I am making up words because of their kimchi) adventurous minus the requisite language skill, have no fear! pictures of menu items are on the wall for easy visual reference.  Or just ask the restaurant staff taking your order, silly.

(Getting the frantic hand signals to wrap it up)

E-Jo, a good Korean soup restaurant to visit, especially as the thermometer starts dipping towards your feet.  Lastly, awesome kimchi!

4 stars! **** out of *****

Trivial observation: Their soups all look the same to me here.  But I can assure you I am not a soup racist. I have had soups from many culinary traditions in the past. Just the other day I thoroughly enjoyed a miso soup, and before that an Italian Wedding Soup, and a very invigorating cold Borscht from Russia (or was it or Ukrainian origin) just over the summer. My point is I am not a soup racist.

673 The place is rundown and shabby. The lady is nice but the food is quite poor. I had the oxknee soup, spicy pork, hangover soup and handmade noodles. The oxknee soup was so bland. Adding chili didnt help. The hangover soup tasted like yuckt simmering vegetables. The noodles were bland too. The spicy pork was okay but not oustanding. It was abit too oily. I like their kimchi though. All in all, not recommended.

674 Summary:
All the soups are delicious and are a great treat when the temperature is cold outside. Often go up to 3 times a week dependent on the fact of if I have a hangover from drinking or not, or if I want something not as salty and heart warming. It is more or less like chicken noodle soup for Asians.

Decor:
Very cute and Korean inside, I love the Korean TV playing in the background. The chopsticks, pots, bowls, and even how kimchi is presented is very cute.

Service: 
Great service and since the server found out that our party was not Korean so she explained in how to eat the soup properly (adding salt and onion, meat dipping sauce, cold dish peppers, etc). 

Price:
Ox tail soup comes at a pleasant not too expensive 15.99 while the best bang for the buck my favorite would be #2 which include all sorts of meat and intestine (12.99). The basic Brisket Beef Soup is 11.99. All the soups are very well priced, not too high but no steal for sure.

Final Thoughts:
Delicious and good for cold days. Or if you have been drinking or is sick, the soup is to die for.

675 I've been there a total of two times, and I always love the kimchi. However, the last time we went was a disaster. When we first got there we didn't get a word in before she started pointing at the menu items and recommending the common safe dishes like bulgogi. Since we weren't Korean she probably assumed we wouldn't like the soups(which is basically what they are known for). It doesn't make sense to recommend something that isn't a house specialty. Then after we ordered two of their soups she asked us if we wanted kimchi. What do you mean, would we like some? It's a Korean restaurant, of course we want kimchi. It's always a provided staple. Again, just because we were foreigners and she didn't expect us to be knowledge or appreciative of her cuisine. She never refilled our drinks even though the restaurant was small and we were one of two customers. The worst part was at the end of the meal. I left a cash tip on the table and my boyfriend went to go pay with card. After he signs the receipt and starts walking away she yells after him telling him he didn't leave a tip. He felt embarrassed, especially since she yelled in front of her other customers. If she had bothered to walk to the table she wouldn't have seen the tip.

677 There's not much to say about this place. No frills, minimal dining decor, tasty fucking food. Some of the best kimchi and daikon radish I've ever eaten in my life.

The beef brisket stew may be a bland dish to some but this place knows how to make it so hearty and warming, I drank all of the broth til it's last drop. 

This place is a gem and I'm glad I visited.

678 My friends frequent E-Jo for their tasty, authentic Korean food. I'm a vegetarian so I can't eat too many things on the menu as its not vegetarian friendly. Then why rate it 5 stars, you ask? Because my friends say the food is amazing (I used to be a carnivore and trust their taste buds), the service, and the BOMB kimchi. It was so good I'm going to go back just to eat some of that! My hubby and I moved to Vegas a couple weeks ago, so it's nice finding these gems here in LV. Def coming back again and again.

679 Great place for bone soup and delicious kimchi.  On the way home from Las Vegas Strip we stopped here for breakfast.   We shared oxtail soup and mulnangmun.   The soups were so flavorful and their house made Napa and kkakdugi kimchi were amazingly tasty.  It is unfortunate that they do not sell any kimchi.   Great service.  We will definitely be back.

680 So unfortunately the best Korean restaurant in town is on the east side, far far away from my house...  This place across the street from Commercial Center is, in my opinion, the best traditional Korean restaurant in Vegas, by a mile.  Most Korean restaurants are bbq places, and even those are just mediocre.  The only other specialty Korean seems to be tofu joints, except for this place which specializes in gomtang, a soup that is similar to sullungtang and cooked in bone marrow.  

They have parking in the back, but you have to walk around to the front to enter.  It is your typical Korean restaurant decor, which is to say it's not much to speak of.  Service is friendly and speedy.  The menu consists of a various type of gomtang (different main ingredient) and several other popular Korean dishes.  Although oxtail gomtang is one of my favorite dish, we opt for a combination gomtang and a naengmyun.  I'm guessing the gomtang is already made, but perhaps because of naengmyun preparation both dishes take about 10 minutes to come out.

The naengmyun is quite good, with nicely flavored and cold soup.  Wish there was a tad more brisket slices in it though, but otherwise very satisfying.  The gomtang soup tasted great also, and the accompanying kimchi and radish kimchi (kkakdugi) were outstanding.  The kimchi is quite sweet, but I actually liked it.  I am definitely getting the oxtail gomtang next time.

I've probably tried 90% of Korean restaurants in Vegas, and it's not an impressive lot overall except Soyo which is very good, K-bop which is satisfying, and couple in Commercial Center that have a handful of good dishes.  So this one is a keeper, with great service and food on par with typically good places in L.A.  It's a solid 4 stars.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Most places like this are just fine for eating alone.

682 Ventured here with our Korean friend, who we promptly put in charge of ordering. The kimchi cut fresh at the table was the best that I have ever had - the radishes were especially delicious. 

Don't ask me the authentic names, I don't know them, but the pancake, beef with veggies, and the assorted beef soup were all incredible. I tried beef tongue and tendon for the first time, and thoroughly enjoyed both. The tendon is a bit gelatinous, and the tongue tastes just like any other cut of beef. We got two cold buckwheat noodle dishes, and I definitely prefered the broth preparation to the chili paste preparation. I WILL warn you however, that these noodles were EXTREMELY difficult to bite through. I took a big bite thinking that I could just bite them off, but I couldn't, and kind of wound up choking a little. The super kind server came rushing over to see if I was okay, or if the food was too spicy. And I was embarrassed. White chicks eating Korean food wrong. Boo. 

But it was no big deal, I took smaller bites and loved every minute. The staff is very friendly, and helpful if you aren't exactly sure what to get.

683 I will begin by clarifying that I am not Korean, so I may have different tastes than other reviewers about E-Jo.  I ordered the Hangover Soup, and it was missing a certain something.  I added kimchi into it, and it was a bit better.  

The kimchi cabbage and the kimchi radish that accompany the meal were good, but it was not the best I have had.  Once again, I am not Korean, so maybe that's what authentic kimchi tastes like.  I have, however, had kimchi in Seoul airport before, and it did not taste like what E-Jo had to offer.   All in all, I don't think I'll be returning soon.

687 Traditional Korean restaurant with the food I grew up on. My favorite is the Oxtail soup #4 and my husband's is #1 (beef brisket). He says it reminds him of his Czech grandma's broth. Arrives bland but add salt and it becomes a very rich and flavorful soup. Dump in the rice, and it's the perfect comfort food. It's our go-to when we're sick or just craving a soul-warming meal. I personally haven't liked any of their noodles, however, but their soups are so good that I overlook it.

689 This place was ok/good. Not as good as I expected with the 4 1/2 stars that it got. The banchan was good. You only get 2 kinds though, the kimchi and the daikon.

Pros:
-slightly off the strip on Sahara, less traffic.
-the portion was good in comparison to the price (based on the chicken that I ordered)
-nice/friendly waitress (the one that took my order was very nice). Even said good bye as I was leaving. 

Cons:
-The price is higher than some other places. 
-The chicken I got was good, but was more like a stir fry than Korean bbq. I wanted bbq.

I wanted to order the short rib, but it was $25 bucks a pop, so I opted for the chicken instead ($15.99). For that price, you might as well pay a little more for a nice buffet.

690 So I decided to come here because I was meeting up a friend and she chose this place!  This place seems so shady from the outside! No kidding! I was scared to step outta my car!

I ordered an oxtail soup and I'll tell you that it was amazing! I really loved their red bean paste, we cut up our jalapeno and then just dipped it into the paste. I ordered the oxtail soup. It was a bit bland but it was refreshing. I added the hot spice they had and the bean paste and it helped. It was really good! I'll tell you they're pretty generous with the amount of oxtail that was in it! I'll def come back next time and try their hangover soup too!

691 I was here in a Wednesday afternoon. Business was very slow. The location was kinda bad?! (I am an outsider).

The food is on the pricy side, but it's very traditional.
They only provided three side dishes. (Two kinds of Kimchi and the green peppers)

I ordered the mixed beef soup. It came with a bowl of rice. It was delicious, but I probably will not go back due to the location.

692 We all have been to a small mom and pop restaurant that makes great food.  E-Jo is one of those places.  Appetizer was these large peppers with dipping sauce.  I was dubious about trying it, but trust me, it's pleasantly yummy.  For dinner, I had the spicy pork, and it was delicious.  The rest of my family had noodle soup (their specialty) and it was well enjoyed.  Service was excellent.  Staff/owners were very nice and accommodating.  
If you're looking for great Korean food off the strip, this is it!

693 If you're craving authentic Korean food in Vegas, this is the place to go. Parking is easily accessible; there's a lot right by the restaurant. We got seated immediately when we went this past Sunday during lunch hours. But, the service was really slow because there was only one worker. We waited around 30-45 minutes to get our food. 

Despite the long wait to get the food, the dishes were on point (reason why I gave it a 4-star instead of a 5-star).The mixed Korean oxtail soup (sukkuh gomtang) was rich and flavorful. It was up to par with the ones in LA. The knife noodles (kalgooksu) and the cold buckwheat noodles (mool naengmyun) were really good as well. The dishes were anywhere around $10-$13. I would definitely come here again! 

Recommendations: mixed Korean oxtail soup, knife noodles (Kalgooksu) and cold buckwheat noodles (mool naengmyun)

695 Anyone who knows me will tell you that i LOVE the little hidden treasures that serve up good food with good pricing! This, my friends, is that little treasure nestled in a small corner on E Sahara right past Paradise. I love my Korean food, but most of all, the hearty soups that  make you feel all fuzzy all over, not to mention the home made kkakdogi and kim chi. The lady that runs this place is very nice, and the service was good. We had to keep asking for water refills, but it was no biggy. with your meal, you get the korean green chiles and its served up with a fermented soybean sauce mixture to dip it in. Its refreshing but hot when you get to those seeds!!! YIKES! I have been looking for a place that serves up good seollangtang here in Las Vegas, and thought I found one, but they stopped making it. Really? Ugh, so i was on the search again, and then WALLAH!!! E-JO came into the convo from a friend, and she said her fav soup was like a MILKY based soup. Ding Ding Ding, it was right on. Seollangtang!!! This is sort of a milky bone soup that served up with slices of brisket and somen noodles. Its not salty at all, so when you get your soup, you are given salt, green onions and chili pepper paste to put in the soup yourself to control the salt and spice level. SO ONO!I But on the menu, this is the #1 dish on the Menu, Beef Brisket Soup.  This place definitely does seollangtang right, not to mention the price is reasonable. I haven't tried any other dish from this place (sad i know) but I'll give other dishes a try when Im tired of this soup. BWAHAHA! Yea right. But in all seriousness, i will give the other dishes a shot too!

698 Always go to this place for authentic Korean soup. I'd say their one of the best one here in the valley. But as I write this review I'm here again on countless visits as they give us a NEW menu. I was thinking it's the TOURIST menu since everyone here are Koreans and judging from the tour vans outside the restaurant. The price is $2. More!!  I ask for the other menu, the one I'm used to (with photos) and $2 less on some of my favorite (hangover soup). Other than that the food is still good but will definitely think twice about coming back.

699 I don't get the high ratings here. Came because we needed to replenish our souls so we ordered the oxtail soup and handmade noodles soup. The oxtail soup had only four really small pieces and the flavor couldn't be more bland that you had to seasoned it yourself. No trace of any beef bones used to make the broth. The noodles had a nice texture but nothing more to it. $25 is rather pricey for two soups when realistically was barely enough for one person.

700 There's something magical about their beef brisket soup. It's so plain and simple, basically just meat and noodles in broth, but always hits the spot once you add in the flake salt and chili paste! I also include a generous heap of green onion with mine. You get this little dish of vinegar sauce to dip your meat in, which adds to the taste as well. And with most Korean food, it comes with a bowl of rice.

The banchan includes only three items: green peppers with bean paste, radish kimchi, and cabbage kimchi. Just forget everything but the cabbage kimchi because it is literally the best kimchi I have ever had in Las Vegas. The flavor is so on point! It's never over-fermented either, which I hate. 

The price is a little steep (~$15) considering it's a very simple soup and you have to do some work yourself, so I don't come here too often. But when the craving hits, it hits hard! E-Jo will always have a special place in my heart...Err, stomach.

The place could be a little cleaner...

702 I've driven by this place many times and saw the decent reviews on Yelp. The area is pretty sketchy so I parked on the side street since there was additional lighting.

Being it was a Tuesday evening there were only a couple of other patrons. I was greeted by the friendly Korean woman who immediately brought me ice tea which was refreshing. Being that E Jo is popular for their soups, I went with their combo soup which had 6 varieties of meat in a yummy broth and noodles. The soup included fresh tasty ban chan and rice.

I'm so glad I tried E-Jo Korean Restaurant - good food and friendly service will have me returning again.

703 Came by because it was right down the street from JZ Billiards & we were hungry. I didn't realize this place mainly serves soup but I was kinda hungover from the night before it worked out ok. 

I ordered the beef brisket soup & the bf ordered spicy pork. I've never had this kind of soup before so I didn't know it comes to the table with no flavor. You add your own salt, miso & whatever else they put on the table. Once I added salt & other stuff it was pretty good. The spicy pork was very tasty. Came with rice, Kim Chee & Kim Chee radish.  

Service was good, food was good, parking was easy. If you have a hankering for korean soup give this place a try.

704 During our last trip to Vegas, we found a few new places to add to our list of favorite eateries and this place came up top for future visits.  Their kimchee was very good!  The 3 of us each ordered the mix meat tang and we enjoyed every bit of our soup.  We wanted to stop by again for a 2nd time before leaving, but our trip was so short we didn't make it before our flight back home.  We will definitely make it our regular stop every time we visit Vegas, as long as they keep up the excellent flavor.

Just writing this review already makes me want to go back and have another bowl.

705 Catered to the hungry, and hungover. This is a traditional old school Korean restaurant, known for their authentic Korean dishes, but popularly known for their gom tang (oxtail soup).

I even threw in some kimchi. the first smell that hits you.... It did remind me of the times when my mom made this soup. friendly staff, fast service. I might be back to try other things on the menu, mainly the kalgeuksoo, which was my childhood favorite.

711 It has been sometime since I've come here. Not because this place isn't great but it's because its super far from me! I rarely am on this side of town.

In 2014, this place was first introduced to me by my friend. She has since moved back to her country but E-Jo will give me fond memories of her.

I came after class. It was a little busier than I remember it. But this is like a mom and pop store. They don't typically sell the tofu soup or the typical Korean BBQ dishes. So if you're looking for BBQ or Tofu soup, this place probably isn't it. 

I've tried the oxtail soup, the hangover soup, and the beef tongue soup. ALL WERE AMAZING! When you're feeling cold or need something to warm up the belly, this is the spot.

The oxtail soup was clear and full of flavor. Now, please keep in mind it's not seasoned. They give you sea salt on the side and some red sauce you can put in it or other things you can use to season it. I'd suggest 2.5 spoons of salt and some of that red pepper paste, not the dipping one! 

The hangover soup is probably my favorite dish. This one needs the least amount of seasoning because the soup itself has a lot of flavor. If you love a load of veggies, that is THE soup to go for. However, if you're not a brave soul and can't eat that pigs blood, don't do it. But I LOVE pigs blood.

The beef tongue was really great! I was hesitant in ordering this because through my experience, the beef tongue is usually very chewy if its cooked in soup. Well, I'm glad I picked this soup! Once again, adding 2.5 spoons of salt (lightly, not loaded spoon) and that red pepper paste it was full of flavor and delicious. The beef tongue was the softest beef tongue I've ever eaten! It was great! It also had a dipping sauce that my SO hogged so I didn't get much of it, but whatever I  had to dip it with was great!

I forgot about that bonchon, its pretty simple, but I LOVE their kimchi! Kimchi, raddish kimchi, and korean chili peppers. This place is the only one that does the korean chili peppers but i find myself craving these every so often and dipping it into that seasoned red pepper paste. YUM!

712 If you need some good Korean soup to calm the soul, this is the place in Vegas you want to go to. The kimchi is good as well. It's not as good as the LA/OC Korean restaurants in the U.S. but it comes pretty close. Plus, after a hard night, I don't think you'll notice the difference. 

Tip: You want to make sure they took your order right.

We enjoyed the stay and refreshing iced tea that was served in place of water. 

One thing i was not to faun of was the small dishes everything was served in. I felt like i was on a diet. Awesome food though;)

717 Delicious.  We always have the beef brisket soup and kalbi.  We love it.  The sides (ban chan) are always kimchi, radish kimchi and peppers (that you dip in spicy soy bean paste).  But this is really all you need for the beef brisket soup.  Traditional.  The side dishes are very good as well...but you cut yourself...which a lot of Koreans love this style.  Kalbi was very good as well...actually my daughters favorite here.  
The soup is just nice on cold day or as a hangover cure. 
The soups btw are bland...but traditionally the soup is served with salt, green onions and red pepper flakes for you to season yourself.

721 As Korean, I really love their Kimchi rather than their main meal. That doesn't mean their food is horrible, just want to say their Kimchi is really good. ( at least to the person what is Kimchi and what is taste like ).
Everytime I visit Las Vegas with my wife, we visit there and take a least one meal.
If you are Korean or love Korean food, but just take ton of meat or buffet during your stay in Vegas and want to try another one, visit here and try it.

Since it's Korean restaurant, Kimchi will be refilled everytime you want/ask to the staff. Affordable price ( than others in Vegas ).

This is located in Sahara Ave street, but it wasn't easy to find it at first time... since I rely on my stupid navigation. 

I remember the restaurant also sell Kimchi to the person who want to buy it.

Not many person knows here, so if you visit the restaurant in the morning, there should be almost no one except the person who knows here is awesome and quiet in the morning.

Their most popular dish is #1, the beef brisket soup and it is soooo rich and nutritious.  I wanted to try their oxtail soup too but I ran out of time.  Check them out!  They're just about half a mile away from SLS.

725 I stumbled onto this gem while in Vegas. The food was absolutely delicious. I don't know what authentic Korean food tastes like but if I had to guess, it would be at this restaurant. The servers were so sweet and took the time to explain what I was getting as I had no clue. If I am ever in Vegas again I would most certainly go back and even want to find Korean restaurants here in Orlando now! This place has set the benchmark for what I would want to have from now on not to forget the price was really cheap for the amount of food I got!

726 No, how is it possible that this place has a 4* average? I'm not Korean but having lived in LA Ktown for a large chunk of my life, I know good Korean food when I taste it. And this is just not it. Our group was originally headed to KBBQ and while in Uber, we were somehow misled to believe the E-Jo would be better.

The server was super friendly and tried to accommodate our large group. She even held an empty table for us because we said more of our group was coming. Although the service was great, the food was disappointing. I had Mul Naengmyun, one of my favorite Korean dishes and something you would think is perfect for the Las Vegas heat. The noodles were not cold enough and they just didn't seem to be the best quality. The broth left something to be desired.

I also took a few bites of his spicy BBQ chicken. I'd recommend you pass on that dish as well. In a city with so many great restaurants, there's no reason to subject yourself to the low quality and high priced food at E-Jo. The best part was the kimchi.

728 E-Jo is located in a small shop on the other side of the commercial center. The simple sign is easy to pass up so keep your eyes peeled, because this place is not one you will want to pass up. 

The dimly lit restaurant made my sister initially curse, because she thought it was closed. 

Once we sat down, the waitress brought two cups of the iced barley tea. No chilled metal cups, but the tall plastic ones will do. 

The food is similar price to other Korean restaurants in Vegas, but that is the only similarity they share. The thing about E-Jo is that they do not serve the most common Korean soups, so you will not find kimchijjigae (kimchi soup) or soondubujjigae (spicy soft tofu soup). Instead they had a beef brisket (9.99), tripe, tongue, and an all of the above soup (13.99). My sister and I split the beef brisket and the cold buckwheat noodles in a chilled soup (9.99). The former was steaming hot with generous amounts of meat and noodles. It comes with a bowl of rice, a huge pot of cabbage and radish kimchi, and lots of green onions to sprinkle in. The best way to eat it is to throw your rice into the broth and add gochujang (the red chili paste). A dash of salt goes a long way too. Like seullongtang, you need to season it to your liking, otherwise it might be too bland. Another way I learned to eat it, in Korea, was to add a little bit of the juice from the radish kimchi. It might sound odd, but the taste is amazing. 

The naengmyeon is a true summer dish. The tangy vinegar beef broth is chilled with the addition of ice cubes. It comes with half a hard boiled egg, two pieces of brisket, pickled radish, cucumbers, and a horseradish mustard on the side. My sister has been complaining about how unbearable this heat was and she was relieved to devour this dish. The banchan are minimal, but what they do give is top notch. I almost inhaled both pots of kimchi and they do not skimp on the portion. There were also some cucumber peppers that are served with ssamjang (a mixture of garlic, red pepper and soybean paste). They are not spicy and perfect for summer.

729 This is the best Seulrangtang house in Las Vegas, from most Korean I know. 

Old fashioned, but great tang taste. Servers are not much attentively helping customers but they are friendly enough to please customers.

730 Came here tonight bc it had such high ratings and I needed a Korean restaurant for my Korean mom and Korean Aunt, who need to always eat Korean food. :) Anyway, we grabbed a taxi from the Wynn (where we were staying for the weekend) and went over. In hindsight, I should've just driven but I was too lazy to get my car out of the parking structure. It cost $11 cab fare to get there. Then I paid $5 tip. I know. Dumb. It was actually worse on the way back. The owner of the restaurant called us a Korean cab to get back to the hotel. He charged us $20!!! What a ripoff!! Anyway, I digress. So, the moral of the story is if you decide to check out this place, and you have a car, just drive there. 

So, I got the oxtail soup, my mom got the Kalgooksoo, and my Aunt got the soup with the greens in it. I thought my oxtail soup was  good! Broth was flavorful. My meat was a little tough...I mean I was fighting with it to get off the bone. But still pretty good. The cabbage Kimchee and the radish Kimchee both were really good! They also gave us peppers with daenjang. The peppers with fresh and crunchy! Really good! 

My mom and aunt said their food was just ok. They said it was bland. Lol. But they live in LA, so they always compare Korean food to the restaurants in Ktown.

Overall, I thought the service was great and the food was pretty good. If I have a craving for Korean food in Vegas again, I will be back.

731 I recently visited E-Jo on a Friday afternoon. 

My friend and I ordered the kalbi and it was superb. The kimchi and pickled radish were the best I have ever had.

E-Jo isn't fancy, merely functional. There were many Korean people there which is always a good sign. The server was friendly and helpful.

I will definitely return!

732 I love this place! 
E-Jo is definitely one of the true authentic Korean places to eat at, in Vegas. 
The radish kimchi is the best.

They specialize in soups so order up!
Have a hangover? Try the oxtail soup (my fav)

734 Quality has gone down hill. Last three times I have visited, I noticed that Soup stock is water down and did not have that rich beef flavor as before and the kimchi has also changed. 

I don't know if there was a change of ownership or change in cooks, but definitely their quality has gone downhill!!!

735 If you want to try something different and you are daring, go to E-Jo's.   It is very Korean.   The cooked beef soup was great, but we did order the mixed meat soup which included parts of beef I did not care for (tripe, etc. etc. etc.)   So if you are not that adventurous, just get the beef.   Also, the other Korean dishes are great.   If you go, helpful to have a Korean with you or you can ask the waiter/waitress more info.   WARNING: traditional Korean.   So do not expect the grills.

736 Vegas heat calms down and Autumn is crawling on us...
Soup from E-Jo Korean Restaurant sounds perfect.

We ordered Beef Brisket Soup and Dumpling Soup with Rice Cake. As soon as we ordered, our waitress brought out the following:  Kimchi, Kkadugi, Ssamjang, fresh green peppers, sliced scallions, and dipping sauce for the Beef of the the Beef Brisket Soup.  Our waitress explained we don't need much Banchan (you typically get whole table for in Korean restaurants) because the few items she brought will elevate the flavor of their soups. Their Kimchi and Kkadugi is excellent and made in house...you can taste the authentic flavor--a very good thing.

E-Jo Korean Restaurant takes great pride in their broth. The flavor is rich and deep from simmering the base for a long, long, long time just like Korean tradition will teach. Simply add salt, pepper, dadaegi, and scallion to taste and enjoy. 

Come and grab a bowl of soup to enrich your soul...or at least your Autumn appetite.

737 Absolutely amazing little gem. It's very authentic so be cautious if you're sensitive to spicy food. The spicy chicken was delicious and the staff was very attentive and engaging. Don't be afraid to ask questions if the menu seems a little daunting. Definitely advise people to give this place a try.

738 Today, I finally fulfilled my desire to stop by this place and give it a try.  I ordered the oxtail soup and the spicy pork plate.  Oxtail soup had a bunch of oxtail - they were definitely not stingy with the meat.  The broth is purposefully made without any sodium, so you can control how much you put in with the table salt provided.  Spicy Pork was sweet and spicy, just how I like it!  Definitely way above the quality of KBBQ places.   Their in-house fermented kimchi was bomb, too! It was not soggy at all, but pretty fresh.  Oh, and also we were given a small plate of whole green peppers, along with some (bean/chili paste mixture?) sauce for dipping, and it was great.  I don't know what they were but I was scarfing them down like they were french fries. The cute older woman working there was very nice and helpful. I am definitely coming back to try more of their soups.

739 I will start by saying that I love almost all Asian cuisines, however Korean food is usually at the bottom of the list. Given that, I do not have a lot of experience with Korean restaurants however I have been to this place several times and have enjoyed every experience. It is a small restaurant and the staff is very attentive and pleasant. I only get the chicken bulgogi when I come here ( I do not eat beef or pork) and every time it is spot on! I love heir kimchi which they cut for you table side as well. My friend had a noodle soup, that she enjoyed for the most part. If you do order the noodle soups they bring every topping and sauce imaginable to season it with.   If your looking for a good locals hole in the wall Korean place, then you have found your spot!

740 This restaurant is not on Spring Mountain in midst of Korean bbq restaurants that serves menu broadness that challenges range of cheese cake factory. 

This restaurant specializes in soup that has bone broth as base. I personally love to see restaurant that specializes in certain cuisine and take pride in it. So that was a plus for me. 

Nothing fancy, but food they serve is what I would expect to get from country side of Korea. Soup has deep taste that comes from hours of preparation. Not too many side dishes just two kinds of kimchi which is the norm for Korean restaurants that serves sullungtang. I wasn't a fan of their bulgogi, as I found their meet a little too tough. 

However their soup is something I would definitely go back for. Anytime you see older Korean men eating in a restaurant, you know what they're selling is going to be good. ;) 

I wouldn't say this place is spotless clean but based on food they serve solely, I give four stars. This is not a place you want to take for people who want modern, clean, westernized Asian food.

742 How to write this review is very tough for me.  I want to give it 5 stars because the bone soup is really good and the broth is so simple and good.  I have to agree with all the other reviews when they say it has the best Kimchi and Radish in Las Vegas...its really good.  I have been here several times but my last visit has made me skeptical of the Kimchi and Radish...which is why i can't give it 5 stars..are you ready?.......

We usually finish the kimchi and radish, but this last time we had leftovers and didn't want it to go to waste, so i ask for a to go box.  the waitress informed me that you can't take the kimchi and radish home....(okay since i already removed it from the bowl it comes in why would they care if i take it home unless.....they reuse the kim chi and radish from other customers...this is gross!!!!!).

I questioned why i couldn't take it and another waitress came over and said I could take it this time but not ever again owner policy....I asked why?  Do you reuse it?  she said...oh no! we keep it for the employees....yeah....sure.  

Though i dont know  for sure thats what they do with the kimchi and radish i can only assume that would be the reason and that has me questioning whether to back now.  Why make it so obvious over such a small amount of kimchi and radish too.  i wasnt taking the bowl full of it.

743 Went here @ night and ordered the famous soup and the bulgogi, the soup was just meh, so bland like no seasoning whatsoever, however, the bulgogi was on point. 
The Kim chi that they serve as banchan was really good however, they bring a pot of it to your table and cut them up for you.
Now, the service leave more for desired, we tried to get the bill/pay for the food for 45 mins and they totally ignored us, even tho she saw us wave at her.... and they never gave us more water or anything. 

+1 star for the bulgogi and +1 for Kim chi
-5 stars for the services 
Will not be back

746 I probably picked the wrong items since this place seems to be known for their traditional Korean soup.  I was disappointed in the lack of ban chan, it's pretty much kim chi and kim chi radishes.  We also ordered the cold noodles, which was pretty average to me and the kalb short ribs.  The kalbi short ribs seemed really overpriced given the portion.  Honestly, not sure if I would come here again, but if we do we'll come in the winter and try the hot soup.

747 I'm new to Las Vegas and eating my way around Korean restaurants to find my go to.

This place specializes is Korean soups. I had their hangover soup and it was delicious! Thus far the best kimchee I've eaten in Vegas.

The restaurant is located in a shady part of town and is not fancy. 

The service was pleasant and prompt.

I'm looking forward to dining there again to try out the other soups.

751 So I am. Big fan of authenticity:: the soup has really no flavor til you add things to it:: such as salt, kimchi, and a ton of green onions.. 
Also, the portion for what you pay: ex. Ox Tail Soup is $15.99 :: was expensive in my opinion.. And is super small:: not very filling so I recommend getting a extra side order of something so the cost is around$30.00 per person:: for that price I can get a all you can eat some where.. I recommend coming here for a Korean experience... But worth it..  ??.. Depends on the person:: I would open a spot up with the same soup:: offer bigger portions with less price and home made kimchi and probably would put this place out of business... Sorry but true..

752 This place has the most authentic gomtang (milky) soup in Las Vegas. Not to mention they have the best kimchi and pickled radish here too! 

I always order the oxtail soup and the meat is always tender. Of course put some sea salt in your soup to flavor it!

753 The restaurant is a small place located in a questionable part of the city but the food is excellent. Their meat is well marinated and their soup are the bomb. They have reasonable prices. They were a little slow on their service but considering our big party, 22 people, I'm not surprised they were overwhelmed. They were very good and personable. I would recommend this place to anyone and will come back when I'm in Vegas.

754 Very excellent value!  We ordered the gangnam set for two people and the three of us could not finish. But better yet the six marinated meats inclusion filet mignonette and prime were especially excellent. Comes with bibimbap topped with bulgogie. 

Only little thing was some of the marinade and bibimbap were a little in the sweet side. 

Highly recommended

I will be visiting this place again the next time I go to LV.

769 Not fancy, but it doesn't have to be - the food here is solid.

This is a small little Korean place on E Sahara.  It's not exactly fancy inside - don't expect fine dining.  That said, service is incredibly polite and fast, so it feels very welcoming.

I stopped in here for a quick lunch and was remarkably surprised.  The bulgogi was remarkably well-made, but the banchan were even better - the kimchi was definitely a stand-out.  Everything was remarkably fresh and bursting with flavor.  Definitely filling.

770 This was my first attempt at eating anything Korean style. I went with a friend for lunch during the week. First off, I tried to park close , so that I won't get my car stolen (a legitimate fear for the time, as a friend of mine got something stolen out of their car in one of the casino parking garages the day before). 
I didn't realize that it was pretty much soups only, but I dove right in and ordered the 'everything' soup, and my friend had the #1. The server brought out interesting tasting tea (I realize now that its iced barley, but I enjoyed it) as well as kimchi. I asked her about the white chunky kimchi, because I've had the cabbage kind before. It is radish kimchi; they both were very tasty. 
When our soups came out, they tasted bland, so I put alot of salt, green onions, and chili into it, and it was delicious. I loved the oxtail as well as the broth- it was very substantial. All of the meat in the soup was good, and dipping it into the sauce provided helped the flavor of the more blander cuts. Over all a delicious experience for my first time, I don't have anything to compare it to and that is why I gave 4 not 5.

771 One word, Kimchi.  Gomtang is good. Scallions, salt, red pepper paste, and the bowl of rice into the gomtang they go.  Take a spoonful into your mouth.  Now, top it off with the kimchi of your choice, radish or cabbage and that spoonful of the gomtang turns into something you'll want to taste in your mouth every time you are in LV.  Yup, the star of this restaurant is the kimchi.  I love my mom but I'll take E Jo's kimchi over hers any day.  Sorry mom.

772 If you were so lucky to grow up with a mom or dad that slaved over a stove all day to feed you soup that always comforted you, this is the place to replicate that exact feeling or see how much your parents made you miss out.

776 Absolutely love this little place! I have been here about 5 times now and every time I leave warm and satisfied! The place is pretty far from where I leave but when it's cold and I'm craving soup I will make the drive! 

The place is not big but also not tiny, I have had to wait a little bit during lunch time. Nice service, the ladies don't speak much English but enough to get you what you want, they are always nice and polite, drinks are always refilled. 

Among the many things I like about this place I love their homemade kimchi and radish! Unlike other Korean places they do not offer a variety of side dishes, they offer their homemade kimchi and radishes and raw pepper with dipping sauce. Kimchi and radishes are served in clay pot, served in big chunks they will cut half for you and leave the rest for you to cut if you want more! These are delicious!! A little saucy and sweet with a little kick! Love that they are served in big chunks!

I always get the combination soup, white broth with brisket, ox tail, tendon, honeycomb, and intestine! Such a good soup, plenty of meat and noodles, you can add more scallion if you want and add salt yourself. Soup always served boiling hot and tastes amazing! Their hangover soup is also really good! I prefer the combination for the variety of meats. 

It's about $16 for a soup which can be a little expensive, but it does come with rice and homemade veggies, and for the taste I do not mind the price. 

I will eat this soup in the summer... it's that good!

780 This place was not great as I expected looking at the reviews here.
1. The food is extremely expensive. Gomtang at LA usually goes for about 7$ and here it's $10. 
2. Customer service is horrible. We ordered a korean pancake and they said they ran out when we came here for breakfast. And they didn't provide anything to make up for it. 
3. We have a little baby in the family and asked if we could just have a small bowl of soup for her because she wasn't hungry to eat a lot. They said they can't give it for free and it costs half price of the adult bowl. At LA they always give a little to babies just for service. And when they gave it, it came with no meat. Just soup for like 5 bucks. 
4. The gontang soup tastes just okay. The soup is a little clear and it's because they use a lot of water and I can taste the msg in it. I'm gonna be super thirsty later. 
5. The one star only goes for the kkak doo gee (Korean kimchi radish) and the kimchee but I would not come again. 
Even after the horrible service, they still charged us for the little soup. 

This just shows that they want money and don't care about their customers because they have no competition. They're the only Korean restaurant around. Come if you're in Vegas and miss Korean food but this I'm so tired but I have to goto practice):made my family leave Vegas in a horrible mood.

781 If you are in the mood for some great Kimchi and tasty soup then you are in luck, because this little restaurant offers both.

My wife had the dumpling soup and also enjoyed her dish. We will definitely be back!

783 HOLY SHIT this is coming from someone who has consumed all types of Korean soups and BBQ in ktown LA. This is one of the best places to get authentic gomtang. The radish is hella ripe and recently I've learned that cutting those babies into bite size pieces was an inherent talent for a chinese chick like me. They also give amazing sauce for your meat and fresh green pepper with spicy paste to dip me. Best hangover or Hangryness remedy must come if you're craving Korean soup.

784 Heard this place is fabulous. Well, to me, it's not very attractive at all. Food is good but the service is horrible.
The lady who attended us was very strict about table arrangement - we're 12 total but not allowed to put tables together and sit altogether. No point insisting that while there is only couple more groups of people eating.
The waitress was really not friendly and the whole experience was so far from being pleasant.
Don't want to come back nor recommend.

I ordered the cold noodles and gom tang.  It was incredible.  There were so many side dishes.  Just to let you know that it wasn't because of the hang over, I went back 8 hours later and ate it again for dinner and it was still unbelievable.  Good service great prices.

I ordered bulgogi and the plate size serving was big enough for me to finish with a side bowl of rice. The space had big pictures of the noodle bowls being displayed on the left wall since the menu had no pictures of the food on it. The TV showed the Korean news and my group was the last ones to leave this spot.

792 Extremely Authentic, extremely fresh.

I originally gave this place 3 stars, but it really does deserve 4 or higher, I can't punish the establishment simply because Korean is a little outside my comfort zone.

The atmosphere is simple and homey. The restaurant is a few miles from the strip in what looks to be a questionable part of town, though I have no idea what the area is REALLY like. 

The employees are very sweet and very kind. Like I said, this place is extremely authentic so expect communication to be a little difficult. However, you can tell they are used to having English speaking customers and are happy to assist you. 

The food is, like I said, a little outside my comfort zone. The buckwheat noodles were delicious, but very difficult to get out of the bowl and even more difficult to bite through. All the beef we tasted was tender and delicious, absolutely no complaints. 

I would go back in a heart beat, I would just do a little more research on what types of Korean food I'd like to try first.

794 service: 5
promptness: 5
food: 4.5
kimchi: 5

I had #1from the menu and it came out just as I imagined. The server explained thoroughly and I discovered that the soup was not salted. Horay!!! I am on low sodium diet and I was able to enjoy the soup without adding salt.
I gave 4.5 on food because broth was a bit thinner than I expected.
Kimchis were the best I've tasted so far from restaurants. They were on a bit sweeter side but just right for soup.
I LOVED their simplicity yet the quality.
Definitely visit again!!!

798 Best Korean gookbob restaurant in town.  If you are familiar with gookbob style, a combination of soup and rice, you should love it.  This restaurant is not for typical Korean barbeque, so dont expect to have a BBQ party here.  Anyway, you can give it a try-!

799 Very good Korean food. Decided to go a little off strip for food which is how I found E Jo.  The spicy pork was exactly what I was looking for.  Probably could have been a little spicier however not gonna not-pick to much.  Got a bottle of the peach soju as well.  Wish they had other flavors available which was a bummer.  Overall a good place to get food if ya looking for something not pricy like what could be seen on the strip.

803 Very disappointed! We have been coming here every time we visit Vegas and we loved it. But today our soups were total water down and our pork Bulgogi was half of the previous portion. There were 20-30 people waiting due to the Labor Day weekend but still my parents and I think they can do better.

804 Maybe I am just not used to this type of Korean, but I just feel my experience fell short. They pretty much just have soup here. I only got about three small slices of beef in my soup. I didn't think the soup was anything to rave about, I have had much better. Staff was friendly but this just isn't a place I think I would go back too.

805 Went to check out more Korean Restaurants here in LV. Saw that this place had great reviews so we decided to check this place out. Let's start with ambience, it's not for date night..its just an average mom and pop looking restaurant. Service was not the best. The waitress was grumpy and looked like something was on her mind...maybe it was one of those days but hey don't show it to your customers. Overpriced items on the menu. Definitely not worth the price for the amount you get. The soup was bland. I understand there's all the condiments that you can flavor with but mann the broth needed help! I was soo disappointed... I even put a lot to flavor the soup but it still lacked in flavor.. But I'm happy we ordered the beed stir fry it was really good.

810 When your friend invites you to go out and eat was my way of discovering this place. We entered and our host automatically greeted and seated us. I looked through the menu and noticed there was no vegetarian options. My waitress was very understanding that I wanted the cold buckwheat noodle with no meat. Before our order came we were given bowls of seasoning and appetizing kimchi & daikon. The lady was nice enough to cut our kimchi and advised me about cutting my noodles with the scisscors provided. My noodles were delicious and the sesame seeds complimented the chili flavor.

814 I just arrived from LA and was eating here with my family. To be honest, everything was enjoyable from side dishes to soup. However, the quality of rice was very disappointing. It wasn't mushy or too dry but I just couldn't keep eating it even with the soup. I'm a big rice fan so rice is an essential dining experience for me. 

All Korean restaurant is more expensive than in LA.

With the amount of money we pay to eat here or just costumers in general, hope you guys serve better rice in future!

817 We were traveling from San Diego for business and got tired of the overpriced hotel food with mediocre service and found this place on Yelp. Not a fancy decor but simple and clean. This is the real deal Korean restaurant. Attentive, friendly and swift service. 
Great free appetizer snacks. This place specializes in soups but I choose the spicy chicken entree and my wife the stir fried ribeye and both was delicious and good size portions. This will be a staple for us whenever we're return to Vegas again. Can't wait to try other dishes here.

818 3 1/2 stars.

We came here because my gf's, and myself included were pretty hungover. Especially the birthday girl (mission completed)! hahaha.. She mentioned she came here last time and that it was pretty good. I wanted Earl of Sandwich instead but b-day girl gets what she wanted and she really needed it. 

There is a parking lot in the back. The inside is pretty big, spacious and clean. The menu is pretty simple but good selections of different dishes to choose from. They have soups/Broths, noodles, pan grilled meat dishes and a few other dishes. 

_Boiled Beef ($24.99 medium) This is an appetizer but also can be eaten as extra meat when you order your Brisket Beef soup as the meat is similar. The boiled beef comes in very thin slices. Pretty lean and oil free, which is why I liked this. A bit bland is taste so they give a sweet sauce on the side to dip it. I recommend getting this to share when waiting for your food.
_Brisket Beef Soup ($10.99) This is a staple dish here and seems to be pretty popular.. Seolleongtang is a Korean broth made from ox bones, briskets and other cuts. The seasoning is usually made at the table as it comes very bland. You add your own amount of salt and pepper and chopped spring onions. As everyone as their own level of saltiness and spice. It can be made very clean and clear or milky and a slight thick white cloud color. I've had many great ones in Koreatown in LA. so can't say this is the best or close to it but for Vegas it is pretty good. The beef was good, wish they added a bit more, and I liked the noodles. The broth was clean, not too salty or heavy. Always comes with a bowl of rice, some like to add it all in the soup, I like to eat it on the side so I can control how much rice I eat. 

The sides they serve are Kimchi and Kkakdugi (a variety of kimchi in Korean cuisine. Usually, it has all the ingredients of kimchi, but the baechu (Napa cabbage) used for kimchi is replaced with Korean daikon). When a restaurant is known for mainly soups you don't get much side dishes because all you really need is kimchi. They also serve gochu (Korean green chili pepper) and a side of red chili paste. The gochu is not spicy so do not worry. It was a bit mild yet crisp and refreshing. 

The food was good, the only reason I did not give 4 stars and gave it 3 (but round up to 3 1/2 stars) was the service. Our waitress was not polite and was pretty stand off ish. You can tell she did not want to be there and I get it, I been there done that, but you are still working and in the field of customer service. It's not like we were being rude or difficult. The inside was pretty empty and it took us about 30 min to get our food! She did not come by to give us a heads up or even give our appetizer which we asked for, and she said it was coming soon but it never did. Even the customers who came after us got their meals 12 min in or so. I don't know if it's because we were real hungry but when I checked yelp on my check in time, yup it was 30 minutes. A little smile can go a long way.

819 I have to come to Vegas for work and everytime I am reminded of korean comfort food, my group and I make the trip out here. It's not comparable to Korean food in LA for price and taste but it's good enough. Best radish kimchi in the entire Vegas area! That seals the deal for me, personally. It's quick & easy and that's good enough for me!

821 I have been craving for Korean Oxtail Soup since I arrived in Las Vegas last Friday. I tried last night but this restaurant closes at 9pm Saturdays. After church today, this is my only destination. My family of 5 ordered 2 Oxtail Soup and 3 Ox Tounge but had to order extra ox tounge because they are all so good and delicious. I love the extras on the side such as Kimchi, spices and sauces so I can customize the soup to my own taste. Service was friendly and fast. A new favorite place in Vegas so will definitely come back and will being along friends and family.

825 Spiciest and freshest kimchee and radish kimchee I have had outside of South Korea (including LA, NY, Vegas, Seattle,  Orange County, Fort Lee NJ, the northeast, Midwest, and Hawaii.  Other restaurants tend to have kimchee on the milder and sweeter side. The kimchee is so spicy, that it does a better job at draining my nasal passages during the allergy season than taking oral and nasal antihistamines and decongestants combined

As tpu can guess, my wife and I come here especially for the kimchee.  Usually have the Gom Tang beef brisket soup.  Not much in menu selection or banchan side dishes, but what they do have is very good and authentic Korean.  Lots of Korean patrons, a fair indication of how good and authentic the Korean food is.  Decent parking.  Usually crowded when we come either on the weekdays or weekends.  Wish LA had this type of kimchee.  If they sold it, I would buy some.and bring back to LA.  Restaurants and supermarkets in LA, don't have kimchee as good as this place.  BCD Tofu house's kimchee doesn't even compare to the kimchee at this place.

826 Delicious.  We always have the beef brisket soup and kalbi.  We love it.  The sides (ban chan) are always kimchi, radish kimchi and peppers (that you dip in spicy soy bean paste).  But this is really all you need for the beef brisket soup.  Traditional.  The side dishes are very good as well...but you cut yourself...which a lot of Koreans love this style.  Kalbi was very good as well...actually my daughters favorite here.  
The soup is just nice on cold day or as a hangover cure. 
The soups btw are bland...but traditionally the soup is served with salt, green onions and red pepper flakes for you to season yourself.

827 Forget the buffets. I come here every time I'm in Vegas. It's ultimate Korean comfort food and SO PERFECT for when I'm hungover (cough... I mean... sick). Very traditional Korean fare, please do everyone a favor and don't get the BBQ (hubs likes it okay but its not great), just stick to what they do best - the SOUP. (and the kimchi, but that's free)

828 Shout out to my Yelp friend Michael K for doing a last second UYE for this place.

With that said, I have never been here. The Korean restaurants im used to are the cook it yourself all you can eat table top grill kinds. So I was curious as to how this place works.

From looking at the menu it looks simple enough. Everything has a number and is in Korean and English. Since I didn't really want to be that adventurous, I chose the #1 Beef Brisket Soup. It's your basic soup with Beef Brisket and Noodles. 

Now this is where I learned something new. You season the soup yourself meaning they don't put any spices whatsoever in it. On every table there are containers of salt with a mini spoon. For those that are looking for a low to no sodium meal, this is your soup to get! What I ended up doing was grabbing the meat from my soup and eating it with the steamed rice they give you. I would also mix in a little bit of the hot sauce and curry sauce that was provided as well as mild green peppers. 

What actually stole the show was the Kimchi. I have had it before but when I had some of theirs, it tasted really fresh. What I find out was that they make it themselves from scratch. That explains why it was so good. Definitely not from a jar you would be able to buy at Seafood City or Ranch Market.

Service was good. We had a sweet old lady that looked like she would not be able to understand us or speak English well. I was pleasantly surprised when she spoke perfectly good English to us. She was very helpful in answering any questions we threw at her.

As for the place and overall location, I gotta admit, I drive by this place all the time and never really noticed it. Shame on me. But then again, it is in a weird part of the east side of Sahara when most of the food places are on the west side. When you go inside, there are plenty of tables and chairs I would say for about 20 people.

So next time, based on the pics, the Spicy Pork and Spicy Chicken looks really promising.

829 Sometimes it's nice to get away from all that fancy shmancy stuff you find on the strip and enjoy what food is really all about and that is good old hearty home cooking.  E-jo has some of the most delicious and authentic kimchi I have ever had and some pretty good (although not the best) sullungtang.  Its good enough to satisfy any hangover or asian soup craving.  The service is wonderful here and the place feels nice and cozy :)

831 We came here on a Tuesday night and ordered 
1. 2 Brisket beef soup, 9.99ea
2. Spicy chicken,15 
3. Rib-Eye, 15
for 63

- The best Kim Chi and Raddish in Las Vegas. Hands Down. Bold Statement. The last time I had Banchan like this was when we ate at Yong SuSan where we basically paid $100 for banchan. HAHA. 
- I knew right away that this was comparable to SoCal Korean food when we entered the restaurant with the waitress welcoming us in her native tongue and they had a Korean TV show on! Perfect! :)
- Friendly service. We got our food fast. Was served both hot and cold tea. She even small talked with the little English she knew. 
- Brisket beef soup was a bit bland for my liking, but was filled with a lot of brisket. I added most of the chili paste in the soup and always dunked my beef in the sauce! Sauce was good. Had a wasabi-like taste. Yum!
- Spicy chicken and rib-eye was exceptional! If I had to chose, I thought the spicy chicken was a bit better. Great flavoring. Lots of grilled onions. 
- Shhhh...She was so nice that she said it was okay that we can take some of the kim chi home.
- Definitely a gem since it's off the Spring Mountain strip! Love this place.

833 This is THE BEST place to dine if you partied hard on the strip and are craving korean food the next day.  Made with quality ingredients you can taste- their salgogi gomtang is amazing!! Their Kimchi and Ggakdugi is also on point! Want Kbbq? They can grill LA galbi in the kitchen and bring it out to you.  Their potato pancakes are also delicious.  Honestly, you can just choose anything on the menu and it wouldn't disappoint.  My family has been coming here for over 10 years, it's that amazing.  They can get a little busy during peak hours, but again, it's worth the wait.

834 So sad they closed the other location on Spring Mt. & Jones due to lack of business (barely anyone noticed it was there in the 168 Market shopping center).  Their Oxtail soup is perfect for wintertime when you need an alternative to ramen or pho.  I wished they had their steamed manduus like their closed location.  That was one of my favorite dishes from there.  Loved their homemade, pickled kimichi and kakdogi (radishes).

835 Best Kimchi in Vegas.  Easily.  5 Star Kimchi.

The rest of the food was fantastic also, particularly if you like traditional Korean.  

You can also get the Kimchi togo, which I suggest.  I cooked three meals at home with it and they were delicious.  

I will definitely be back.

840 This place really smelled authentic and had some very interesting cuisine. I'm used to having many side dishes come out before the meal but this place only had spicy cabbage and radish as sides- very spicy and my friends really enjoyed it. I couldn't handle it- lol

We ordered Bulgogi beef, spicy chicken and spicy pork. We all really enjoyed the pork and chicken so much  that I forgot to take a pic of the dishes- darn it! 

This place is really authentic so I'm sure you'll need to either have the right palate or learn to try different options, as it's an acquired taste. I don't care much for spicy but I sure devoured the chicken and pork really fast- yummy yummy yummy! 

Foodies, this place is great! You'll need to try it for sure.

My aunt works in the kitchen for a large Korean Market in Tacoma, WA. my uncle and dad have been to many traditional soup places all over large korean towns while doing construction work. We all agreed that there food is on par with anywhere in the states, especially their hangover soup. 
Their kimchi was on point as well, and the servers were really nice.

843 Unfortunately Not as good as we expected with the high stars that it got.We are not Korean so we may have different taste. We ordered Oxtail soup and beef brisket soup,but taste was so bland. It's just hot water, nothing taste of Beef broth. What is this?!?! So added in lots of Korean miso and some other sauce, but we still couldn't eat. However Kimchi was so delicious. Waitress was nice and friendly. The price is higher than some other Korean restaurant in LV. Unfortunately we are not going back there again.

845 2nd place we went while in Vegas, my dad must get his Korean fix at least 2x while traveling.  That being said, prices were reasonable, food quality was great.  Small little place, but kimchee was great too.  The squared spicy radishes (Cqack Doo Gee) was not fermented enough for me.  The Nem Myung (Cold Noodle Soup) my brother order was a good broth, not necessarily the best, but was tasty.  Got the Gahl Bee for the kids, they loved it, old school standard style cut the long way.  NICE!  I got the Sul Lung Tang (Beef Brisket Soup), great for the hang over, excellent.  All in all, great place.  Can't give 5 stars and those are restricted for innovative / SUPER excellent Korean food.  Sorry, gots to be picky for those.

They specialize in soup dishes and good for hangover and quick breakfast.  I like both kimchee and the service was very good.

849 ***!!!!!***WARNING TO ALL WHO WON'T/CAN'T EAT BLOOD***!!!***!!!**
This is a great restaurant, my friends and I were all very happy with everything EXCEPT one thing. HANGOVER SOUP!!! It tastes great, however it contains large chunks of jellied Ox Blood. I ordered it not knowing what was in it. It highly offensive to me to eat blood as I see that it violates bible commands at Deuteronomy 12:23 and Acts 15:20,29. Other than that I loved the KimChee, the radishes are amazing. Literally the best Kimchee I've ever had. The restaurant has a very authentic feel and the workers are all Korean and there is even Korean TV playing in the dining room. I only can wish that they would have had a warning about the Blood as I had no idea when I ordered. (didn't find out until I had eaten half of it!)...I did of course inform the waitress about the need to have it disclosed on the menu and she seemed very accommodating.

854 For the price, this place is not a great value. The service was wonderful and the kimchi is indeed the best in town. BUT the soups are not outstanding. I was planning to order yuk gae jang but they did not have it, so instead the woman recommended the spicy cabbage soup. My boyfriend ordered the oxtail soup and he did enjoy that. 

Overall, the atmosphere is nice and the soups are OK, highlight is really the kimchi but for the price I prefer getting my korean bbq.

855 Go for the food.  If you expect good ambience you will be disappointed.  It's a small restaurant and can get crowded so get there early or you will probably wait outside in line.  Food is good but don't expect it to be great like the ones in OC (CA) or LA.

857 I have been here so many times already and every time it has been good. They mainly concentrate on the soup and they are good with what they are good at, soup. I would imagine that this is just like comfort food you would find in Korea. Besides the soup, their kimchi is so fresh and tasty. I think they are home made. I recommend this place for great comfort soup if you simply only want soup.

Better than any Gom-Tung in Los Angeles.  Price might be slightly higher than L.A. but it's Vegas...
I would rather eat here than any Korean Restaurant on the Strip...except Ginseng Restaurant has this Kal-Bi Hae Jung Kook that is really good...
I would always recommend this place...
Not a whole lot of people know about this place because it's a small family owned restaurant outside of the Steip.

859 They have really good Gomtang here which is just oxtail soup with brisket meat. Its really similar to Sullungtang but they are different because the way each dish is prepared is different.

I come here when I crave Korean food after some drinking in Vegas. Its really good food at decent price. Though I would prefer Hanbat any day over this place, this restaurant definitely has good food and it does taste awesome. My gomtang was a good portion but the meat in the soup was very thin and little. It was so thin that when I grabbed it, it easily ripped. I wish they would give us larger portion of meat that are cut in thick pieces.

Their kimchi and radish kimchi is also good and you can always get more if you ask! The ladies working here are super super friendly and nice and theyre always greeting you in and out with a smile on their faces.

I highly recommend to those who likes the traditional Korean beef soup.

860 Decent place with decent food...

Price is good compare to other Korean places on main strip...

Fresh green pepper was really nice to have....

I would definitely come back here for another try when I visit Vegas...

861 As much as I travel around the United States, it's really hard to find good Korean food outside of
Los Angeles.  Thank goodness Vegas had some decent stuff.  Saved my life!  I had some suh lung tang in the morning that was so warming to my stomach.  If you're hungover and craving some hot Korean soup, this is the spot.  Great service!

862 This place is a hidden gem. Growing up in LA meant I was exposed to decent-to-very good Korean food, but this restaurant serves food that is probably better than LA koreatown. The location isn't the most ideal, but the owner is super friendly and food is served fresh at high quality.
I'll definitely return.

864 Wife wanted Korean bone soup. Haven't had it in a long time as we can't find it in San Francisco. Looks really authentic. We aren't Korean but we lived in a Korean neighborhood before so Korean soup is like comfort food for the wife. Down to earth restaurant where they play Korean videos on their tv. No subtitles. Have no clue what is showing. Ha Ji Ma!

868 This place had good reviews so I thought I'd check it out. If you are looking for a place that specializes in soups, this is your place. Their menu is minimal with some traditional dishes. Its very old school Korean and this place is not for the novice. 
Staff is friendly and tables are laid out smartly for a small space.

870 This place is in a sketchy area of vegas but worth the drive!  I took my son and we thought this was one of the most authentic korean places in town!  The kimchi was house made and the best he has ever had.  Our waitress noticed he loved it so much she gave him a small cup to take home.  I love that there is no salt in the soup and they give you a bowl of salt and chili to adjust the flavors.  They only give radishes, kimchi and some really delicious chilis as your sides.  I had the tripe soup and my son had the brisket.  The only thing i felt they could have done better was put more tripe in my soup.  Their portions are small.  But the soup was delicious!!  We will go back.  They should sell their kimchi on the side!

874 coming from Koreatown LA, we have excellent Korean beef noodle soup restaurants. if E-jo were in ktown, it would hold its own. 

the broth was excellent - clean and perfect beefy heartiness. somewhere in between the hanbat's milky thicker beefiness and the light clear broth at young dong if you're familiar with the two in ktown. I got the doh gah nee (ox knee) tang, and the beef and cartilage was a good firmness - not overly fatty like it can be at other beef noodle restaurants. 

also tried a bit of my friends kkori (ox tail) meat, with the bone sawed to smaller, more easily handled pieces.  

Kimchi was solid and service was efficient. definitely a must for a hangover cure in Vegas. Eggcelent. Will be back.

875 After being surrounded with tons of tourist spots and food choices, we wanted soup...chaldobaegi gom tang hit the spot.  

This place has a homemade taste in all dishes even down to the handtorn beef and the insisting on cutting the kimchi for us first. Such good kimchi.  Splitting a soup is fine, be sure to ask for a bowl on the side and add salt, kim chi juices, and plenty of green onions while it's bubbly. 

Parking lot out back is so quiet, try to park closest to the street.   Also the service is so attentive and kind.

Next time,  definitely going for haejangguk, since that looked popular here too :)


P.s. speak Korean for amazing service!

878 My friend took me here for some good home-some Korean food. The Sulongtang soup was very good, and even better than some of the places in Korea Town in LA. 

Their Banchan was also excellent, especially their kimchee which is made by them. They bring it in a separate black bowl and it's easy to share if you're a germaphobe lol. I will be a regular here whenever I want to down to earth Korean food.

879 We ate here 3 times in 4 days. Kimchi is the best I have tasted in a while. I've seen some complaints about prices.. I don't think people understand what it takes to make korean food. We have made some of these soups, they are very time consuming!  It's very fair price for what you get. Come here for the food, there is not much of anything else. It's in a sketchy neighborhood,  restaurant has bars and there is absolutely no atmosphere! Lol and if you are white, you might be the only one. Seriously,  come try it out you'll love it if you like kimchi and korean bone soups.

880 This is one of my favorite Korean restaurant in Las Vegas!  In KTown (LA) there is a famous boiled bone stew (soup), this place is probably a close 2nd.   Their kim chi is amazing I'd rather buy it here than get the ones from the market.  Service is always friendly, fast and kind of makes me forget I'm in Vegas.

883 Hearty, hot Korean soup is perfection during this chilly December weather! 

I've heard about E-Jo through friends and fellow yelpers and decided to go last night with a coworker. We both got sizzling hot soups (Gomtang - brisket for me, oxtail for my coworker) and we split spicy buckwheat noodles (Bibimnaengmyun - cold noodles topped with spicy sauce, veggies, and boiled egg)

When I first got the soup, it looked fantastic and I had to dig in. I tasted it and my reaction showed how bland it was. My coworker pointed out the small bowl of salt crystals right in front of us (silly me for missing) that is supposed to be used to add salt to taste. That made a lot more sense to me and I added a small spoonful along with a sprinkle of pepper... My soup was DELISH!

The Kimchi and Kkakdugi (radish) were both very tasty and servers were quick to replenish. A large portion came in small ceramic bowls and you serve and cut them yourself - just like how they do it in soup restaurants in South Korea. We also had spicy Korean peppers to dip in Doenjang (miso paste) which is one of my favorite simple Korean sides.

The Bibimnaengmyun wasn't my favorite. The sauce tasted sweet to me which is extremely strange as this cold noodle dish is supposed to be spicy, not sweet (?) My coworker added more spicy paste to it and finished it off as I only cared for one bite.

For the price, quality, and portions of food, I would absolutely recommend E-Jo. Maybe not for their Bibimnaengmyun... But it's definitely a great place for authentic Korean soup!

Their beef soup (either ox tail or brisket) was awesome.  Very wholesome soup and tender beef.  Comfort food at very reasonable price.  Don't expect lot of banchan as you should only expect to see tasty kimchi and not much else.  If you are looking for Korean restaurant with variety of banchan, this place may not be for you.  If you are visiting LV like us and take Monorail, you need to go to SLS station.  We walked from the station  but it was further they anticipated :(.  So Lyft ride saved us on our way back to the station :).  Oh we were just enjoying the food and so I forgot to take picture til the end and left you only few pieces of moo (radish kimch)...

887 The hubs came here with his friends when they were in LV for a bachelor party weekend and said that the sullong tang is very good. So when we went to LV with my parents, he brought them here for some much-needed Korean food (for them, not us). 

The food was all great, and my parents were very happy, but the winner was actually the kimchi that is served at every table. They bring out two small clay pots - one with cabbage kimchi and the other with raddish kimchi. On the day of our visit, the cabbage kimchi was bleh, but the raddish kimchi was definitely a winner. We finished everything in the clay pot and asked for more! 

The next time I'm in LV and craving Korean food, I'll definitely go back to E-Jo for a fix!

There were no 'extra' service except keep pouring water.
Waitress asked for $10 more tip.

I said isn't it up to the customer?
And she goes yeah but... please give us $10 more.
Very very unsatisfied. Will never come again.

889 Hidden gem in Las Vegas.  Very homey, cozy place.  Homestyle cooking.  Great soups.  Especially their hangover soups.  They are just what the doctor ordered after a big night of drinking.  Delicious house made kimchi.  Best restaurant kimchi I've had anywhere.

890 PSA, they will only acknowledge you if you are Korean!!! We came here on a rather slow Monday afternoon. There were only 3 small parties already seated in the restaurant prior to us getting there. One lady saw us standing  near the door and told us to sit anywhere. And that was the last time anyone made eye contact with us.

A waitress kept serving the table right next to us and never welcomed us, nor gave us a menu or waters. Mind you we waited patiently for 30 minutes for some type of acknowledgement. She even started cleaning off a table as she continued to ignore us. Needless to say we will never return to this restaurant.

893 This place is as simple satisfaction as you can go. You can always tell a good Korean place by the older Koreans that seek it out.
There's regularly a line out the door, but people are in and out so regularly. Don't expect to be able to sit and talk too long after finishing your food because if there's a line they will strongly suggest you to leave by bringing the check.
The food is nice and simple. Different types of meat options in beef broth. Comes out piping hot, and good kkakdoogi (daikon radish kimchi). It's good comfort food, and especially good when you're sick.

896 It's been 6 years since our first visit to E-Jo and we've eaten there over a dozen times -- usually when we first get to town after driving from Phoenix.  Before we even check in at our hotel.  We still love it.  A comforting bowl of bubbling soup or stew.  It was the perfect place to bring visiting Korean in-laws after the long flight from Seoul and they enjoyed the delayed immersion into glitzy Las Vegas culture.  The food isn't fancy or the menu overly long.  Korean comfort food at its best.  The price is reasonable at about $15/dish.  And it's not far off the Strip.

897 Do not come here if u are hungry. You have to be willingly able to wait for 1 1/2 hrs just for the food to come out plus an additional 20 mins to get in. There were a lot of angry customers when I went, some people had to cancel their order cause their food wouldn't come out while others were already eating. The food is honestly not even that good either, the customer service was also horrible. I advise you not to come.

899 It's like coming home! My mother is Korean and made the most amazing dishes with an eye for beautiful presentations and amazing flavors. Today I was back in Seoul. Reviewing the menu, this is not a single dollar sign pricing menu but it was still a good value. 

I had the Duc Soup. It's comfort food. Savory soup with duc, mondu, eggs, slivers of carrots and geehm. Came with sliced green onions to add. 

Side dishes were two types of kimchee, Chinese cabbage and moo kimchee (turnip). Both were fresh. The food server cut the kimchee into bite sized portions. There were two kinds of gochujong provided to dip the peppers. 

This was very good. The service was prompt and polite. I love the care they gave. I would bring my family here. 

Thank you for a wonderful lunch.

900 A true diamond in the rough when it comes to Korean food options in Las Vegas.  Korean barbeque and tofu stew joints are aplenty in Spring Mountain, but E-Jo is one of those niche restaurants that specializes in slow cooked beef soups which  one rarely comes across unless you're in a city with a full-fledged Koreatown.
  
Don't be fooled by their limited menu offerings and the simplicity of their banchan since the old saying goes that it is far better to do a few things well than to do many things poorly.  They offer a variety of beef-based broths containing a variety of cuts ranging from brisket, oxtail, and tongue to a variety of other tender bits such as tripe, tendon, and intestine.  The broth has a milky white complexion that can only be achieved from boiling down beef bones for several hours under a low simmer achieving a rich and nourishing soup perfect for a cold winter day or when one is under the weather or post-hangover.   
Sea salt and pepper are provided at the table to adjust the broth to optimum taste and along with the choice of meat, some silky threads of somyeon (wheat flour) noodles and fresh green onion complete the dish.  

Accompaniments include a refreshing glass of barley tea, a few raw green peppers (not spicy, although they look like banana peppers, presumably as a palate cleanser?), and two artisan jars containing perhaps the best made-in-house kimchi in town in the form of radish and napa cabbage cut down table side to bite-size portions by one of the staff.  For the final fine-tuning of flavors, some ground red chili paste and additional green onion are provided for the broth and a spicy soybean paste and horseradish/wasabi based soy sauce for dipping the meats.  Other options include a few choices of grilled meats, nyangmyeon, and a soup with homemade dumplings/rice cakes which have also been well-received in other reviews.

A true mom/pop joint devoid of pretense that delivers homecooked Korean goodness to nourish the body and soul.

901 This is a diamond in the rough, if you're brave and adventurous. We love beef bone broth soup as it is good for you and tastes good. Definitely an authentic Korean restaurant; they speak Korean and English. I'm not super adventurous so I just ordered the beef brisket broth whereas my husband ordered the whole mix where you get brisket, cartilage, stomach, and pretty much everything else that is edible of a cow's insides. I just don't like the texture of those inside my mouth. We also ordered sooyook which is basically thinly sliced braised beef or pork, in this case it was beef and they also served with cartilage and dipping sauce. My husband ate the cartilage and I ate the beef. I didn't care too much for the sauce but he said it was similar to a ponzu sauce. The broth soup was amazing and I drank the bowl dry. I would highly recommend this place and it's not too far from the strip.

902 Great service and good value food but the parking situation is a bit sketchy.... I'm not sure if there's more parking but my friends and I parked behind the restaurant. Not exactly a safe walk if you're dining here later in the day. 

They offer a simple menu but during the winter don't have the cold noodle soup which I had my heart set on. I ordered the number 11: cabbage soup with beef and sponge. The sponge is pork blood I believe. It IS super spongy and not the usually silky texture that I'm used to in Vietnamese dishes. I think the soup was a bit bland but nothing a little salt couldn't fix. They gave us peppers, Kim chi and radish as sides. THE BEST KIM CHI EVER. I wish they sold that stuff separately because I'd buy it by the jug but I don't think they do.... (they should!). It was crispy, fresh and not super fermented.

903 Simple and delicious. No frills, just good ol healthy Korean food eating. The ambiance of the restaurant is certainly a nice ol school Korean eatery feel and the food and service get my seal of approval for good spots for Korean food here in Las Vegas.  Soups, boiled meats, noodles, meat entree aka Korean BBQ and side drinks.

We came here three times (forgot to check in on one of the nights..) during our stay in Vegas and recommend them highly. Parking is available in the rear and their kimchi and gockdoogi comes in bowls uncut which is definitely a traditional Korean thing. Love it.  Affordable and fills you up real good and all while feeling healthy and guilt free after.


Note for non Koreans, don't be intimidated by the Korean environment, they are nice, speak English, and the menu items are described  in American (specifically North American) as well. 

Finally for those that need some help. I recommend the Korean stew.  #1 off the menu.

Don't forget to season your stew to your liking.  To help the clueless, I do about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt, pepper, 1.5 tablespoon of scallions (green onion looking things), and a 1/2 teaspoon of that red paste and it was the bomb.com

Enjoy and have a positive day.

904 Amazing Sul Lung Tung! They also have many other soup options for those who partied way too hard in Vegas...GUILTY!

Service is also great, the waitresses were all so nice and helpful. I LOVEEE how they have homemade Kimchi and it came in a little pot. Really added to the authenticity of the place. 

The portion was great and the price was also reasonable. The Oxtail soup was delicious and it definitely made me feel better after I ate it. The meat easily fell of the bone and everything was so fresh! Remember to add salt, and other small dishes in your soup to add on to the flavor. 

Will definitely be back again to try other things on the menu!

905 Annyeonghaseyo!! 

That's hello in Korean. I only know this because my BF is half Korean and he says this is the closest to mom-cooking he can get. So that alone says a lot about this mom & pop restaurant. The surrounding area is not the prettiest of places and parking is behind the building. So I suggest that you dine with someone, especially at night. The older lady that always serves us is so sweet.

Here's the run down. The menu is pretty pure and simple. For the banchan, it's kimchee and spicy radishes. But this is seriously the best kimchee ever! It's made in house and they cut it up right in front of you. They also give you peppers to snack on which aren't spicy at all. And the main reason we come here is for their beef brisket or oxtail soup. So a lot of reviews say that the broth is bland. And for lack of a better word, yes it's bland. It's made that way to enhance the flavor of the beef. There is salt, chili paste and green onions to flavor the broth to your liking. We also love the kalbi ribs. They a good amount of meat and fat. They are fall off the bone tender and so full of flavor. All dishes are served with rice so you aren't just eating straight meat. 

We really love this place for the hospitality and especially the food. So if you want that down home feel Korean cooking, this is def your place!

906 WHY DID I FEEL LIKE I FELT SOMETHING WRONG AFTER I TASTED SUL LUNG TANG IN THIS RESTAURANT?  I was there had three sul lung tang with my friends, but, the meals were not good tastes and flavors, felt very greased or added some artificial flavors after I ate, also, the side dishes, kimchi and radish- kakdooki were not fresh, I think they might a new ownership or changed the chief.  I wouldn't go that place and no recommend to my friends.

908 This place is located near back lot of Westgate, a sort of post apocalyptic area filled with abandoned and closed buildings.  But don't let that dissuade you; once you step into the tiny building you realize this place is bona fide OG korean bone soup place.  Their radish and cabbage kimvhi are to die for and their soup is so rich in bone rendering goodness, you'd think they're simmering a whole vow daily.  Try number 2 and 4, you wont regret it.  Seriously, this place is just as good as ktown in los angeles and other socal ktowns.

910 A friend and I split the spicy pork bulgogi, mung bean pancake, and beef brisket soup. Along with the kimchi, the food was very delicious! The kimchi didn't have that sour over-fermented taste.

For the beef brisket soup, I actually felt bad for it not reaching my expectations after all the hype in all the other reviews about it. Everything else was tasty and the staff were friendly, so I just felt bad for thinking it tasted bland. I was probably doing something extremely wrong though, because I read a few more reviews and apparently we should be adding things to the soup.... my bad. I guess I just need to figure out the combination of additional things to add. With all our food items, we had green chili peppers, a sauce that tasted like soy sauce mixed with wasabi, soy bean paste, and chili paste. There's also pepper and flaky looking salt (presumably MSG, at least that's what it tasted like).

Although very friendly like I said, the staff wasn't too quick about giving us our check until we asked, which was okay for us, but may annoy some people.

I'll definitely be back to redeem my soup modifying skills.

The broth is really meaty and rich the endless boiling of bones. It's served to you plain, with rice noodles and slices of oh so tender beef. You add as much salt and scallions as you wish. Simple and hearty Korean food that warms the body and soul on a cold winter's night.

We were in Vegas over the weekend and we decided to end the trip with a piping bowl of Oxtail Soup. We ordered the Beef Brisket Soup and the Combination Soup. Both were absolutely delicious! The banchans were also very good. Their homemade Kimchi and Radishes played a perfect balance with the deep rich dense flavors of the Oxtail Soup and the spicy and sweetness of the Kimchi. 

This restaurant is a must if your in Vegas.

918 E-Jo is a Korean restaurant just a few minutes off the strip that specialize in soup and boiled meat. That sounds pretty boring, but trust me it's not! I literally wanted to walk out after seeing the menu but I'm glad I stayed. Soup? That's literally half of their menu. The other half consists of five typical Korean BBQ dishes.

They have a basic beef broth soup and a hangover soup that's spicy. You choose which meats you want in the soup and this gets served with a couple sides and rice. You add your own salt and spice. I read this while waiting to order and rolled my eyes, but I ended up loving this.

They also have a meat platter you can order in small or large that has the boiled meats on them.

Lastly they have a handful of KBBQ dishes like short ribs, chicken, or bulgogi.

This place has two sides: cabbage kimchi and radish kimchi. These two items are amazing. Best kimchi in Vegas. Super flavorful-basically perfect. They also serve these mild chili's with samjeon(sp).

I never thought I'd have Korean food at 8:30am, but E-Jo changed that for me. I came to E-Jo based on their yelp reviews alone. I didn't expect a restaurant to be filled with business men at 8:30am but they actually had a waiting list on the door! At 8:30am

I do give a shout out to the staff: two servers who were just on top of things. They did everything before I could think of it. Extra napkins, always full cups, always more rice, always checking. They cut up the kimchi for us and also explained how to eat the dishes we ordered. 

E-Jo is a simple place that does a handful of things very well. Their short ribs were $24.99 and served with rice and ban Chan. Sounds steep compared to an AYCE joint but this was definitely worth the price for it's quality. The food is served very quickly and service is very prompt. The place has very limited parking and is what I would consider a whole in the wall-no frills. I definitely am going to start recommending this place as a  unique restaurant.

919 Well where do i start.  The food is very good here but that is not the issue.  The issue is service, which has happened now multiple times.  

On my second visit here, i waited more than 10 minutes just to get acknowledged to order food.  Then they forgot to serve me food.  So for about 30 minutes flagged down a couple different waitress and said where is my order.  The response i got was thats its coming.  But looking around me, people who arrived after me are all getting their soup.  I cant even remember how many times i have said something but they dont care to actually care.  Finally after i saw a couple pay for their food as they were done eating as they came in at least 10 minutes after us, i said they came in after us and they are already done eating and now paying for the food.   The lady said that they forgot about our order.  WTF......  she said they will make it immediately. 


On my 3rd visit i had to wait over 20 minutes after i sat down just to order.  Mind you its not busy in there!  It was not even half full.  Then it takes forever to get food.  

Today takes the straw.  There was only 3 tables of customers.  NOT ONE OF THE 2 WAITRESSES CAME TO TAKE MY ORDER.   Both my wife and I tried flagging one down but they just go right into the back.  

After 23 minutes waiting, we got up and left.  I have never experienced this is ANY restaurant in my life.  STAY AWAY from this place.

921 I didn't take any pictures but I ordered the hangover soup, marinated galbi rice and ssuh loong ttang, this is the  to go spot for some authentic true Korean food. Not like Biwon restaurant all you can eat (you can't compare the food)!!!! 

E-Jo is a pit stop must go.

May look sketchy on the outside if your not from the area, visiting, or just don't even know where to go for Korean places but this is one of my favorite places for some homemade korean stew.

922 I had seen the reviews for E-Jo and mentioned it to my Korean wife as a place to try. We found it and although the off-the-Strip area looks seedy we parked on the side street without any problems.  Very friendly staff and a clean environment.  I ordered the all-the-above soup for myself and enjoyed it.  Don't remember ever having guts in a soup before but it went down well.  Liked adding my own salt and red pepper to the soup.  The Kimchi was probably the best restaurant kimchi I've had.  Surprised to not get the usual assortment of side dishes associated with Korean restaurants but maybe that was an option?  My wife liked it enough for us to go back two days later and try a different meal (ox tail soup for me and the blood soup for her) and again we were pleased.  Ate a second bowl of rice.  Usually we eat at Ginseng Restaurant on the Strip (easy walking distance) but now we have a nice alternative that's worth the drive.

923 It definitely caters to the Korean population because no one speaks good English around here and it is a hole in the wall kind of place but very clean. They only serve 2 bon chon but it is homemade pickled turnips and Kim chi is tasty. 

It's known for their soups and I ordered the combination but they don't give much meat or noodles which I am accustomed to in Chicago. Food is usually expensive in LV but I thought they should have served at least 4 thin slices of beef instead of approximately 1/2 that amount. Service is only average but this is the way in most Korean smaller restaurants. 

I'm not likely to recommend coming back because I have a small appetite and I didn't leave here feeling full at all.

925 korean bone broth soups....sulluntang, breakfast korean style...to soothe stomachs after a sinful night in vegas...order of korean pancakes to start...crispy golden deliciousness...well made pancakes...majority taking the brisket sullungtang...self taking the doganee sullungtang (knee cartilage soup), but basically given a tendon soup...instructions are simple for sullungtang...season it yourself, customize it yourself...add some sea salt, but remember sea salt is extra salty...add some green onions if desired...black pepper for little kick...some will go as far as to add kimchi juice straight up in their soup...there are no rules to personal preference!..kimchi jars and plates given...radish and napa cabbage...sissor to cut it  yourself...any size you want...careful not to splatter on yourself or neighbors...korean green peppers are milder...before they ripen to a red firey fiery...dip the green peppers in the brownish/reddish paste...mixture of fermented beans (korean miso) and things...overall, the kimchi is decent...korean soup restaurants are suppose to have the best kimchi, but e-jo is just decent....the soup is light and not as rich as wanted, but it does the job....

926 We ordered spicy pork bulgogi , comes with rice
And kimchi.  This is the most traditional Korean food I ever had.  The meat is not too sweet or spicy  and it's also mixed with vegetables , served on a hot plate.  
One order is perfect for two people.
Will come back here the next time I'm in Las vegas.

928 Visiting from Hawaii craving some Korean food.
This place is very different from the restaurants on Oahu.  Typically you will get a bunch of different side dishes before the main entree. You will get two types of kim chee, cabbage and radish.  Menu has no Jhun, or kalbi soup.  Service is good.  Place is clean.

929 One of the best oxtail soup places ever.  Always consistent, high quality ingredients, great service, delicious  kimchi and very authentic.

Little out of the way from the strip but well worth the travel.

930 My husband and I have been coming to E-jo whenever we are in town from LA. On our recent trip, we were disappointed with the service. The food is good! The Kimchi is the BEST! I too am a huge fan of their Kimchi and would buy their kimchi by the gallons.  However, with that said, if you want people to come back, then hospitable treatment go along way. 
Also being honest with prices would be good too! The menu had one price but was charged more, and wasn't even told. Unfortunately, my husband and I want to go elsewhere. We will sure miss the Kimchi!

931 This place is sooo good! They have a simple menu, but you know they make the food very well as I have visited this place every time I have visited Vegas and the taste has not changed! The last time i went, it was a raining a lot in the morning, so a hot soup was the perfect choice! 

I got the mixed meat soup and quite honestly, the soup base was the highlight. Don't get me wrong, I still scarfed down my meal, but this broth is so refreshing, clean, and really warm your inside. It's almost as if they made the side dishes to compliment your meal because the two options of kimchee and the fresh peppers were a perfect match with the soup.

For those of you that may not be into the main dish they sell here, they also have other options like rice cake soup and kalbi. My other family members ordered these dishes and they were not disappointed!  

Definitely give this place a try. You will be glad you did, especially on a chilly day like it is this week in Vegas!!!

932 Absolutely awful!!  smelled, Kalbi only had end meat for $27??? I actually would give this restaurant no star!! It used to be one of restaurants we always come as soon as we arrive in Vegas, like this evening. But no more!! Need another competition to wake them up!!

933 E-Jo is a Korean Sul lung Tung Soup House which is boilled beef soup. The choices are what cuts of meat you want in your soup. There are some other options and the hangover soup has spicy bean paste added. The grilled meat start at $17 per plate. The soup is good and the Kimchi is excellent. But the green onion topping is very roughly cut. 

Service is good but English is limited so you need to use the menu item numbers. Great place to get a hot piping bowl of beef soup.

934 Review #245 - 2016

Showed up around 10:30 AM on Dec. 18th, right after we picked up our rental car & picked up a few items at the CVS Store a few blocks down The Strip.

We ordered our usuals, the mixed seul long tang soup, and I decided to head over to the bathroom with my baby's bottle, which I'd just bought from CVS since I forgot her bottle back home.  Yup!  Being a new mom all over again after 14 years does some weird stuff to your brain!

When one of the waitresses saw me walking over towards the back, she asked me if I needed help and I told her I needed to find the bathroom to wash the baby's bottle and she told me she could take it to wash in the kitchen.  That was so sweet of her!

The food was still as delicious as I remembered from our first trip here back in 2014.  As much as I try to make my way over on every Vegas trip, it's hard when you travel with other people who don't share the same taste in food.

Good food and great service, we'll always be back!

935 Solid 4 - 4.5. If you're looking for solong tang then this place is the best. Every meal is accompanied by green chilis and soybean paste, dipping sauces, kimchi and kimchi daikon radish. Just cut the radish and kimchi yourself with included scissors. I think the kimchi is a bit more spicy than the radish but still very good. For the bone soup you can get just slices of beef or tendon or a combination. Garnish with green onions ans salt and your good to go. Very good for hangovers or it you want a hearty meal. They also have a bbq section but i didnt try. I want to say that this place is more catered to soup though. For larger groups they have a hot pot for around 36 or so. Also place is small so you may have to wait.

936 HIDDEN GEM LEGIT KOREAN SOUPS

If you love Korean food go here. It's LEGIT as you can get. They have all the soups that'll cure your hangover...

Oxtail soup: 5/5 full of meaty bones. Comes with rice. 
Kalgooksoo: 5/5 if you love noodles get this. Add the chili paste, soy sauce green onion sauce and add salt to taste. It's a bit bland but you add your own salt. 
Dumpling rice cake soup: 5/5 you can't go wrong with this dish.

They also have Korean bbq like bulgogi and chicken bbq which are both delicious!

937 The bibimbap is okay, but I found the flavours boring and out of harmony with one another. Also, the eggs are not freshly fried. I understand why they do this, but the pre-fried egg was rubbery and lukewarm. 

The sushi was also okay. I purchased a tray of salmon sashimi and california rolls. The sashimi was acceptable, but not the best grab-and-go I've had. The california rolls were atrocious. The avocado was rock hard and stringy with brown spots. Completely inedible.

938 I came here on a whim yesterday as I was working from home and too lazy to make my food. First off, this is fast food and located within the Sussex Centre across from the Novotel Hotel in Mississauga.  

Most of the people buying work in the building so there are only two small tables.  I don't, but I was curious to see what was in there and saw a Korean fast food place which intrigued me.  They had bimibap, bento boxes, noodle bowls and sushi.  The sushi looked expensive (about $10 per roll), but everything else seemed reasonably priced.  I had a bento box, where you can get to choose your protein, get a side of rice and veggies and then get to choose two sides (sweet potato noodles, fruits, rolls, etc) and it was $10 before tax.  I think everything else was close to that as well. 

As for the quality of food, well the ingredients were definitely fresh and very well laid out.  The service was very friendly too.  However, overall taste was average, but if I worked in the building, I would go again. Actually, since I only live a 2 minute walk away and I'm feeling too lazy to cook and I'm working from home, I'd go.  

Verdict: Good healthy fast food place if you're in the area, but I'd assume they only be open Monday to Friday during the lunch hours since it's an office building.

939 I always sorta scoffed when I saw this chain downtown Toronto, I kinda wrote it off as crummy Korean fast food and I never gave it a chance. Recently, they opened a brand new location in the Sussex centre near Burnhamthorpe and Hurontario in Mississauga near where I have my office and I had the opportunity (more like had limited options otherwise) to try them out.

Wow. It's actually a legit meal. It's healthy, it's fresh, they provide MASSIVE portions and it was such a great value. 

You can have fresh sushi which is pre-prepared but always fresh daily, or an assortment of Korean-infused mains, Without question, the go-to option @ Bibab Express is their Bibimbap bowls (boxes). It's set up in the same style as a Subway or Chipotle where you build your meal with the ingredients you want from meat to veggies to rice (white, brown or purple) and top it with the sauces of your choice.

I went with a purple rice, bulgogi beef bibimbap topped with everything including a fresh egg. It was super heavy in my hands but light on the stomach in the end (as well as the wallet - $8.50+tax). 

Best of all when you purchase 9 bibimbap's you get your 10th free! Really enjoyed this and it's definitely a great fresh healthy alternative to nearby food courts at SquareOne Mall.

Eatcrest Out!

941 Favorite spot to get Korean fried chicken. Best flavor is spicy in my opinion. Chicken is crispy and is not dry at all. I was disappointed with the service when we last went. We were the only ones in the restaurant and it took the waitress a solid 10 min before she even asked us for our drink orders. Then we were given the wrong order. Staff gave us extra food to make up for the error which was kind. Unsure why the service was so off when we were the only ones in store. Will order takeout next time.

943 Went for lunch with a co-worker, around 1:30. Quite a few people were already there; very quiet inside, nice music selection. Beverage order taken immediately and almost as quickly wanted a food order...we weren't ready, wanted to catch up a bit first and browse the menu (many choices, things we didn't understand fully; thankful there were pictures and descriptions with most dishes). After we were given enough time we got our order taken...food came out in a very nice time frame. I ordered onion rings as the appetizer (would prefer smaller rings, but so crunchy and the spicy ketchup was great). I had the wrap, it was good...not spectacular, I should've ordered something more authentic. My co-worker order the seafood bibimbap...she ate all the goodies out of it and was taking home the rice for dinner =) it was so colorful and fresh looking! We were there close to 2 hours and never felt pressured to leave or to hurry up, very nice!

944 I heard about BonChon on the radio and I'm sure glad I did. It's tucked away in a huge shopping center so if you don't see it at first, don't lose hope. 

Food: Outstanding! I ordered the chicken tenders. Half spicy and half Asian garlic (I think). The spicy is no joke. Different from a buffalo type spicy, this is like eating sweet fire. It burns but it burns so good. The garlic was the perfect remedy for the spicy. I would absolutely get this again! My wife got the bulgogi and loved it. Hefty portions and delicious tender meat. I will mention she grew up (until she was 9 years old) in Korea so the fact she loved her dish is saying something! Lastly, the potstickers as an appetizer were perfectly cooked and not soggy like some places. 

Service: This is what put it over the top for me. Dining with a newborn can be tricky but they were more than accommodating. Our waiter was fantastic. I'm not too critical of service but it's rare when I'm this surprised how well the service was! 

To be honest I debated on rating it 4 stars only because it was a little pricey but the exceptional service made up for it. Will return for sure!

947 Hidden in the back of a plaza tucked in the corner is a cute spot with good food.  Shrimp fried dumplings on slaw, it's an appetizer big enough to share.  Edame are fresh and pretty large pods, very tasty with just enough salt sprinkled on top.  Chicken Fried Rice is short on chicken,  has tomatoes in it and heavy on a grll taste, it is just okay.  French fries are amazing and every table had them.

948 Great service.  Fantastic wings!  Can't wait to try other items on their menu.  Very disappointed they don't have a liquor license and was told it wouldn't have it for 2 weeks. Pure laziness as they've been working on opening this location for 4 months. I won't go back until I can drink a beer with my chicken wings!

95 health rating on a newly built restaurant?!  Obviously the manager/ owner doesn't know what they're doing!!

949 I ordered fried rice and paid an extra $2 for bulgogi. The rice came with barely any meat. The tiny pieces that were in there were so small it was hard to distinguish them from the rice. The fried shumai were burnt. If you like mall food courts, then you will love this place. If you have working taste buds and don't like wasting money, go somewhere else.

951 Bonchon is a fantastic addition to South Charlotte.  You have to seek it out, as its location is tucked away in a small shopping center.  It's by far the most exciting business in that little nook.

Now, what we went for - the food.  Crispy fried chicken strips with soy garlic glaze, yes please!  It's hard to venture out from these savory treats, once you try them.  My whole family loves them and it's great how you can order a 10, 20, or 30 piece strip box to go.  Cook some rice and a vegetables at home and dinner is served.

The interior is nice and clean, with a full bar.  The staff is friendly and service was good.  We will visit quite often, and hope South Charlotte and Pineville embraces this new establishment!

Will absolutely be coming back. Service is also A+!!

958 I've always wanted to try bonchon and my dreams finally came true!

The spicy was actually pretty spicy (it stacks up). The soy garlic was delicious and I was sad when I ran out . The radish was a great necessity because it helped to cut the oil of the fried chicken and rejuvenate my taste buds.

The takoyaki was very yummy.

I would recommend just getting a small size if you aren't starving, or getting a medium and an appetizer and splitting that between 2-3 people

960 So this was my second trip...I wanted to get something that they were known for (instead of the wrap that I had before). I ordered a 10 piece strip mixed hall and half with an order of onion rings to go. There was no one in actual restaurant, one to go order picked up while I was there...so not busy. The onion rings attacked my sniffer the whole way home, I couldn't wait to rip in to them. I open the rings and they looked awesome, I open the strips and they look...they look like wings =( I'm eating them and they're good, but not what I ordered.

961 I was surprised at how the inside looked compared to my expectations. It's really really nice. Nice bar. TV's on a few walls. And outside sitting. Started with the calamari which looked a lot like onion rings when placed on table. They were the most tender I've had and while I was disappointed that no sauces came with it they have a sauce built in. A little sweet. On to the chicken strips. Lunch menu gives you 8 nice size pieces of chicken and a side. I will say the chicken looked better then it tasted. The coating and the sauce had great taste and texture. But very over cooked and a little dried out. 
I will return but not for the strips.

962 Used to love their chicken and decided to try this location. Was not impress at all. Got the spicy wings for lunch. The wings barely had any sauce, maybe a little drip of sauce per wings on one side of the wing. Very stingy with their sauce. And the chicken was very dry also.

965 First time here and it was okay. I ordered the half&half lunch wing combo special or so I thought. I was given a mix of wings and drummettes. Go figure?  The spicy flavor trumped soy& garlic, plus preferred the wing meat.  For my side I enjoyed the thick skinned French fries.  Lunch was good going down, but felt slightly ill afterwards.  Could have been all the spices or related to the strange smell of the place. Glad to see this was observed by another reviewer, plus does not help matters as it is  located next to a pet salon.... Toss up if I repeat visit.

971 Korean restaurants seem to be popping up in a lot of places, so I wanted to give it a whirl.  My friend, Randy, and I saw this restaurant when we ate at a nearby restaurant a few weeks ago. We agreed to meet there for our monthly lunch gathering.  First impression was great.  The atmosphere is alluring, with an impressive array of visual stimuli.  Loved the red color scheme. It was quiet enough to enjoy a good conversation.   Unfortunately, the food was just not my favorite. The fried chicken strips were so chewy that I couldn't finish it. The kimichi cold slaw was good for the first few bites, but I couldn't finish it either.   The iced tea tasted like instant tea, not freshly brewed.   Finally, we noticed the Sanitation Score was a 90.5.  This is clearly below the standard that is acceptable to me.    I am glad that I experienced this restaurant, but I will not return, unless Randy insists, and I don't think he will.

975 I was surprised to see Bonchon with a group of restaurants Yelp wanted to see if I'd review. I would have thought I wrote a review immediately after eating. The chicken is double fried and extra crispy. The half and half meal gives you the best of everything - both wings and legs, half spicy Korean/half fermented Korean. I swap one spicy one funky to keep from getting over heated by the spice. It's a good system. Food is amazing, and the crispiness is out of control. I'd definitely recommend this place, and I see that it's a chain, so I'm trying to find another one to visit on my travels...

979 Pros: Delicious foods for reasonable prices.

We order the pork tacos, pork slider and avocado salmon ball. All met our expectations. 

My favorite dish was the avocado salmon ball. It's a little small so you may want an appetizer to go with it. The taste was spot-on. 

For the price and convenient location, we'll go here over the best place for pork tacos (Seoul imo) all the time for a quick and casual dinner.  

This would be a perfect place to eat family style and try a little bit of everything.

I will return and try more dishes! Can't wait to try the wings!

Cons: the 2 person high tops are too close together. It makes me very uncomfortable being so close to another table. There is no privacy.

Chairs need to have sliders on the bottom as they are currently very loud when you move a chair.

The tv screens really don't add anything to the decor... but if you want to watch the game, they have lots of tvs. Personally, I think they cheapen the atmosphere.

981 Thank God my flight back home was delayed. If it wasn't delayed, I would have never came here and tried this delicious friend chicken! Fried chicken is my guilty pleasure. My secret affair. My hidden soulmate. The flavor and spice was perfect. The soy flavor was not so much. The crunchiness in each bite made the fried chicken all that much better. My little cousins got the popcorn chicken and my uncle got the clear noodles. Some spicy fried dumplings and a bowl of the bimbimbap. We had a bit of everything and we were all pleased. Coming back to this franchise soon!

982 I was quite impressed with this Bonchon location not going to lie...it's probably better than the locations we have in MD. The restaurant was spacious, cute decors, and the bar area looked pretty cool. We ordered for take out and the hostess that helped us was pleasantly friendly! She offered us drinks while we waited for our food and interacted with us. Well-deserved 5 stars for the customer service. We ordered half and half chicken wings (soy garlic and spicy), garlic parmesan fries, and fried rice. Everything tasted delicious and fresh! The chicken skin was crispy and the fries were flavored perfectly, the garlic taste wasn't overpowering. This wasn't my first rodeo with Bonchon but there was something about the chicken in the South that shined above the rest (not trying to be funny it was finger licking good). I know my family in Charlotte's in heaven for having to open up this location. They no longer have to wait to visit home to eat Korean fried chicken!

985 Ate lunch here with my wife and 3yo. First time, so we got an assortment.  Started with wings, Garlic was really tasty and the spicy was flavorful though almost a bit too spicy for me (I can normally eat buffalo without a thought). The chicken was fresh hot and crispy. Yum! The bulgogi Korean tacos were very tasty and the bipimbap (with spicy chicken) was good but we thought the beef would have been better.  
In all the food was tasty and the service good.  The restaurant was loud even only half full, and was difficult to hold a conversation sitting across from my wife.  Could use some sound dampening in there.

986 Omg!!!! The best Asian food ever!!! I kept hearing my friend rave about it and we finally hit that little spot up. It was such a great lunch spot. Oh and they have a bar as well....huge plus. I need to get back there to sample the drinks. The waitstaff is very friendly and helpful. Chicken was so good I actually cleaned my bones and was sucking my fingers(so not classy) but a napkin just wouldn't do. So needless to say I'll be back...again and again and  again.

987 Food was great, and didn't disappoint.  Had the lunch combo with fries.  Food came out quick and was delicious.  The location is sort of hidden off the main rd, I hope that doesn't hurt the business as this one is much more convenient than the other location.

988 So I go by this place everyday because I live within a couple blocks. After reading many excellent reviews I have to agree that the food here is just so good! I loved the pork buns. The bun is a soft spongy round, sorta sweet bun, with a strip of perfectly seasoned and lightly fried pork belly Accompanied by something like coleslaw and a pickle? I think that was?! I will order those again. The beef Korean tacos were delicious, but a little messy, so make sure you're not wearing your favorite dry clean only shirt. Edamame was perfectly steamed... But I think it could use a little more salt. The pork potstickers will definitely make you want to order them again. If you get the spicy... Be advised is the type of Spicey hot that makes your tongue feel like it's on fire... Even my lips  were burning, but its a good burn.. And you'll probably crave more of them as you eat.

989 It's not very often that I try a new place and from the first bite of food am AMAZED!! This place is awesome. Cozy atmosphere with a nicely stocked bar, friendly wait staff, and fast service. I ordered the soy garlic wings!! LORD, have mercy!! Crunchy, and tender. Seasoned well and sauce was perfect. The fried rice... amazing. My biggest surprise was the bolgani tacos!!! Gotta get the tacos!! We will be back for this frequently! This is a must try spot. So happy we found this place!!

990 The food is great...when you actually receive it. We came there for lunch and asked to be seated outside. Mind you, there was no one outside and maybe three tables inside. We ordered our food quickly. I ordered the salmon avocado ball and my friend the japchae noodle bowl. It took the waitress 15 minutes to bring our waters and an additional 20 minutes to bring ONE entree out..yes ONE!! Then 10 minutes later the other entree comes out. No apology nothing....so I am giving them 3 stars to be nice because the food was good. But don't come there if you're hungry because it will be an hour before you get your food

991 I met my cousin out here for a relaxed birthday dinner. From the service to the food, it was great. Our waitress was very helpful. When our food arrived it was fresh and steaming. The portions are so large. With my schedule, I love having great food to heat up later. I ordered the bulgogi and it was wonderful. The steak was tender, the vegetables cooked just right. I will definitely be coming back.

992 I had high expectations for this place and I wasn't totally let down, although also not as good as I was expecting. Let me explain. 

We came for lunch on a weekday, and only a few tables were filled. Service was average throughout. We decided to split the 10 piece wings (half spicy and half soy garlic) and the bibimbap with bulgogi (other choices are tofu and spicy chicken) amongst 2 people. The food came out pretty quickly. The fried chicken was very crispy, though more sauce/flavoring would help it out more. We were also given 4 drumsticks even though we ordered all wings. The bibimbap was a letdown, especially at almost $14. Maybe my expectations were too high but it was just a lot of white rice in a hot stone bowl topped with veggies that weren't especially outstanding. Not a large portion of meat either. So next time I'd stick with the fried chicken. I also wish the meal came with kimchi instead of requiring us to order it as a side item. The fried chicken does come with pickled radishes, which balance out the salty greasiness of the chicken nicely.

993 Excellent! 

I went for lunch and got the half and half combo. Half spicy/half soy garlic and half wings/drums. Chicken was crispy and juicy. It's a different kind of coating than you might expect. Almost cracker like and I'm thinking it was panko. 
That works well for me, but if you're expecting traditional coating you will be surprised and hopefully in a good way. Had no issues with service. My soda was refilled before it was empty and the food was brought out quickly and when hot. My side was kimchi and it was a good blend between crisp, spicy and refreshing. Next time I'll try the pickled radish and there will definitely be a next time!

994 Came here a few days ago. Just to check this place out and compare to the Woodlawn location.  

1. The decor is a lot nicer than the one in Woodlawn. 4 stars

2. The food is not as good as the Woodlawn location. 3 stars. I ate the fried chicken. And tasted like it was deep fried too long. Very very crispy batter. Although the meat and nice and juicy. 

If I'm going for the food. I rather go to the Woodlawn location more in my opinion.

995 I ordered food at 2:15 for delivery at 4:00 and was told that it would be 10 minutes late due to them not being able to find a driver. I called again at 4:03 and they said that the driver was on the way. I called the restaurant back and they had no updates on the delivery and explained that grub hub was responsible. I got an email from the driver at 4:23 and I called her and asked her where she was. She proceeded to lie and said that she called me and had already left my location. I was standing outside since 4:07 and did not see her or receive a phone call. I never received my food and I won't be ordering from them again. They need to fix their wonky partnership with grub hub for deliveries because it's obviously not working.

996 Thumbs up!  Good food and atmosphere.  The manager/owner welcomed us and told us about the restaurant concept, menu, and Korean food details.  We had a great server who was very attentive.  We tried the spicy chicken wings, Kimchi, Korean tacos, and Bonchon wrap with soy garlic chicken.  Had plenty to bring home for left overs.  Everything we tried was excellent.  We will be back.

997 This chicken is like crack. It's indescribably delicious. I had a garlic soy drums, and the outside was so crispy.  I cannot wait to go back here and eat that chicken again. The atmosphere was fine too. Cute place. That chicken though.

998 Best chicken ever! I had been dying to try this chicken since I've lived in Illinois. So many people mukbang this place and it always appealed to me. I ordered the food through yelp and it came right on time. The food was hot and so flavorful. BF got the soy garlic & I tried the 1/2 Spicy & soy garlic. If you're sensitive to hear, please don't order the spicy.  It's banging! The radish is a must for the palette. Onion rings are huge and you get A LOT. So happy to have finally got a chance to try this place. I honestly think this is going to be my fave place to eat

999 Server was attentive, food came out promptly. Spicy was decently apocy, put a tingle in my mouth. Did strips, fries and pot stickers.  Not as crispy as I would have expected for Korean fried chicken but not bad. Would come back.
