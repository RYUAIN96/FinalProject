0 Our first dining experience in a North Korean restaurant, totally run and operated by women folks from North Korea. If you are there for dinner, you could get to enjoy the performances - traditional and modern from waitresses that double up as performers. Waitresses were friendly and despite the fact that they have to multi-task, did not slow down the service.

The whole experience was quite strange. Food wise, that's not too bad at all but I would not return just for the food and the performance. Once is good enough.

1 It was my first meal in North Korean restaurant.
Comparing to similar Korea food restaurant, the interior is simpler and atmosphere is rather nothing special. However, the food was great.
I ordered "So Yukgejang", spicy beef soup with a bowl of rice and the taste was one of the best for such soups.
I was alone there for my lunch but was served by two beautiful ladies though out the meal and it was pleasant experienced to chat with various topics with North Koreans.
Highly recommended to try food there and have a chat with them.

2 Food are generally good. Tried lunch-Bulkogi-grilled beef and Reimen-cold noodle, which were not bad, or could say even better than expected. Reasonably priced. Served by beautiful waitressesabout, most probably selected ones, who
spoke English and/or Japanese. Rather strange setting, many long and big tables, mainly for group guests. Better ask for a smaller table.

3 Food is generally good. Worth mentioning are kImchi which is mild spicy version, chewy tasty stirred fried beef & excellent scallop; & not forgetting the spicy taufu soup. The waitresses dressed in Korean traditional dresses will go up the stage for musical performance around 8 pm, which is kinda interesting.

4 We've passed by the place a couple times and were always curious about what goes on inside and what North Korean cuisine is about. When our friends came for a visit, we thought what better way to entertain them after reading the reviews online.

Food was really really delicious. The fried sesame leaves were a surprise. We love the topoki (rice cake), kimchi and especially this cold pork slices dish.

We were late for the show and yes, our waitress too left us midway service and hopped on the stage to perform. Show starts at 7:30pm every nite. It was a hoot just watching the whole fanfare but we had a tonne of fun. The only drag about the place was the chain smoking customers. Will we be back? Maybe when we have friends in town to entertain.

5 This restaurant is like the setting of a 60s Bond movie. Food overpriced and too spicy for my sensitive palette. Waitresses creepy and unfriendly, only smiling when presenting the bill. An alienating experience. Was so hungry after, had to buy so.e dumplings from a roadside stand .

6 Be sure to try the fried sesame leaves. Food was good, and at 8:00 a dancing and singing show started. It lasted about 35 minutes. I had expected propaganda because I heard there would be some, but there was not. Table service was OK but not great -- a bit difficult to get our waitress's attention.

7 We had a feeling of North Korea for the evening. The food is honest and good and generously served. The waitresses are North Korean and they propose a stage performance which is taking you in another world and time. Definitely a place to stop by when you are in Phnom Penh

8 I have been to several North Korean restaurants in several cities, they are pretty similar in many ways. Nothing special if you have been to a North Korean restaurant, but if you are familiar with the Korean food often seen in South Korea, some dishes with the same names are worth tasting. North Koreans make kimchi with a different way, very unique. Not the best place if you expect a conversation with your friends, because their music is loud and are the reason a lot of people going there for, and who knows what the waitresses would do when they hear what you are talking about, they all speak Khmer, English and apparently Korean very well.

9 In the middle of Phnom Penh you'll find this strange place. The waitresses - all very beautiful and look exactly the same - are sent here from North Korea and stay for about three years. The purpose: to "inform" us about how fantastic there home country is.

The food was quite good, actually not so different from Cambodian food, but we avoided dog and some other strange dishes.

At 7.30 (this was on a Friday) the show started. All of a sudden our waitresses stopped serving food and got on stage. They danced something that reminded me of Sound of Music. And then they sang Honey, honey (Abba) and one of the played the violin good enough to get a job in any simphony orchestra. In the end they picked up three electric guitars and played.

The whole show was just so bizarre that we sat laughing all the time. We brought our three children and they didn't like the food so much but enjoyed the show.

Of course, you should not support the regime of North Korea. I feel a bit ashamed about it, but it really was an interesting experience.

11 I never thought that I'd be getting any sort of north Korean experience while I was in Cambodia. But it's like a buy one get one, fly to Cambodia, and see North Korea! They show was amazing, I enjoyed it a lot, I was totally awed by the way they spun and twirled, and the many many instruments that could play! They don't allow you to take pictures inside, but they won't ask you to delete your photos either once you get your chance to. The food was okay, but just order a simple dish or something and just enjoy the show!

12 Heard a lot about this place. One of our visitors said was his favorite restaurants in Phnom Penh--could not wait to try it. It was interesting and unusual from a Western perspective, but definitely not as freaky as others might think. The food was good, not the best Korean food I have ever had (had North Korean food in Seoul which was better). The pork ribs and bimbimbap at a hot stove pot was pretty good. The dumpling and the vegetable dish were nothing to write home about. The waitresses were definitely quite talented, well-dressed and well-groomed. My friends thought they look angry from time to time--they were a bit stressed since they had to wait on all customers and to perform as well. Don't expect that they will come by to chat with you. The waitresses and the show definitely were trying to reinforce the traditional expectation of women being very thin, submissive and gentle. No wonder most of the patrons there tonight were males. Who knows how much of the show were truly north Korean or modified to feed a particular expectation? The restaurant is closed by 9 pm which I did not expect. Overall not very memorable, food was only alright--would not likely go back as the place did allow smoking which always put a big dent on the overall dining experience.

13 I have seen and eaten at many freaky restaurants in Africa and Asia, but this is restaurant is a different ball game altogether. It felt like I was in a place meant for North Korean propaganda and that experience alone deserves five stars.

Food is decent. Yes, there is dog meat if you want to try it. There is a limited beer selection.

But the best part of the restaurant is the waitresses and the videos. All waitresses are made to look like dolls and perform in between serving your food. Expect anything from a covering of Celine Dion to hardcore rock music. My waitresses hurriedly dropped food at my table and rushed to get on stage. It was quite the spectacle. And then there are the videos. Lush landscapes and beaches, which I assume are meant to project N.Korea is a good light.

Definitely visit if you are in the area.

15 This restaurant is at the main road of Monivong Bld. We were sceptical after reading the reviews n possible motives behind it, however we decided to try it since we will never visit Pyongyang. Yes,all the waitresses are dressed in yellow n red chiffon hanbok,same shoes,same scrunchy n similar hairstyle etc. They are soft-spoken, pretty n friendly with the Korean guests. The food is rather similar to South Korean's,or it's just those dishes that we ordered. The kimchi with pork ($8) was good, not sour or too oily. The dog soup ($12) is probably an acquired taste, with lots of spice n some chilli. The boiled mackerel fish ($10) is yummy for fish lovers. Jinro Soju is a tad too expensive for our liking, at $6. The performance starts at 8pm, with the waitresses singing, dancing n playing guitar, drum, keyboard n gu zheng! Very impressive! Definitely worth a visit for the curious, but pls bear with those ppl smoking in the air-conditioned restaurant.

16 This whole series of restaurants serve as nothing but a cash collector for the NK government. If you don't mind that...

Get the dog stew, it was pretty good. In fact all the food was pretty good. It's expensive for PP but then again you are paying for the Hennesey drinking habits of an entire country's plutocracy.

The service received (or lack of) was disgraceful.. it was the worst I have ever received in any restaurant in the world.
After being made to feel extremely uncomfortable, we walked out not ordering anything, vowing never to return again ....
Do not bother spending your money and your time there. Plenty of other restaurants in Phnom Penh to choose from where you are treated with respect and courtesy, something this restaurant lacks

18 This is a restaurant that is definitely worth a visit. Heard from a friend that it is one of the only two North Korean restaurants that is not in North Korea. Food there is on the expensive side (cost us USD 34 for a stir fried pork, dumplings, kimchi soup, beef fried rice and drinks), but the show in itself is worth it! Food was pretty good as well!

The show consists of a series of dancing, singing and percussion. It starts at 8pm, so you may want to go slightly earlier to have your dinner and concentrate on the show when it starts. You are also not allowed to take pictures.

We went at about 8pm when the staff are preparing for the show and they looked a bit flustered and service was a little rude. However, this changed completely after the show and they were really friendly and asking whether you enjoyed the food and the show.

Highly recommended place!!!! Most tuk tuk drivers should know where it is so it should not be difficult to get there!

19 If you don't mind propping up the North Korean regime then take a visit to Pyongyand, probably the closest to North Korea you will ever get. In line with other reviewers very bizarre to see the waitresses suddenly performing rousing songs on stage. Also had to chuckle when we saw stewed dog on the menu - no we did not order it!

20 This is the restaurant equivalent of smoking DMT. You do it once and appreciate the experience and then never do it again because you fear for your mental health. I felt really wierd being there as its like supporting the North Korean Government who didn't get this well known by being happy fluffy hippies. The waitresses are cold and unsmiling (only my male mates were too impressed by them to tell. Hand picked apparently...). After half an hour of kimchi and incredibly expensive beer, they launched into this colourful, whirling, screeching show with "happy" smiling faces for the best part of an hour before going back to being grim and austere again. The place has the weirdest vibe of anywhere I've ever been. There wasn't much after dinner banter. I think we were all in a little shock. Like I said, it was a great experience and I'm glad I went but wow. Would I go back? Maybe just once...

21 Sitting down and reading the rather high prices on the menu at this restaurant I figured I must be missing something. The large, unattractive, brightly lit room was full of customers. The service was sporadically slow and unfriendly. The food was nothing to write home about.
Which left me scratching my head, why were there some many people here?
And then it happened.
The lights were dimmed as images of serene forests and waterfalls looped on the flat screen TV. A piano accordion suddenly appeared and the waitresses began singing. There were fake bouquets of flowers, costumes resembling the ugly duckling after she grew into a beautiful swan, heart shaped maracas, mostly North Korean karaoke songs and a random version of 'On Top Of The World' by the Carpenters. The highlight was the waitresses rocking out on electric guitar, bass guitar and a drum solo.
Yes it was overpriced. Yes it was extremely weird. Yes I would never go back, but without a doubt, I will never forget it.

22 This is another one of those best kept secrets. Firstly as a westerner you will feel like the only person there, you will be, the place is full of Koreans and some other Asian nationalities. The place is brightly lighten. The menu was interesting, guess there is no real difference between South Korean and North Korean cuisine, either that or we did try some of the more unique offerings. The waitresses are a highlight, wearing very bright almost brides dresses, they are very friendly and speak perfect English........BUT then......they double as the cast of the most fantastic restaurant show I have seen. Loads of fun and just a overall great experience. Go experience, you will not be disappointed. An absolute treat.

23 If you look for quiet place I guess it is not the right place for you, since they have live music, smoking, speaking loudly (Korean and Chinese).

What impressed me a lot is waitress there she play as many role. She can be waitress, singer, instrument. When is the time, most of waitress will be on stage, sing, dance.....

25 If you truly want to get a taste of what authentic Korean food taste like, I would not recommend Miss Korea.

Average food at the expensive prices. I praise for the menu tho as it has a good variety of choices between side dishes, chicken, seafood, beef etc. I believe the most proud dish of the restaurant of the BBQ, however I personally think the dish is over priced for the under seasoning meat, little proportion on the dish.

Nevertheless, I do recommend to order Tteokbokki ( Korean rice cake) and the rice dishes as they are quite delicious and easy to eat.

26 Popped in on spec during Chinese New Year celebrations, so there was a bit of a wait for a table. We do enjoy Korean bbq, first we ordered vegetable Goyza whilst waiting for the bbq to warm up. We then had a selection of dishes, beef in beer, chicken, mushrooms, spuds etc along with lettuce, rice and chilli and garlic for me to give the meal an extra kick. The dishes did come out rather haphazardly, indeed the potatoes which took the longest to cook came out last. House wine is great value at around £13 a bottle, there’s beer to inc. Hite if you want something Korean. Service is slightly random, though tbf it was very busy when we arrived. Food is good though, and overall we certainly enjoyed our meal. And at £50 excl service it’s good value. Btw it’s cash only here (plenty of cash points nearby).

27 I came here twice so far and love the food, Miss Korea is a real authentic Korean restaurant with BBQ plates on the table and a huge menu of everything from kimchi pancakes, bibimbap and a variety of jigae to BBQ meat and seafood, grilled and fried dishes plus a full vegetarian menu. The quality of food here is excellent and they’re kimchi is the best I’ve ever had in terms of UK Korean restaurants, the portions are big and the prices are cheap; mains are around £8-9, starters are around £5 each. The service is basic at best, the staff are efficient but not too attentive. They also do not accept card so it’s cash only, which is a downside. I loved the seafood bibimbap and spicy tofu jigae, both tasted divine. Overall high quality flavorful and authentic Korean food, cheap prices, generous portions but average service.

35 So, rocked up here last night with family and friends for my birthday.

Me - "Hi, have a table booked for 8 at 7"

Them - "errrrr....?"

That was kind of the way the rest of the night went.

Drinks order took over 20 mins to arrive.

Waitress to order the food took as long again to come over.

Then better part of an hour wait for anything.

My meal came, out, everyone else got left waiting. Had to go up twice to chase up everyone elses food. Must have been at least another 20 mins before some of theirs came. I had long finished before the 2 katsu curerys came at the end.

Ill give them their dues, they were very apologetic and threw in a couple of rounds of drinks and some food to try and appease things, which softened the blow a little.

The food though, was really really good. Bitter sweet really. Bursting with flavours, cooked to perfection and well presented. No one had anything other than beaming smiles they tucked in and it was clean plates all round. Not a bad word to say about that.

Just a shame that the service was soooo bad. If you dont mind spending 4hrs in a restaurant feeling like no one cares about your experience, the food is .ore than worth it xx

36 We have never tried Korean food so were looking forward to tasting something different.
We were greated and seated quickly and then informed they only accept cash, i wonder why that is??
The service was terrible, staff who couldn't care less. The food came out in dribs and srabs over 15 minutes. Mains first and then 15 mins later the rice. Useless.
I wouldn't recommend Miss Korea ever.

38 Decent Korean food. Service is ok - seems like a fairly new restauranteur team, so some of the sequencing was a bit off.
For example we ordered 2 starters, but one came after we’d started the main course, so we sent it back. And my wife’s main course came a few minutes after mine, which we had to flag.
However the team of waitresses were well dressed, and couldn’t do enough to help once they had realised their mistake.
So overall, decent food, a friendly restaurant team. They just need to improve some of their sequencing.
Overall Miss Korea is a good edition to Birmingham’s burgeoning Asian restaurant quarter.

44 Massively underwhelmed with this place. Very few bbqs actually worked, the food was honestly slightly dodgy ( although their veggie kimchi pancake and tofu were lovely but then again quite expensive for what they were ), the staff were rude and slow (only two tables were busy), and you cant pay with card. I had a really hot soup which was served with a metal spoon and burnt my tongue massively.

46 ”YOU GUYS ARE STUPID” THAT IS WHAT YOU SAID!!!!!
I had heard excellent things about this place but the experience I had today was the complete opposite!!! First of all, the one waitress at the place was absolutely rude, she had the worst scowl on her face and had kept pinning everything she did wrong on somebody who had little English skills as we had previously mentioned to the woman. She had ‘misheard’ one of the orders (which to me when she was taking the orders looked like she didn’t give a flying toss). When we explained she got the order wrong she gave us the dirtiest look and told us we were wrong and spent 30 minutes trying to get us to eat something we did not order and when we finally received what we had originally ordered it was once again not the right food! We had pointed specifically to braised chicken bulgogi with bbq sauce which we pointed at the photo which we revived a dish which we did not order. After finishing the food we received the bill and split it between 7 of us and 2 of the girls left shortly after. As soon as the girls had left the waitresses came over to tell us that they messed the bill up and it went from £78 to £85 which I must say we are 15 and some of us do not have a lot of money and would have helped if they could have told us before the girls had left. So overall I will not be re visiting and I do not recommend going there!!!

48 We ate in here for the 1st time on a Monday night. The restaurant was very busy and has a great ambiance. The servers were all friendly and the food is excellent. to start with we had the chicken Kangpopi, which was larger enough to have been a main course. The sauce was very good, not too spicy, but had enough flavour. For my main course, I had the Chicken katsu. Again this was very good, the chicken was well cooked and the curry sauce was great, the sticky rice was also brilliant. My wife had a beef dish. Which she enjoyed and was well cooked. This was my first visit to Miss Korea and will not be my last.
For a starter, 2 mains a soft drink and 1 glass of wine, the total was £34, which is excellent value.

49 Good was lovely. Drinks were served quickly. Food not so quickly. Waitress service wasn't the best, seemingly too rushed off their feet to be too friendly or offer any menu guidance etc. We have eaten korean bbq before but they should really assume that and should take the time to offer to assist new clientele. We ordered squid beef and spicy pork with sides for the bbq. Everything was lovely and fresh. Staff were attentive at keeping an eye on bbq temperature and replacing the grease proof paper laid over the bbq though. I would recommend but maybe not for ppl trying korean for the first time.

51 I’ve been there with friends 3 times and trust their advice on what to eat as menu is complex and difficult to use. The food is tasty and there is certainly no rush to take orders, deliver food and drink and to bring the bill. On each occasion, there have been lots of Chinese and/or Korean customers so this must mean they’re doing something right. Remember to take cash as they don’t accept card payments.

For people who don’t want the BBQ there’s enough choice on the menu. Reasonably priced too. Excellent. Can’t wait to come back

54 Went to try this restaurant the very first time but they successfully made us not to return. The Cash Only restaurant which you will be told when you sit down and of course again and again afterward. It was quick when order the food but long waiting time after that - you need to be patience and not too hungry so keep chatting or bring a book. Food was a bit disappointed. Frozen meat was served for BBQ - maybe it is ok??

Vegetables were not fresh. Food portion is small. We ordered a Kimchi fire rice as we love kimchi but it was so hard to dig out some kimchi and can hardly see the pork. Service was awful - all waitresses may had a super hard day. One of them turned off our BBQ cooker suddenly without even said a word when we still have meats on there.

Not a good experience, very disappointed.

55 I was excited to try this place for the Korean BBQ having wandered past a few weeks before. The welcome we received should have given some warning signs of the experience we’d receive - on arrival it took five minutes for the staff to acknowledge us. At which point we were asked to wait for a table. This was fine - however we then sat for 30 minutes before being shown to a table which was vacant when we had arrived half an hour prior.

We’d browsed the menu whilst waiting so were ready to order, but had to wait another 20 minutes to place our order - successive staff members telling us there was only one member of staff ‘who could take orders’. Whilst ordering we were then informed that the restaurant was cash only, so I had to wander to the local Tesco to get enough cash to cover the meal. A 20 minute wait at a busy cashpoint was not ideal but made little difference as our food took a good 45 minutes to arrive anyway.

I love a seafood pajeon (pancake) - this was the first of our order served, the Miss Korea version was unusually heavy and relatively tasteless. A disappointing start. Our bbq options then arrived - this was better, a good portion of pork belly which we struggled to finish. The experience however was affected again by the service. A surly member of staff repeatedly messing with the temperature controls without explanation and removing all food on the bbq to a plate again without explanation (it turns out to replace the grease proof paper on the grill). We also had to ask at least five times to have a glass of tap water delivered to the table - it eventually arriving at the end of the meal.

Overall a very disappointing experience, I don’t think we’ll be back - the food a pale imitation of decent Korean cuisine and some of the worst service I’ve received for a while.

60 I'm a korean, but I wasn't able to feel korean food in this restaurant. I think the owner is a chines, so the taste towards more on chines style than original korean. I had soybean paste stew and Bibimbab. The stew was so salty and less ingredient, I think if they put more tofu or other vegetables in the stew, it would be better. And my friend said the Bibimbab has to much rice and less vegetables and meats. Maybe, I can make better dishes than this restaurant. Also, I don't know why they are only available cash. I had to withdraw money from near ATM...

버밍엄에 한식당이 많이 없어서 기대 했는데 종업원들도 중국인이고, 한식을 잘하는 식당은 아닌것 같습니다. 된장찌개가 짠맛밖에 없어요. 비빔밥은 찌개보다 먹을만한데 같이 간 친구는 밥을 정말 많이 남겼어요.

65 I’ve always eaten here because I like the ambience of the restaurant. It looks way better than typical restaurant in most China town. I’ve also always loved eating Korean foods so no matter which restaurant I order it from I’m still gonna like it. However, the staff needs more training as they all seemed to be young student girls with no experience in customer service. Once you have your food on your table they don’t ask you anymore whether everything is okay or not. One time I had to call the attention of the waitress for 3 times and she still didn’t come to our table because they were busy (showed they were short of staff too and can’t handle busy shifts). I saw the manager (I assume she is) lowkey telling off the waitress when she didn’t know the name of the food she was serving. There were times too when the food order took so long to arrive on the table and not at the same time. They’ll bring one after the other! (Again, it showed slow service from the kitchen). Like I said I love Korean foods but the service in this restaurant needs improvement. Oh, i was surprised when i saw that they charge you for service charge when you don’t get the service you deserve to get anyway.

66 Was taken for a mother's day meal. What a meal if was we waited at least after hour before being dealt with. Was told we would need to pay by cash despite seeing others pay with card. We ordered drinks before my daughter went to the cash point I waited and the staff served the other familes arounf us despite us being seated first, did not want to bring the drinks out until she was back it was across the road in view of the restaurant. The food it's self over cooked tough, under seasoned and plain tasting. Was not enjoyable at all. The service was appalling it was like we was a burden to them the it was a shambles out starters we were brought one starter out of 3 and it took another 25mins before it was received. We had our mains before our starter arrived. Ended up just paying for what was ordered and leaving. Still hungry, disappointed.

68 Tucked in a corner of Chinatown, this little slice of Korea was almost empty when we arrived at 12:15. The waitress was swift to warn us that they were cash only but luckily there was a cash point in the Tesco express just up the road.

By 12:45, the place had filled with chatter; even the large banquet table down the middle was full. Reassuringly, the majority of diners were Korean and we were only 1 of two tables with Westerners on it. The menu was all in English and the waitresses were quick to take our orders and very helpful.

We ordered samgyupsal(belly pork) bbq, soy bean soup and kimchijeon (kimchi pancake). The kimchijeon came first, unusually it seemed to have been deep-fat fried and so had a slightly crisp coating but still tasted quite good. The soy bean soup was good though a little low on chillies. The samgyupsal was somewhat disappointing - rather than the thick meaty strips of the home country, this was more reminiscent of bacon; thin and overly fatty. Despite that, it was an enjoyable meal, coming to £32.00 for the three dishes plus sides and drinks. Is certainly go back to see how the other food compares!

69 Visited today with family, Attended Chinese New year celebrations. Short wait for table. One member of staff very helpful. Not had Korean food before. Barbecue looked good. Food piping hot, starters arrived separately few minutes apart ( although were very busy) Not bad first time eating experience. Some of waiting staff indifferent. Waited ages to pay. Only after we were seated and had ordered drinks were we told cash no cards.

70 Evening meal with a work colleague.

Very good food, and authentic Korean menu. The meal just felt a little rushed with starters brought out separately and mains before starters had been finished.

Would 100% eat here again.

76 Came here for lunch on a Saturday and had a great meal. Between the two of us we tried the pork gyozas, and basically had the BBQ. We chose the beer lamb, BBQ beef and the beef ribs. All very tender once on the BBQ, the ribs were a bit chewy though. Our bill came to around £40 and included two bowls of rice and some soft drinks. Overall, highly recommended if you're a beginner to Korean food. The only downside is that the ventilation isn't great so you do end up smelling like your food!

77 Poor service, staff cannot manage. Waited a long time to order in spite of calling out to staff. Apparently there is only one staff who can take order. After a long time she then came take the order of another group who came after us, when this was pointed out she said that she would need to ask her boss - who came first. Absolutely disgraceful. Needless to say we walked out. There are other Korean places to eat in Birmingham. Avoid.

78 Their pork BBQs are tender and delicious. But I really don't like the fact that we have to order extra for lettuces because lettuces are complimentary for Korean BBQ in most restaurants I have visited. Side dishes have to order separately and not free. Kimchi soup came with complimentary rice bowl though. The taste of other foods are quite okay but not as good as the one I went at Manchester. The decoration is nice and the staff is friendly. Only cash is accepted.

81 We wanted to go somewhere different as a family for Father's Day lunch and a friend recommended here. I always read reviews beforehand and so we knew about the cash situation and that service tended to be slow. We got there when it opened at noon and so service was not at all slow. We were the only customers for a while. It gave us time to ask lots of questions about the food and the numerous options. Two of us chose the cook yourself BBQ option and two had terryaki dishes. The beef terryaki was delicious and it was a novelty to cook on the grill. The rest of the food was good verging on ok. We didn't appreciate the additional 'tax' added onto the bill but had been very happy with our young waitress and the service she provided. Probably won't rush back but wouldn't rule it out either

82 Accept cash only, long waiting time, pricey compared to other Korean restaurant nearby , no ventilation at the shop
Bad customer service, we asked whether we could change our seating area cause the sun keep facing at my seating area. Been refused and no apologies.

We were so disappointed with this simple request as there were still plenty of seating table available at that time. We have to end up take away all our foods and went to somewhere else to have our dinner!!!

Would not recommend and would not ever go there again!!!

83 Me and a friend were feeling adventurous in trying out a new cuisine. We passed Miss Korea as an off chance. Thought we would try it. First up was the Korean tea...............very much an acquired taste too 'woody' for me. We ordered an appetizer to share (Belly Pork with Kimchi) which was rather a large dish. I felt it would have been better served with rice or noodles as it had a rich salty/ spicy taste to eat alone. The main courses were chicken Bibimbap and Seafood Udon Noodles. Both dishes were very tasty and filling. The bibimbap was an unusual dish as it is a very hot stone/ clay pot with rice at the bottom topped by vegetables and meat of your choice then a raw egg. The idea is to mix it all together before you eat it. Almost as if you are stir frying the dish!

Our waitress was very helpful and informative about the dishes we asked about. The downside was CASH only which we did not know until we asked for the bill.

84 Korean food seems to becoming more and more fashionable these days. I especially like how there are so many vegetarian/vegan options on offer at this restaurant and it was very clean and comfortable. The toilets are fun - a cat meows whenever you open the door! This type of quirkiness is what makes South East Asia so fascinating. My tofu was fantastic and just spicy enough. Staff were so cute and smiley too. We were the only white people in there which is a testament to how authentic this place is. We would definitely return the next time we are in Birmingham especially as the Hippodrome theatre is down the road.

85 I been coming to Miss Korea restaurant since late 2013 and every single time that I come here the food is consistent the standards are high the staff is friendly as well as helpful, there isn't much korean restaurants in Birmingham England this is a treat who want to try something different other than Chinese Japanese Indian or Thai food korean kimchi stew is very healthy kimchi itself is one of the healthiest foods on earth it based on fermentation of different vegetables the most popular one is with cabbage.

87 Bad food, even worse service. They only take cash due to evading tax probably. Ordered a lamb meal and it tasted gross. I barely touched it so I complained to the waitress and she could not speak much English and apologised but kept checking with the owner what they could do and all they could offer was 15% off our bill which is a complete rip off as my food arrived 30 mins after my friend has had his food. No apologies about this whatsoever. After a while, the owner came out very rude and arrogant saying they do not care if we don't like the taste of the food as to them it tastes okay. They tasted my leftovers as well. Wtf. Horrible experience. I will not be coming back ever. Probably will put a formal complaint as well after how we were treated.

88 1) lots of people seated = extremely slow service. It isn't bad, it is just slow. Once seated, wait 5-10 minutes for drinks order. Wait for drinks 5-10 minutes. Another 15-20 minutes wait for food order. Raw/BBQ yourself orders, will obviously get theirs quicker. Possibly another 25-30 minutes additional wait for the cooked food. We opted for all cooked, so first 2 people ate theirs whilst other 2 watched, once finished, still a wait before the other 2 people were even served.

2) food was tasty and portions we thought were good

3) cash only

4) there are separate booths and tables for 4, the row of tables down the centre all squeezed together, so you may be next to strangers. The seats are comfy and the atmosphere is lively, and you will likely be socialising with your own company anyway

5) you/your clothes/coats will come out smelling of BBQ/oil/grease/chilli etc. The vents up above in the ceiling might not be doing anything useful at all

Would recommend going if you have lots of time, want to try different flavours on your palate and/want a different experience of cooking whilst socialising and eating.

Next time we come, we'll choose our clothes wisely.

90 Had a good night here with the family. Kimchi was spicy and delicious. On the BBQ the spicy pork was our favourite. Soups had lots of flavour. Prices were fine, not cheap but no big shock when bill arrived. Negatives; there is no extraction system so the place is full of bbq smoke, clothes will smell after; and like other reviewers noted the service charge is hidden. It is put on the bill as tax rather than service and the waitresses are vague when ask them if service is already included or not. It is.

91 Had a lovely bowl of bibbimap, full of flavour. Excellent starters too. Quick efficient service. We did come out smelling of oil though! It lacks a bit of atmosphere, but I don't mind that - we only wanted a quick bowl of something - we weren't looking for a full on dining experience. Worth popping by if you're in the area.

93 This was my first visit for quite a while and since it has been refurbished. Mid evening on a Friday night we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The new grills seemed easy to use and the waitress fired it up as soon as we ordered. We piled in with beef, prawns, omelette, seafood tempura and kimchi. It was great watching our prawns and beef griddle while we supped on beer and Korean tea (which has overtones of vanilla). We got lettuce with the beef (which made it great to make beef, barbecue sauce and kimchi parcels). The omelette/pancake was every bit as good as I had hoped after seeing Judy Joo make one on a TV programme. The prawn, fish and vegetable tempura were delicious, crispy with firm flesh and even better when dipped in soy sauce. The kimchi.was really fiery. There was far too much to eat but they kindly boxed the leftovers for us. The waitresses are friendly and efficient. It surprises me that so few brummies visit this place: most of the clientele were oriental. The food is delicious and £56 was not too bad considering how much we ordered. With parking just across the road I don't know why you haven't visited. Highly recommended.

97 We visited this place one year ago and left unimpressed then. This time we arrived as a group of four for our meal and after ordering our food, service initially started very well. We got our drinks and the dishes started to arrive but after some time we were ignored. Our requests for drinks were ignored and after the first 3-4 dishes we ordered we had to wait 15-20 mins for the remainder of the dishes to arrive. It was then we noticed that the place wasn't that busy but they were serving dishes to the other tables that had arrived after us. The BBQ and seafood pancake was delicious and the bibimbap and teriyaki eel was passable. But the worst of all was the soft tofu stew. It was nothing like we had ever tried before. It was lacking in flavour and was more like a clear soup with bits of tofu, cucumber and one egg in it. At the end, when we asked for the bill we were also slapped with a 10% TAX at the end for poor service. We didn't complain but this is one place we will definitely not be coming back to.

Keep in mind, this place serves BBQ but has no ventilation system installed so it also becomes very stuffy and smoky. You will definitely leave the place smelling of BBQ and smoke.

98 Heard about this place quite a while ago and I've heard good reviews so decided to take a visit with the family. Not much of a big place and the food was okay. Quite overrated. Service took a while. Mains came before the starters? And even when we've finished our mains the starters still hasn't come out. They forgot our orders and the staff seemed disorientated. Some of the bbq meat were good and the rest were taste less. Seafood platter was okay. Fresh. The potato, pumpkin veg platter came out after we had the meat and seafood platter so we sat there eating grilled veg. The spicy fried chicken was really good and the decor of the restaurant is pretty but apart from that it was mediocre.

99 I don't get why some of this cluster of restaurants can be so empty on a Saturday night while others are brimmed. Anyway, this place is in the latter category and it's easy to see why. I've never been to Korea so I can't vouch for the authenticity, but it's well worth a visit. The staff are very helpful and happy to walk you around the dishes. This is quite useful as some of the dishes a either quite spicy or served raw. They're also happy to anglosise a dish for you too, if what they're serving is a bit weird for you. Every table is equipped with a barbecue grill too, and this looks fun. I'm not sure where some of the "expensive" reviews come from on TA. 34 quid for 2 people with sides, drinks and starters is pretty good (what do you want for your money??) and the service was excellent, especially for a busy Saturday night. Cash only!

100 I wish I had written a review on here a long time ago, first I have to address the Pearson who claims that Miss Korea restaurant is racist nothing could be further from the truth the people who owned Miss Korea restaurant are a interracial couple, I been dining here nearly three years and as a black Pearson I had nothing but excellent service at Miss Korea restaurant and been here today is no different the other diners are very well behaved.

The food at Miss Korea is delicious very healthy for the first time I tried cold buckwheat noodles and it was very nice, the old saying is don't knock it until you tried.
I want to move to South Korea if the food at Miss Korea restaurant is to go by please ignore the negative comment about it racist and unfriendly staff that Pearson who wrote that isn't a regular where as I am.

Staff don't understand English well, I asked to serve my main course after BBQ but they brought all out at the same time. And right when we were about to finish BBQ, lettuce leaves were out to the table!

I would have been better off eating in a top restaurants in Birmingham with what I paid!

104 Bad service !!! Miss Korea the worse restaurant ever!!!! Which I walked out a restaurant first time in my life !!!!!
Been there before they refurnished.
Just been in again after long time, only few tables and not busy at all. Very rude staff who don't even be bother answer question and smile and gave you an awkward face constantly; took her 2 seconds to repeat the order, which don't even allow you to ask her to repeat again!
She claimed herself as Manager which I don't believe she is and I openly said to her "well you obviously failed your life and will stuck here forever! "
Then I just walked out a restaurant for the first time in my life.
Very very bad restaurant! Strongly not recommend anyone to go there, it will totally ruin your night out!!!!

105 Toppoki was full so went here. The smell of cooking hit me as I went in and there was a smokey haze in the place. All the tables were full so we were asked to wait at a table and given menus. The service was ok and the food was nice but there were a lot of people barbecuing and the atmosphere got thicker and thicker. When we left all the windows were steamed up and the smoke haze was quite thick. Don't go here in decent clothes or before going on to an event.

Live barbecue was lovely,, all food were very delicious and portion sizes are good. We all enjoyed a lot. Lovely place,, could do a better in service.We were not even asked how our food was in the entire meal sessioin, but still charged extra as a service charge or don't know what, it only said tax.. but if you charge extra for the service, you have to up your game in sevice, I felt so. Ovderall. very good food, will be back soon.

108 Used to go here a lot but then found Toppoki, which we like. Toppoki was rammed last night so decided to venture further down the road again and I'm glad we did! MK has been refurbished and is very smart. The waiting staff certainly aren't Korean but the service was warm and friendly. The food was top notch - we really enjoyed the BBQ and bibimbap was super tasty. Only criticism would be lack of extraction in the restaurant. The new BBQs don't give off much smoke (now electric and not coal as before) but when they do smoke, the only answer is for them to open the door!

109 Lots of options in the area, interesting place, where you can cook your own meat under the barbeque section. I tried the beef which comes raw in a hot pot, you stir it and the more you do the more the beef gets cooked in the heat. Something different to what I've had anywhere before, the food was decent, I tried the eel also which was tasty.

111 A friend and I had never eaten Korean before, and wandered into Miss Korea on the off chance we would enjoy it. The restaurant itself is not the poshest in the world, and if you're looking for intimacy then it's not really the place for you, but it is nicely decorated, the seats are comfortable and there's a friendly hubbub atmosphere. The waiting staff were friendly and accommodating, there was a wait for food but it was explained to us before we ordered so we didn't mind too much.
The food itself was tasty - we shared dumplings and edamame to start, then had black bean pork and noodles and bibimbap with a side of bean sprouts for main. It was tasty. With the exception of the bibimbap which came in it's own hot bowl, the food wasn't as hot as I would expect - but that's not to say it was unpleasant. (A lot of the menu is meat which you have to cook yourself on a built in grill on the table so I guess if you ordered that then your food would be super hot)
The reason the review is 4* and not 5* is that at the back of the restaurant there is some kind of function room or bar area, which generated a lot of loud noise throughout our dining experience, also, where we were sat was directly opposite the door and every time anyone went in or out the door stays open so we were repeatedly having to ask for the door to be closed as it was really cold. I understand the weather can't be helped and there are limited seats, we hadn't booked, so our table was probably one of the worst positions and if we had only had to ask once for the door to be closed I wouldn't mention it - it was the fact that even though the staff knew we were cold when the door was open and were stood and could clearly see (and feel) the door was open, they waited for us to ask before they closed it.
Overall though, a good experience.

112 Celebrating a friends birthday so a small group. Keen to try something new we went for a set menu consisting of starters and main followed by ice cream. Starters was soup followed by something similar to dim sum. This was lovely and there was plenty of it. Then came main course which consists of various meats, vegetables and sauces which you cook for yourself using the hot plate in the centre of the table - think fondue style. Bit of a novelty factor which soon wore off as I eat out for someone to cook for me! Good to try/experience but if I went again I'd get something else. All of the food was lovely though.

114 i gave this place a try as the other Korean restaurant 'Toppokki' across the road in china town seemed too busy. The food was absolute garbage from the frozen breaded prawn starters to a kimchi stew which tasted hideous, I felt like i could taste tomato ketchup in the soup. The service was pretty appalling, had to go out of my way to get the attention of the waitress who was frowning the entire evening. No authenticity, horrible tasteless bland food which is nothing like Korean home cooked food, poor service. If only I could give zero ratings.

115 In a nutshell:

Food and soups were all plain and bland.
Staff were not the friendliest.
Restaurant suits couples and large groups, I would encourage a family dining here.
Ventilation is a major issue in that place.
Price is not relative to the food quality nor dining experience.

Very disappointed and will probably stick to Topokki, that's just round the corner on Hurst St (check out my review on them too).

Wouldn't recommend at all.

117 This has been a good place for tasty food and I have visited it on a number of occasions in the past. However, of late there is something wrong with their ventilation, which really affects the dining experience and what comes after it.

After a busy week I thought I'd take the evening off and eat out to save time and work, but ended up having to throw all of my clothes, including my coat and my backpack, into the wash. I left the restaurant smelling very strongly of food due to the lack of air circulation and extraction. Also, the floor tiles were so slippery that I nearly fell over, which says something as I was wearing sensible shoes with non-slip Vibram soles. Other customers were similarly shuffling and sliding along in their sneakers to avoid slipping.

Overall good food, but not a relaxing experience and it created far more work than if I had stayed at home and cooked for myself.

118 Have been there for several times and really love the food. Be ready to wait for the food because it took ages for the food to come (except barbecue).

It has been a year since its reopening but they still accept cash only!!! This is very annoying because they used the same "excuse" every time which was that "there is a problem with the card machine connection to the server at the moment "!!! Come on! I've been to the restaurant around 10 times since their reopening last year and they explained the Cash Only thing with the same excuse every time!!

How could a card machine out of order for more than one year!? Because they never actually use the card machine!! Perhaps they're lying because of some particular reasons.

However, the food is good. Hope it would accept card payments as soon as possible.

119 I took my family last Friday evening for my anniversary meal - something different I thought because we always go to Cafe Soya which I must say is excellent. All started off well, waitress was friendly & explained the different meals. We ordered & then we waited 35 minutes for drinks & then our meals came 1 after the other - my wife's first after 50 minutes them mine 10 minutes later & my children then waited a further 10 minutes for their meals. It's not as if we ordered anything out of the ordinary. It's was very annoying knowing my children were hungry & me & my wife had our meals eventually but they still hadn't had theirs. The waitress said there was a mix up with the order which I couldn't understand because everything was from their menu & numbered. How easy could it be - the place wasn't busy so there was no excuse at all & the apologising during our meal got very irritating - too cap it off the waitress apologised again & then said they wouldn't charge the 10 % service charge. We couldn't wait too get out of there & would never return - the food is okay, the portions are mediocre & the prices are expensive for what it is but I will emphasise I will keep to what I know & stick ' Cafe Soya' in the future

122 We went as friends recommended it and Trip Advisor suggested it was good. No. Poor service, with incomplete meals and the quality of the food - some of it self-cooked at the table - was different. Expensive for what we had: £75 for four, with a drink each and one course.
Note the bill includes a 10% service charge.

124 First time I've had a Korean meal, came across this place on TripAdvisor and read the reviews as protocol. The place was only 30metres from where I was so took a look with my own eyes. When it comes to eating out, the number one thing that friends ask me is, "where can I get good Indian food?" (I'm of Indian origin) and my answer is always the same, "wherever you see Indian people eating". I followed my own advice and opted to dine at Miss Korea as this is where Koreans were eating. They have the raw menu where you can cook your own meat on the built in grill on your table, like a self serve teppan yaki but my friends and I opted for the cooked choices. We enjoyed a smokey chicken teriyaki sizzling on the iron plate, the sweet and spicy chicken, veg noodles and the some of the crispiest tempura in a light and fresh batter. Sides of cucumber relish and kimchi. To not cloud the flavour we stuck with water as it was our first experience of Korean cuisine. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal and at the end we took guesses as to the bill, it came in under a third under our estimates! Full of flavour and excellent value, goes to show you have to try things and make your own opinions.

127 We had high hopes and expectation for the place and it did not disappoint us at all. The flavours were good and we loved the BBQ dishes we have been craving for. We ordered a portion of the raw beef (Yuk Hwae) and wow! Thanks to other reviewers, we were dressed prepared for the smoky BBQ environment and had we not been warned, we would have been pretty annoyed if we had turned up in our Sunday best only to find we needed to literally strip as we walked into our home and everything went into the wash and bodies in the shower! However, if you are prepared, it really is worth it. The only criticism is the "excuse" of the card machine being "still" out of order, we wondered if it had ever worked. We thought it would have given a better impression to simply state cash only up front as it would not deter us from eating there again at all. The food itself is enough to draw in customers.

128 Seen this from day one for a few years.... shopfront looks good.... but find it hard to appreciate the experience and food

First thing .... The food is a bit pricey.... If you want the grill..... It can be a bit expensive... Korea food seems to be a growing trend nowadays. ... but not really for me.....

Food is okay and will not blow you mind.....

Ventilation could be a lot better.... With many tables grilling.... you end up coming out with your clothes smelling of oil...... similar to my Friday night at the local kebab shop....

129 Having just returned for South Korea I can say this place is a great traditional restaurant

The service was perfect and the food was delicious.

We had some Korean BBQ, kimchi and all the trimmings you would expect with Korean.

Even has Korean beers and soju (highly recommend to go with your food)

130 Wonderful authentic Kimchi and glass noodles and table BBQ is great fun if you don't mind smelling a bit smokey after. Decor and service are excellent but loos were a bit messy on my visit.

131 The best thing about this restaurant is the bbq at the table, it is worth a visit just for that reason as is unusually, food we orderd from the menu was ok lacked flavour certainly the soup. we felt other foods was slightly over priced for the lacking quality in the menu food, however the staff were friendly and the area was clean and tidy, not sure we would visit again.

132 Today, I was craving for Korean food for lunch. And so, after my friend's recommendation and all the positive reviews, I've decided to hive Miss Korea a try. It was the only reason why I went to the city centre today and I was excited.

Upon entering the restaurant, I've noticed the nice yet simple decor. I find it very cosy. I was greeted with a "hello" by the waitress, I sat and checked on the menu that looks sumptuous. I was very hungry I couldn't wait to order and feast.

It took quite a few minutes before my order was taken even though it was quiet today. I've ordered for kimchi, jap chae and beef Bulgogi bibimbap. Come the drinks, I asked for korean tea. However I was told that their bar is closed. Ok, I opt for Sprite with loads of ice. But then, I was told they have no ice! At this point,miss a starting to feel a bit annoyed. Alright then, I can do without ice.

I stood up to go to the toilet and the waitress had another news for me. There is no light in the toilet and even said that if I want, I can use my mobile phone as a light! How unacceptable! By this time, I've already lost my appetite. Closed bar, no ice then no
light in the toilet. To top it all, I was told they only accept cash payment as their card machine is broken! What an appalling service I got today. That broken card machine has been their issue for quite some time now! Does it really take long to fix it? I've told the waitress that it has been terrible experience I've had with them today.

And since my appetite has already been spoilt, I left the restaurant without tasting their food. I'm not even sure if I would come back to try it. I was very disappointed. And quite frankly, I don't care if a restaurant's food is good, if the service is bad then I shall never go back nor will I recommend it to any of my friends.

I ended up in Toppoki which is just on the other side and I've enjoyed their food very much.

133 We popped here for dinner and the food was all lovely. Teriyaki salmon and beef and gyoza and spicy chicken to start. A watermelon juice was also very refreshing. Only problem is the bbq makes you smell of cooking when you leave, maybe better ventilation would help?

We went to miss Korea in Birmingham, for the first time to see what Korean food was really like. We ordered a range of starters and main courses which included bbq beef marinaded in beer which you was have to grill yourself. Also thier was raw beef bin bargan which tasted lovely. The selection of starters and mains were excellent. The service was good. Food came to moderate timings, the drinks were lovely and light, I went for Korean crushed pear drink which tasted excellent and fizzy. The atmosphere was comfortable.

135 we decided to have lunch and my boyfriend suggested this place. it was both our first time, as soon as we get in the restaurant is very modern and clean. i like that it looks like a very chill place to have lunch to. our waitress gave us this massive menu and decided to go for their lunch menu. as soon as our food arrived it exceeded my expectations, it had a wonderful presentation and was very delicious. the price is very good too and i will definitely come back. next time i will try the korean bbq.
only down side i think is you stink a bit of bbq cos of other tables cooking, wouldnt recommend going to this place if heading out after.

136 I have missed Samgyupsal since leaving Korea. So far, this is the best restaurant that I have found serving this dish. I have been a few times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I was shocked at paying for my side dishes after having lived the Korean way where this is all free, but the price was worth it. Would definitely go again!

137 I can honestly say this is the best Korean food I have had in Birmingham! However they need to sort out there air system as you stink of food when you leave! GET an extraction system in place!

Also been here a few months ago and still the credit card issue remains... They keep saying the system doesn't work... Seems to me they don't want to pay the card machine fees?! It's 2015 people get a grip!!!!

Other than this I still love this place! The food is excellent and the service is friendly! This is my third time back!

138 Two meats, beautifully marinaded, one in beer, the other sweet. Great kimchi too. Service faultless as before. Unhurried Sat afternoon meal, with just enough to eat. If you're confused what to order, the staff give great advice. Fast becoming a favourite place to eat.

139 Nice place with friendly staff. A good choice of menu options including korean bbq or dishes that are ready cooked. We opted for rice based dishes plus a selection of vegetable starters which were all tasty. This was our first Korean restaurant and the spicy fried chicken with rice is definitely a dish I would want again. Not expensive and very generous portions. I've no doubt we'll be back.

141 Having eaten Korean before, on a visit to Hong Kong. I knew roughly what to expect. Marinated meat dishes to be cooked on a hot grill thing in the centre of the table and Kimchi, the ubiquitous Korean cabbage pickle. And so it was! Delicious! Must go back!

142 Had heard great things about this place and the menu had us drooling. When we arrived the staff were welcoming and there was a nice buzz to the place. We ordered a drink whilst we waited for our pals but by the time they had joined us and finished their drink too, we had to leave. Unfortunately we were overwhelmed by the odour.

The problem is that this place is Korean BBQ, so you cook your own food at the table. Sounds like a great idea but not when there is little or no ventilation. We were there for less than 30mins but our clothes stank of fried food / oil for the rest of the night.

Considering this is a fairly new venue, it is not going to smell any better with time, especially with the wood paneling and cloth covered chairs. A commercial kitchen is not allowed to open without proper ventilation so I have no idea how this place remains open without the same in the dining room.

Such a shame !!

143 I love Korean food so much and Korean BBQ in particular. We went here a little tipsy and left more that satisfied. I had a gochujang marinated pork dish which I had to barbecue on the in--table grill. My wife had a huge bibimbap with giant pieces of tofu on top and our friend visiting from the USA had a authentic kimchi and tofu soup (sundubu chiggae). Incredible food experience!

144 My boyfriend and I discovered this gem last week. We had a set menu as Korean food is not familiar to us and it was fabulous (the seafood one). We both thoroughly enjoyed it and I've been recommending it to all our friends in the area. Well worth a visit! Finally something a bit different and I love the grills in the tables!!!

145 This new restaurant provides to my mind authentic Korean flavours and dining experiences. I am no expert but have a little knowledge of Korean food having visited the country about 20 times. I was told that the chef is Korean and this was borne out in the flavours I enjoyed in my lunchtime Bulgogi Bibimpap a few days ago.

The melon juice was typical of the kinds of accompaniment one enjoys with Korean food, and the kimchee (pickled spicy cabbage) really did take me back to a country I have enjoyed visiting over many years.

The restaurant was very quiet when we viisted but this was just before the start of the university terms in Nottingham. Nottingham's 60,000 new and returning students (or at any rate some of them) no doubt will give the place a bit of atmosphere shortly.

There was only one (non-Korean) waitress serving when we visited, but this no doubt reflects the fact that we were there at lunchtime, at a quiet time of the week. I would say however that the confident manner in which Korean waiters and waitresses serve and talk about the food it is their job to bring to you is another very nice aspect of restaurants in Korea. If this place can manage it it should hire some Korean waiting staff it would provide even more genuineness in the dining experience.

The only thing I really quibble however with is the name of the restaurant. Viewed either as referring to a yearning for visiting Korea or to a beauty pageant, it is slightly cheesy. Something that speaks to you of Korea's ancient culture in my view would be more appropriate. This is a small reservation about a generally good restaurant that I intend to visit again.

147 The service is one of the worse. I even questioned myself what had I done to make the waitress treat my table with so much hatred, but I guess she did that to every customer. She didnot say a word or understand anything we asked. She gave us cold stares. The food is no where compare to Toppoki, the other korean restaurant. I think because the chefs are not koreans. My friends live near the restaurant, its the only reason we came there so often. The size was small, pricey and not authentic. The best dish is bibimbap, that is the only compliment I can give

148 My second visit to a hidden treasure Nice modern decor without being ostentatious. I love the barbecues recessed into each table allowing customers to cook their own food. You can't get any fresher than that. Vegetable dumplings, vegetable fritters and squid in spicy sauce followed by pork, squid and prawns cooked on the barbecue. Fantastic quality food at a very reasonable price. Definitely one to check out and try again. Bring lots of friends

149 As other reviews have said, the waiting service is poor. This is mainly down to the poor attitude of the waitress with glasses. There were several scenarios where arguments nearly broke out. The food is average and I've had better in London. They do not have space for you to put buggies and it ends up near the door. I did't feel comfortable with this.

150 I came down to Birmingham for the day (from London) for business reasons and was craving some Korean food after a hard days work, but had no idea on where I could get some. So then I contacted a few friends who resided in the city and asked for recommendations, which then later they brought me to "Miss Korea".

When we first stepped into the restaurant we weren't greeted, my first impression of the interior was that it was immaculate and bold. However, it was quite smokey inside as there was an open kitchen but also meat being grilled on some customers table tops, but that was understandable. After being noticed a few minutes later we were then seated and decided to order:
3 portions of bulgogi
1 portion of la Galbi
1 portion of lettuce
2 portions of kimchi cabbage
1 portion of seasoned spinach
1 portion of dukbokki
1 portion of rice
1 portion o fkimchi fried rice
and 4 drinks

The food was of good quality but had it's flaws, such as the dukbokki was quite over cooked which resulted in a really mushy texture, the kimchi fried rice was quite on the dry side and also the portions were quite small compared to the price. But that wasn't the problem, the real problem was the staff and service. Firstly, the female staff who was serving us was sulking for some reason and seemed like she didn't want to serve us. Her attitude towards us, was like she didn't care about anything and just wanted to go home. After our order was taken, we had to wait rather long for our food to arrive and then when it finally arrived some dishes were missing. For example the meats arrived but the lettuce and rice were nowhere to be found and it seemed that the waitress had forgotten about them. Which then I reminded her and she said, I quote "okay" and left. No apology whatsoever. When we nearly finished the meat, she then brings out the rice and lettuce and still no apology. With then we decided to just finish quickly and leave as we didn't felt welcomed.

The food was of good standard but the price was a bit of the high side. The staff and service however was the final killing blow that assured me to never come back to this restaurant and try else where.

151 I went there with my friend on friday night. Not busy much that time. No greeting at the entrance. But i can accept that. As soon as we sat down, the waitress came and lay out the cutlery. My phone was on the table & she just pushed the phone away to put the napkin on the table. I was really surprised by her attitude and she noticed that too. But NO APOLOGY. Not at all !!
(Hint: dont know her name. But there's only one girl with the band hair in front, wearing gold necklace)

152 I can totally understand the service complaints. As it is sometimes a hit and miss! However the Food is amazing, we go so much the lady in the kitchen starts cooking our soup before we've even ordered!! Amazing. I would say the Male Owner can add a bad vibe in there. The girls are much better when his absent. My review is based on the food which we love, and the girls do a great job as well as the chefs. Little Gem in birmingham

153 This was my first experience with Korean food, and I was excited to go since my friends hyped up Miss Korea to me the night before. I have heard of bulgogi and kimchi, and always wanted to try them, so I was looking forward to the trip.

Upon arrival, we were seated at a table for four people (with five of us). The grill also appeared to be broken. It took ten minutes of nervous whispering and attempting to flag down the waiting staff for us to be moved to a bigger table with a working grill.

The ordering felt rushed and we had to send away the waitress as we didn't feel ready, and when she came back we had to rush a decision out of a feeling of awkwardness. I was then told by a friend who had been here before that their kimchi is not authentic at all, and would be a disappointment, so I decided to forego it. The food itself took a really long time to arrive, with the first main arriving close to fifteen minutes before the last. I found the starter (sadly I forgot the name, it looks like a deep fried pancake folded in half over some filling) and my main (bulgogi chicken with veg and rice in a hot stone bowl) generally bland and even a tad sickening in taste. The only redeeming quality of the main was the meat, which was delicious, but scarce. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the beef bulgogi and beer marinated beef that we could grill ourselves. They were absolutely delicious, but too felt like very little meat for £6+ per plate.

As another review points out, the service is terrible. The waiting staff pay no attention to what goes around them (we had to raise our voice to borderline shouting in order to get their attention from a meter away), the two waitresses seem very timid and even scared. Another lady, who appears to be their manager, has a very hostile air about her, made no effort to seem welcoming when talking to us and berated the two girls in the plain view of customers. When they do appear, the waitresses would come to the table, take the utensils and stir the meat on the grill after seeing you do it, before walking off without a word? Empty plates were not taken away from the table through the meal and once again the staff had to be almost shouted to in order to tell them that we would like our bill.

Overall, I wasn't very impressed with the restaurant apart from the novelty of the grill, which I did enjoy. As far as I understand the food isn't very authentic, and isn't a great representation of quality of Korean food. The service is poor and I felt like I overpaid for the little food that I did eat. I told my friends I stopped eating because I had enough and wasn't hungry any more, whichever as true enough, but the cause of that was a lack of appetite, and not a full stomach. The only reason I can see myself coming back to Miss Korea is for the grill meats, and exclusively that.

154 Came to Miss Korea on the recommendation of a good friend who accompanied me. Nice modern decor without being ostentatious. My friend chose the menu and I was very pleased. The starters of chicken dumplings and fried vegetables were nice and the edamame fresh but it was when the table top cooker was opened up and I was presented with freshly lightly fried pork, squid, prawns, mussels and salmon I realised how good the cuisine was. All of this at a bargain price. I shall come back again

155 We ordered seafood bibimbap (my favourite, it has a special type of sauce in it, which adds so much to the flavour), deep fried tofu in sweet chilli sauce, kimchi pork, kimchi starter, spinach starter.
All dishes are amazing, very healthy, fresh food, spicy enough bit bot to blow one's mind off.
Highly recommended, my favourite Korean restaurant in whole Birmingham.

157 Miss Korea is a breath of fresh air in Birmingham. It has great food and brings a uniqueness to the Far Eastern cuisine scene in nearby Chinatown. I have been here before with my husband last year and I would recommend it. The decor is simple- modern and black. The staff are very friendly and the food was delicious.

158 We found ourselves in Miss Korea during the Sunday Chinese celebrations of the New Year (Horse). The food was good enough for us to eat it all however, not memorable. This maybe due to our love of Vietnamese food and expected more flavors, rather than Miss Korea's food itself.

159 Ignore the haters (lot of them their first review - seems a bit fishy to me...). After discovering Miss Korea on a whim with a friend last November we have been twice more. Everytime we have had no problem getting tap water, though usually alongside other drinks. The BBQ stuff is awesome, the beef with ginger and soy is great. The service is quiet and efficent, which is the way I personally like it. Miss Korea is one of my favourite spots to eat currently, don't see that changing anytime soon...

160 Location - Central, directly opp Arcadian car park

Atmosphere - V friendly staff, really welcoming it's quite modern but as though it's been done on the cheap so I wouldn't recommend as a romantic venue.

Food - I had never tried Korean food and enjoyed the different flavours. We didn't go for anything in the BBQ menu (where the meat is cooked at your table) but wish we had given it a try.

All in all, nice flavours, fresh food, a tad greasy - give it a try!

161 me and my friends have a meal there, we order barbecue, the table is very small, the waitress who has the black with a stink face to order and service us. No smile no more words to introduce food.I found that the plate is very oily, I ask for tap water, but the staff said they don't provide tap water to Chinese. but the manager is Chinese. After dinner, we want to paid separately, pay cash and card together, the staff said we can't paid card less than 30 pound. the manager seems not happy to see us trouble her coz the bill. when we went out, our coats are smelly, Their kitchen is opened no window .

162 Having read some of the reviews, we were quite anxious about eating at Miss Korea, but we needn't have been. The service was thoughtful and help was offered but not pushed. The friends we went with had been several times before. I really enjoyed the dish I had with eel, as did one of our friends. My partner had a beef dish and the other friend had tofu. The kimchi and other side dish were very spicy but delicious and gave us something to nibble before our main dishes arrived. Drinks were good too - I had a soya drink, one friend had beer and the two men shared a spirit which, whilst good at the time had rather an unfortunate hangover as an after effect. Probably best avoided! We were not hustled or harassed and were able to enjoy a very happy evening chatting and enjoying good food. We'll definitely return and hope to try some of the other dishes next time. Thank you miss Korea.

164 me and my wife visit Birmingham to shop at the Korean restaurant in Selly Oak then like to have a meal out somewhere. we found this place through tripadvisor. First time we went all seemed ok a little expensive for what is kimbab cheonguk meals but barring that food was ok. Went again today and food was of average quality and prices for the dishes seemed more expensive. we ordered food and drinks including a seafood pancake which was way too small also the portions of bibbimbap were too small even my son (10 years old) complained of being still hungry after the meal. Biggest shock was getting the bill 3 pounds for water and 2 pounds for a glass of warm sprite that had been served out of a 2 litre bottle from the supermarket.
Seriously!!! having lived and worked in Korea for 6 years I know that you will never attain the same service standards as there, but saying that, charging for water in a Korean restaurant......
As a lover of Korean food I wont be going again. Sorry!!!

165 I thought we'd give this place a try having been to two other Korean bbq restaurants in the area of town, looks okay from the outside and it wasn't busy plus the menu looked nice in the window.
We were quickly seated and set about choosing our food - there is a good bbq selection but I fancied something different so we chose a couple of starters, a side, two mains and an extra. This didn't take too long but then the waiting began.
There were two other couples and a table of around ten guys who were doing their own bbq and didn't need much assistance. The kitchen seemed well staffed, two girls serving but one was also doing the bar and the manageress was easily spotted in the kitchen too.
More waiting.........
I haven't even been asked what I want to drink yet.
More waiting.........
Im getting impatient and annoyed now but I am still being ignored by the serving staff.
Okay now I'm angry and I decided in one minute I am going to get up and walk out.
45 seconds in I get served!. We order everything and it doesn't take too long to come - it all comes at different times and overall the food was very nice, couldn't fault it.
but then the waiting starts again........
Ive finished my drink and want another, I even position the empty glass to the side of the table near the servers but it doesn't happen.
I wouldn't mind some dessert too but im still sat around waiting and getting impatient again and eventually I announce '*$%% it' and get up, pay and leave.
Luckily you pay at the counter and don't ask the waitress for a bill otherwise I would of been there much longer.

They missed out on me having another couple of beers and trying the Korean rice wine plus a couple of desserts. I wont go back again - I did think about venting my anger at the manageress but she just looks at you from the kitchen and doesn't give any direction to waiting staff.
If it was busy then god help anyone wanting to get served.
I had to go somewhere else for pudding and a few beers and I wont go there again. There are much better Korean restaurants in the quarter so I would give Miss Korea a big miss.

166 After sharing a room with several Korean ladies, my daughter has a love for Korean culture, especially the food!

We try and find a good Korean food when ever we travel together, and closer to home as often as we can. A weeks holiday and a rainy day was a good excuse to try out Miss Korea, a BBQ style place close to the cinema.

The decor is minimalistic, with stainless steel and chrome predominated. The food and staff were Korean (so my daughter said). Despite being a busy Sunday lunchtime we were seated quickly. The menus are in Korean and English, and coded (in case you don't want to try and pronounce the names) with colour pictures to give you an idea of what to expect.

A complementary small portion of spicy korean salad to start with was a good start.

We ordered KIMCHI CHIGAE and BULGOGI DOLSOT BIBIMBAB and both of those were excellent. My soup came bubbling hot, and was full of flavour and spicy. Rice was included. I would also recommend the jugs of fruit juice. The mango we had was great!

It was good food at a good price (under £30 for a meal with drinks and a starter). A chain worth supporting...

167 I have been to Miss Korea twice. I have also been to Seoul (South Korea) for long periods of time (my best friend lives their). Many of the dishes are indeed authentic so people who say otherwise don't on trip adviser don't really know what they are talking about! Nice friendly restaurant with BBQ facility in the center of each table allowing you to cook your own meal if you so desire. Its not a 5* restaurant so don't walk in there with high expectations of glitz and glamour, or outstanding Ritz table service. The prices are reasonable and the service is absolutely fine. I cannot understand such negative reviews from others? God knows what these other people expect? Anyway you cant please everyone but this restaurant certainly pleases me each time I go. Looking forward to my next trip there. Angelo, Sutton Coldfield.

169 I went last year when they first opened and had a very bad experience. The wait for being served was long and the food came separately which caused us to eat at separate times.
We went this time thinking the service would have improved by now but it hasn't. We were shown to the table after 5 minutes by the waitress whereas the owner chose to stand behind the bar watching. The first dish came half an hour later and still no sign of drinks. It was busy so it was understandable that the food would take awhile but we ordered around half 7 and only just had the main dishes served around half 8/9. The bbq was turned off so we asked the owner to check for us and then he told us the bbq on this table was broke and and he asked us to moved, I questioned him why it took them so long to let us know that and he blamed it on the waitress, he asked the waitresses and she confirmed that it wasn't brokenand then he pushed her away and got the kitchen to cook our meat inside. Overall it wasn't a very nice experience mainly because of the wait, service and also the food doesn't taste as good as Toppoki.

170 We decided to try this place for lunch on a quick trip to Birmingham. There were four of us. Our waitress was very helpful, explaining and recommending dishes. We had a selection of appetisers, some meat that we bbq'd in the pit on the table, a broth dish and teriyaki salmon. I have no idea how authentic it is but it was all delicious. The gyoza were better than wagamama. The other dishes were interesting and made a change from Chinese/Japanese/Thai. There was plenty of food but not too much. It came to £61 which I thought was good value, we only had soft drinks. Only point to improve was that the ladies loo could have been a bit cleaner.

171 Miss Korea is a small, but smart looking little restaurant. There is a detailed menu and lots to choose from. It sounds like some people have had a bad experience, but really in my eyes it was very positive. The menu offers great choice but doesn't give you too much support if you're not familiar with Korean cuisine, that said it compared favourably to my previous experience with Korean restaurants. The food was quick, well presented, seasoned and flavoured and good value. The drinks a little more expensive but not out of sync with other restaurants. We didn't have any experience with the tap water, but in fairness to them at least they're up front about it. The service was attentive, no waiting at all to be helped, there was no checking-in on your enjoyment during the meal which is a little unusual but really not an issue for me. I would go again and would be happy to recommend it to others too.

173 We were going to see Sleeping Beauty at The Hippodrome so wanted a quick but tasty pre theatre dinner. Spotted this on way into Arcadian car park and thought we would give if a go. Restaurant had plenty of Korean customers and we were the only Europeans but we were made to feel very welcome. Staff were very helpful and we had three starters and two mains including a deep fried tofu starter and a spicy pork stew with kimche the pickled cabbage that seems to be very important to their cuisine. We also had a glass of white wine and an iced lemon tea. The food was delicious Anf plentiful and the bill was £29! Sorry to see some people had a bad experience here, ours was fantastic and I can't wait to try it again.

174 I used to like this restaurant until today. I've been to "Miss Korea" more than 5 times in the past 1 years, I like the food although it's a bit over-priced. Today me and my wife ordered 4 dishes, a ice cream and a coke, everything is ok until I have the bill, there're 2 more drinks on the bill(Strawberry milk shake& J2O papaya, totally 6 pounds) which we never ordered, in the meanwhile there's only one big empty cup on our table.

I asked waitress, she realized immediately before I told her what happened. She then went to modify bill and bring the correct bill back without a apology. She seems not very happy about we checked bill carefully and found out what they did to our bill. I asked some of my Chinese friend, they have the same experience of be given wrongly-calculated bill. I think they're doing this on purpose, because what they add into bills are drinks, which are their most profitable things in menu.

As people already mentioned before: they don't serve tap water. why? as far as I can tell, a big part of their profit are from drinks. if you have a tap water which is free, they earn nothing from their over-priced drink. eg: a Korean grape drink, in "Miss Korea" 2.5 quid, in 100 feet-away Chinese convenience store: 50p. Now maybe you can see the reason why they don't serve any tap water.

Avoid this restaurant. if you can't, be prepared that there won't be any tap water served. Carefully check your bill.

Pro: the food was ok.

Con: Serve no tap water, Add drinks which you never ordered to bill stealthily

175 I travel to Korea often on business so am fairly familiar with authentic Korean food. I was looking forward to eating here and seeing how the food in Birmingham compared with Seoul.

Firstly, none of the staff are Korean. Not that this in itself is a bad thing, but it would be nice to have some Korean staff in a Korean restaurant instead of all Chinese. All of the staff were friendly and efficient though, so we had no complaints with the service.

I found the food to be a disappointment though. While they had many of the normal Korean favorites, our food tasted very bland compared to authentic Korean. We ordered bulgogi, which didn't come with any of the normal side dishes, we even had to ask for lettuce.

If you had never been to a Korean restaurant before, then this place would be fine. But if you've already been exposed to proper Korean food, then you're probably going to end up disappointed.

176 From a Korean's perspective, I didn't find food at Miss Korea at all authentic or tasty. I could have made a better Bibimbap myself; Yuk-Kae-Jang tasted like mild beef stock; Kimchi-Jeon too sweet; Sam-Gyup-Sal tasted like cardboard.

I was surprised how Kimchi-Jeon and Hae-Mul-Pajeon were on desserts menu.... Just because the English translation is "Kimchi pancakes" and "Seafood pancakes" doesn't mean they are dessert material - far from it! The waiter who served me wasn't familiar with the menu, which made me having to point out the dishes one by one with my finger.

I was also appalled by how they refuse to serve tap water. Yes, bad for their profit - but shouldn't they still serve it if the customer wants it?

177 This is an interesting restaurant if you want to try something new..My Husband is gluten intolerant and the manageress doubled checked every dish was suitable before we ate..The customer service was excellent.There is a great selection of appetizers, we had King Prawns is spicy tempura batter, pork dumpling soup, with sweet and sour seaweed, all delicious..For mains we had spicy chicken and beef marinated in garlic, chilli and sesame oil. This we cooked on a BBQ plate in the middle of the table or we could have cooked in the kitchen.. Who knows any chef who would let you cook in their kitchen..!!! There are several dipping sauces that complimented the meat well..
We experienced and tasted new flavours..Great fun for all the family..
Cost for 3 people £55 including drinks.

179 With only one review for this restaurant (and a bad one at that), I didn't have high hopes. But, my wife really wanted to have some Korean food before a concert (Symphony Hall, a 10min drive away). So, this is the only Korean restaurant we could find in Birmingham.

It has a car park directly opposite. The restaurant is on the edge of China Town, and looks ok from the outside. On entry, its clean and tidy, nothing glamourous but pleasant. The menu is very Korean I think, although I think some of the staff were Chinese (not surprising in China Town). The menu had a heavy BBQ component, with the option to have BBQ bucket on your table to cook the food, or pre cooked by the chef. We opted for the later, as had limited time.

There were also the famous spicy cabbage dishes and soups. A good idea was to have option of jugs for juice/drinks, at reduced cost, which is good especially if your driving...plenty of juices to chose from too.

The food was fresh, plentiful, good value and really tasty. Lamb skewers went down a treat, as did the beef in beer and sliced pork dishes.

The only thing I could fault was no hand drier in the small gents toilet. Waitress was friendly, polite and attentive.

Would go again, its a really good addition to the cuisine availble in Birmingham China Town.

180 I wanted some water for my 2 year old son and was refused. After our meal I challenged the owner about refusing tap water and he said it was not healthy. Probably he meant not healthy for his profit margins. Disgusting attitude.

I am a huge fan of Korean food and have tasted many wonderful dishes in Korea itself. This is without doubt the worst I have ever had. The bulgogi tasted like a Chinese stir fry and the bibimbap was just run of the mill and quite tasteless.

To add to our misery, the owner had a tense and heated meeting with his staff a few tables away from us which made us feel uncomfortable. It just shows how unconsiderate he is. These meetings should take place behind closed doors and away from the public. I felt ever so sorry for the Korean cooks, they looked so sad and downbeaten by the owner’s bully approach.

Birmingham really needs a Korean restaurant. This is not it and you will be wise to avoid it. A huge disappointment.

184 If you're in Muscat and crave some authentic Korean food then head right over without a doubt in mind. The banchan served at the beginning of the meal is not of a huge selection but it is sufficient and tasty. The vegetarian Japchea is juicy and full of flavor. We ordered Kimchi jeon, it comes in a number of small pancakes which were hot and yummy. For the main meal we tried their ever famous half and half fried chicken and the stir fried spicy squid. My only disappointment was they had no Ice Tea and no free after meal dessert which in my experience comes with every Korean restaurant.

185 I just came back from my second trip to South Korea and have had Korean friends cook me yummy Korean food.
This place is legit.
Soups , Appetizers and main courses all are delicious.
You might find some small differences like beef in my soup was not thin strips but nonetheless very delicious with excellent flavor and plenty of herbs and mushrooms just like authentic soups I have had in Korea.
Rice was of good quality and cooked well.

We really enjoyed dining here. Our new favorite restaurant if visiting Muscat.

190 I like Korean food, that is why I decided to go to this restaurant despite so many Arabic, Indian and Turkish restaurants to try from. And I was happy with my decision. I had the ramen noodles - spicy and quite a big bowl, noodles were just right, fresh vegetables. Along came the mandatory Korean side dishes. All of them tasty, kimchi included.
Very nice and attentive waiter. Place is modern, neat and you have K-pop music to go with it, together with Korean music videos on the tv screen :)
I did not try other food, but left with a full stomach and satisfied. Give it a try, I am certain there is other good stuff as well!

191 I wasn't planning on Korean food during a short stay in Muscat but, it was right across the street from our hotel (Midan) and the good reviews here made it seem like a good bet. We were not disappointed! The service was very friendly and the atmosphere, while not fancy, was very clean and comfortable.

The marinated beef grilled at your table was tender and delicious (along with all the normal bitesize side dishes)! We had the mixed chicken and preferred the soy sauce to the sweet but, both were very good. The surprise best item was the ramen soup - a spicy (but not too) delight!

Would definitely go back!

193 Visited Taste of Korea for dinner this evening with my husband. It’s a little difficult to find but the food is worth the effort. It’s an easy 15 minute walk from The Chedi hotel. This was our first experience of Korean food but the menu was simple to follow & the waiter guided us with the amount of food to order. We went for one of the fried boneless chicken specials which was described as sweet & spicy. To accompany this we had the fried vegetable rice. We were also served a number of side dishes of various textures & tastes including miso soup. We really enjoyed our meal which was really tasty & really reasonably priced at 10 Rials. We would have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant to all.

195 After the wife suggested Korean for the first time ever and we googled it, this place came up with mixed but mainly good reviews even right here on Trip advisor. We though we'd give it a go. After driving around Gulf hotel apartments twice I had to get out of the car to walk around a little but eventually found it. Location could be better however that's all made up for when you try the food.

Small premises but comfortable, ambiance a little lacking as well and the food quality actually deserves a better more fitting authentic Korean mood in a nicer more accessible premises.

Anyway to the food, we ordered the Marinated Korean BBQ beef, the mixed spicy/sweet chicken, the Kimche rice and vegetable rice. The order came with an amazingly zestful tasty cold soup and a lot of sides and sauce . From the moment this stuff hit my tastebuds I was in heaven and I have now added Korea to one of those places one must visit before they die if only just for the food. Fragrant, aromatic, mouth watering, and satisfying. We will definitely be back don't care what the naysayers have to say. Friendly staff however a little on the pricey side (reduction of prices or family/group offers would greatly increase the traffic)

I highly recommend it and I'm

197 Noticed this place few months back and after a friend recommended it I decided to try it last week. Called them and got the map on whatsapp.

Ambience is minimal, we were the only diners on a weekday at 8:30PM.
Ordered a chicken salad which was nice and a kimchi fried rice which comes with a lot more side dishes like pickles, etc.
We also got a soup (Radish) with it.
We didnt like the fried rice as we found it bland. Might give the other apetizers a try next time.

200 i was pleasantly surprised to find a korean restaurant in the middle of muscat. the ambience and service were average, but the restaurant was clean. word of warning: it is kind of hard to find with all of the adjacent construction.

we ordered the set menu, which included pajeon (korean pancakes), japchae (sweet potato noodles), dukbokki (rice cakes in a spicy sauce), bulgogi (korean beef BBQ), and sides (bonchon). the food was average for korean food in korea or los angeles, but i suspect it is pretty good for muscat and oman.

the price was reasonable, but i am on the search for another korean place in muscat, which may offer better quality fare.

202 I am so glad i found it finally...after so long of searching for this korean resto. It is very authentic and brings you back to Seoul for their great dishes. It will not be called Amazing Chicken if you will not be amazed with the taste of their chicken dishes---the Yang Nyeom and Gan Jang or you can order it together! Superbly delicious!!! I cannot say more...you get to experience it and truly enjoy it. They offer you variety of complimentary appetizers and all the authentic korean dishes are there from the favorite japchae noodles to its bulgogi. Variety of soups such as kimchi, denjang and YukGaeJang will wake yourself up.

Highly Recommended for your dining experience.

Being a native Asian, I am very picky when it comes to Asian food and in this part of the globe, it's very difficult to find an authentic Asian food. Taste of Korea - Amazing Chicken is one of the few authentic Asian cuisine restaurant in Muscat. Food was presented with attention to detail and the taste was really tempting that I over ate again. Will definitely come back to try other listing service in the menu.

209 I found this restaurant on tripadvisor as I was looking for a Korean restaurant in Muscat. My friends and I ( a group of 5 people) had dinner here on the 21st of January, 2016. It's in an alley across from chocolate room. There is a little area to park your car in front of the restaurant. It's open 7 days a week. It's closed from 3 pm to 4.30pm. The prices are reasonable and the food is to die for. I had dukbokki, kimchi Jeon, japchae, my husband had bulgogi and my friend had bibimbab. They were all delicious. It is a small restaurant but if you miss Korean food in Oman you can definitely have it here.

211 We're fond of Japanese and Korean dishes, and ever since the first Korean restaurant that we discovered near Ghala closed, we missed eating authentic Korean food in Muscat. That's why when friends told us that there's another Korean restaurant in the capital, we searched for it and tried their signature dishes. We were not disappointed.
The chicken was fantastic (there are 2 variants, one glazed with honey-barbecue sauce, the other just plain fried). It is basically similar to the dish from our favorite restaurant when we visited Seoul. Their japchae was also superb, and the kimbap as well. Their bulgogi was not exactly what I expected, but it was also generally good.They even serve few Japanese dishes, such as the miso soup which we ordered, which, I would say, was also tasty. The only thing I was disappointed a bit was that the side dishes (ban chan) was fewer compared to the previous Korean restaurant that we used to visit.
This restaurant is a little bit small; there are only about 5 tables, if I remember correctly. There is ample parking space at the side of the building where the restaurant is located. In terms of location, the restaurant is not hard to find, as it is just on the opposite road of Chocolate Room, another popular establishment in Ghubra.
The price is a little bit on the expensive side, but that's how it is anyway in majority of restaurants in Muscat.

Decent Korean food, but we've had much better. If you visit, just nod your head and agree with the owner. :)

218 We visit Korea House when we want a change from our usual restaurants. The food is always good and they do have a limited selection of beer and wine. The food is Korean with some Japanese influences. The kimchi was not killer spicy, the dumplings were tasty, and the bulgogi (beef) was moist and tender. In the past I've had the very tasty but spicy kimchi soup. (Spicy items are clearly marked on the menu.) The decor in this small restaurant is the very home-like, with lots of Korean knickknacks on display. The service is polite and efficient, and the prices are reasonable for Boulder.

219 This place is a gem in Boulder, that few know about. This place has amazing food. I love their Mandoo soup. I always get that or their spicy beef soup. The kimchi is fantastic and the rice cooked to perfection. It is a family owned place (one of the few remaining in Boulder) where the husband serves the food and his wife cooks. He is the most pleasant person you will ever meet. He pulls out your chair for you when seating and always is attentive, and comes quickly if you need something. The restaurant is very cute and I admire the way he decorates. It is a random assortment of stuff from all over the world. The restaurant is always clean as if he just opened. The food smells delicious from the back. I have become a regular because of his food and the family’s kindness. I was having a rough day once and he brought a mochi dessert, on the house. If you are looking for quality Korean food at a reasonable price, this is the place to come. He is always so grateful to all who come to eat at his restaurant. This place, is by far my favorite place to eat in Boulder and I was born and raised here. He will go to any length to make sure you enjoy your meal. You can also do take out, but I highly recommend you stay and enjoy his hospitality. He has Korean and other Asian beers as well as sake of different types. This restaurant is sadly, tucked away behind a gas station so it is not visible from 28th street. But once you know where it is. It is very convenient with tons of parking available. Great place to eat alone, with family or friends. I always walk out with a smile on my face and a warmth in my belly due to his wife’s amazing cooking. To the customer who said that he charged them 20% tip without them knowing, then he did not read his receipt or the menu. So please disregard that review as, the owner is the farthest thing from a con man. As noted with the dessert he so generously gave to me. I have a feeling the customer leaving the one star review, had a party of six or more and it is common practice at restaurants, to place a 20% gratuity charge on this many at one table. So next time you want a really good place to eat with great service stop in here. It is well worth it. I guarantee you won’t be disappointed.

222 We visited on a Monday evening just to check it out. I tried the Bulgogi and it was good and tasted just like the Bulgogi I get in Korea. The Kimchi was also authentic, and they offer Kloud beer on tap so I had that. The service was excellent, provided by a kind and friendly Korean fellow. Prices were very reasonable.
There is a wide variety, a mix of Korean, Japanese and a bit of “pan Asian” on the menu – I suppose that Boulder is too small to support a Korean- only menu. As for beer, not so many Americans have heard of Kloud, Hite or Cass, so no wonder that more familiar brands like Asahi and Sapporo are also offered.
There’s a pleasant atmosphere with seating for around 30, so it’s not very large.
I would love to see a real down and dirty grill- at- the- table pork or beef Korean BBQ place in Boulder – I’ll bet it would be a big hit. But for the meantime, Korea House is worth going to, and returning to.

223 I lived in Seoul for almost a decade and this place's food tastes nothing like real Korean food. Overpriced (though I wouldn't eat their food again at any price, even free) and the "recipes" have been changed to "suit American tastes". Ha.

If you are in Colorado and want food that is more indicative of the cuisine you can find in Korea, I recommend Daegee (either CO location) or Soban in Aurora. Neither is spot on, but they are the closest I've found.

224 Contrary to previous reviews, the owner/server is friendly and efficient. He doesn't try to be your best friend, but that's not his job. He does see to it that your food arrives promptly, and that you have everything you need. I didn't need to wave him over for anything; all was foreseen. He checked several times during the meal, just in case.

I had the bento box with beef and dumplings, which proved quite tasty. It also included a cabbage side and rice. Unlike some Asian restaurants here, this one offers brown rice, a healthful plus.

The decor is a combination American country/Asian kitsch. The location is an easily-accessible strip mall with ample parking.

I will definitely return often, and I would encourage others to give it a try.

The owner told us that he can not sell us kim chi, since we have lunch special. Does this guy know how to run a business?
The food was average, but we were interrupted several times when he was trying to take our dishes while we were still working on them.
The only reason to come here is to have a meal in a quiet (read : deserted) environment.

So we ordered 2 lunch specials and 1 hot soup, but he says lunch special is very small, then I asked him how small, then he started to give us very bad attitude!

229 I had gyoza which was very good. My husband wanted Korean food, so he had a Bento box with beef and dumplings. His beef was supposed to be "thinly sliced" beef, but it was hamburger without seasonings. His dumplings were severely burnt nearly inedible. The salad was a bit of iceberg lettuce with no dressing. The white rice was harmless. When the manager (owner?) asked how our food was, we told him. He was rude and surly and followed us out the door and stood outside watching us as we drove away. I felt sorry for the little waitress, but no one should go there.

(Everyone thinks Japanese homes are like Zen Gardens,HA !) it was very cozy with many things everywhere, on the walls, on all the surfaces, on shelves, everywhere. So my thought was, ah new management, new cook. Alas, new does no mean better. This restaurant changes hands frequently, but seems never to rise above mediocre.
The owner-cook is very pleasant and capable, not sure how he'd handle a big rush with a complex order. But he was fine tonight.

234 First off, it seems some of the reviews below are highly inaccurate. You should ignore them entirely, especially the one calling into question the English skills of the owner (with particularly well-placed poor grammar).

This restaurant is the closest thing to being in Korea that I have experienced in Colorado. I lived in Suwon, South Korea for more than a year, and this place captures the ambiance exactly. It's like eating in a Korean living room, with fun little decorations everywhere.

The food is fresh, tasty, and authentically Korean. We didn't order sushi, but kept to the Kimchi Jjigae (김치 찌개) and Kimchi Jeon (pancake). It was relaxing, and we had a great conversation with the owner over our food. After he learned that we had lived in Korea, he gave us a Kloud beer on the house!

Very friendly. Very helpful. Very tasty. If you want Korean food in Boulder, this is the place to go!

235 My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful lunch here. We split the kimchi soup and deluxe combination. Our first taste of Korean food, and we were delighted with the new spices and tastes. To me the food was gourmet--high quality, lots of care. Seemed like very authentic food, dinnerware, decor, even music.
This is a small, family run restaurant. You feel like a guest in their home. Everything nice quality and gracious. Not inexpensive, but seemed worth it to us. Portions seemed just right--more would have been too much, and we never take home a doggie bag.
We look forward to eating here again.

238 The food was OK, not great. Seems like years ago there was another Korean restaurant here that was much better. I am not a big fan of a minimum credit card charge, especially a $10 minimum. So for one at lunchtime you need to spend $10 so the owner can save a few cents.
It is a shame because this restaurant could be so much better.

239 My husband and I both lived in Korea, and I have lived in Japan, and we found this restaurant to be just what we missed. We came for a late dinner, and had great food and service. This small restaurant stocks every kind of Korean and Japanese beer, has numerous appetizers and sides (dumplings, rice, kimchi, gyoza), many entree options, great sets, and a full sushi menu. The price is right and it's worth checking out.

240 Went here on my own when I was in the area for business. The décor is a bit eclectic and the restaurant is small. Because of this the service was prompt. My order came and the food was great. There was a small problem with my order, which the chef (and owner, I believe) was eager to rectify. After the fix he also brought me a free cup of Miso soup and some amazing honey ginger tea. I loved the kimchi and he was so appreciative of me telling him that. I felt like someone was cooking from their home kitchen and genuinely cared about my experience, and also took pride in their work. I'll go back any time I'm in the area!!

241 My husband went to pick up lunch and had a great experience. It was after normal lunch hours, so the owner took the time to walk him through the menu options (we were new to Korean food) and gave him a free cup of tea so he could thaw out a bit while the food was prepared. He ordered a bulgogi and a beef bibimbap. Both were delicious and the price was definitely right. We'll definitely try out more dishes in the future.

242 These people treat me really well. I love the KimChi Pancakes. I get them mild , delicious! If you are not accustomed to Korean Food or do not like a lot of spice , just tell them and they will tone it down for you as they do for me ! I love the Barbecue Chicken Salad. Do not miss the Pearl barley Tea. It is different, but it is great. The people here work very hard to satisfy you. Some of the items on the menu are an adventure for some Americans so ask if Americans are going to like them. If you are looking for Adventure the food is very good. The Soups are particularly good . Spicy and full of vegetables and sea food. You can them to adjust the level of spice if the stock is not pre prepared. The Korean style Sushi is a little different than the Japanese but if you like Sushi, you will like simple honest Sushi here.

243 The waiter of this restaurant was extremely ARROGANT and went totally psycho when two of us asked whether we could sit at a table of 4 when there is only one table taken by two guests in the entire restaurant with about 10 tables total. He owner said IT WAS THEIR LUNCH TIME and they did not want 2 guests to sit at a table of 4. I asked then why the other two guests were sitting at a table of four. he said because they were Americans. At that moment my friend and I just wanted to get food and leave but his rudeness was not done yet. When we ordered and asked about lunch special, the owner said NO, IT IS NOT LUNCH TIME! Then I asked:"When is your lunch time then?" He got pissed and asked us to leave. OMG! This is horrible.

I promised we were not being arrogant or anything. At the beginning I was thinking his rudeness might be a result of his limited English, as an immigration I should have more patience and sympathy. But no, i was wrong. He was rude and the reason he refused us what he served with the two white Americans was because we are not white.

Although I did not have the chance to dine here, I got a chance to glance at their menu. It was pricy compared to many other Korean restaurants in this area. And they don't have many typical Korean dishes on their menu. So it might be a good thing we were driven out of this place.

It was my first time ever to write a review about anything online. I just feel there are so many hard working restaurant owners and waiter/waitresses to be supported and this kind of people should run out of business if they are not changing their attitude.

Avoid this restaurant.

244 I have never felt such an overwhelming urge to write a negative review for an establishment.

I walked in after a long day of work looking to order some takeout and enjoy it at home. After perusing the menu I decided to order an appetizer (vegetable dumplings) and a roll of sushi. I'm a tiny gal (4'11 and 96 lbs.) so this is more than enough to feed just myself. I had, however, been looking forward to trying the food here and had every intention of coming back and eating in another day when I had more of an appetite and could order a larger meal. Today I wanted to keep it simple. The owner, however, refused to even serve me unless I ordered an entree, which I simply wasn't interested in today. Not only that, but if I asked any questions about the items or dishes, not only did I not get much of a response, he just seemed irritated and responded in a very condescending manner.

I left absolutely disgusted with the way I was treated, and you can rest assured I will NEVER step foot in this restaurant again. I'm positive there are plenty of other restaurants in the area that would be happy to have my business and who are actually interested in having returning customers.

Good luck establishing any kind of clientele with this attitude.

245 The food is average, and they were extremely rude to my family. The restaurant is always half-empty (at best) and they made a point to come tell us my two year old was being too loud. She wasn't doing anything other than talking and playing in a normal voice. They then proceded to rush us out and tell us we weren't welcome to return. I will never set foot in this place again. If you go, don't bring your kids.

246 I haven't had great Korean BBQ in Boulder or Denver in years. I had a craving for Kal-bi and decided recently to give Korea House a try based on some other reviews on here. Not only did I have a great and high quality meal obviously prepared with care for a fair price but I enjoyed the hospitality and friendliness of the staff and the owners.

When I walk into Korea House I feel like I'm walking into the warm inviting home of my one of my school friends when I was growing up. The food and the experience is prepared with love. Check it out!!

247 My husband and I came here for lunch. I had the hot stone bibimbap and he had the spicy pork bulgogi. My bibimbap came with soup which wasn't hot (I was cold so really would have liked some hot soup) and quite bland. The bibimbap was adequate, it is kind of hard to mess up bibimbap. The spicy pork wasn't at all like any bulgogi we have had anywhere. The flavor wasn't there and the sauce was pasty tasting. The meal came with two small dishes of kimchi and pickle none of the other accompanyments that I normally see. I have spent much time in South Korea and have visited many Korean restaurants and this just wasn't it. l always get worried when a menu tries to do too much. This place had everything from noodles to sushi.

248 This place is very authentic Korean. Bibim Bob is so incredibly good. Kim chi is tasty. Honey ginger tea is awesome. There is a dish with cellophane noodles, veggies and beef that is great. This place switched owners not too long ago, so some of these bad reviews are from before the new owners took over. I highly recommend checking this place out!

249 I have been eating at Korea house for years. It is small, unpretentious, and tucked away in a strip mall. They have redecorated recently, and I find the food is still great. I eat the Japanese food - this is, in my opinion, the best Udon Soup in town. Also great Gyoza. Couldn't tell you about the Korean food, but don't believe the bad reviews - it is a really great little place.

250 My husband and I have eaten at Korea House on occassson for several years and always enjoyed it but on our visit today, I was greatly disappointed. It looked like the decor had changed so perhaps it is under new management but they had better review their changes or I'm pretty sure the will go out of business. My favorite dish is Bulgogi ( a korean BBQ beef). This restaurant used to have wonderful slices of this marinated beef. The dinner I got today arrived in a "bento box" which is a novel way to serve Asian food, however, the meat that came in the box was like leftover scraps. It was about four tablespoons of beef shreds, the biggest was about the size of a dime. The was about half a cup of rice, a teaspoonful of green vegetable and about a tablespoon of Kimchi. I had ordered a combo with dumplings ( gyoza) and there were four of those without the unique dipping sauce that usually accompanies it. $2.00 worth of food costed $10.50. I left there very diappointed and hungry! Sad to say, I will not be back!

251 I had read preivous reviews which were very negative. So I was sckeptical. I went for lunch one day and since we enjoyed it, we went for dinner to see how they handled each service. Food was good. Service was very attentive. I travel a lot and always seek out asian restaurants. Korea House isn't 5 star but it is very good. The Kimchi is great. Pickled veggies are good.

The Kalbi (my favorite) is very good. The galbi was disappointing
Overall, I like this testaurant. Will defintely return.

252 We've had high expectations as we booked the Korea royal cuisine online costing us quite something even the package we chosen was the cheapest one.

The experience was contrary to what we expected. First, we were not sitted in a Palace like dining area. In fact it was like a shack with no window to any outside view and only big enough for 4 square tables inside. Next there's no air circulation comfort in the room, and it's next to the kitchen. So no ambience, no comfort and no view!

The food spread was good but was averagely prepared. There are couple of nice dishes such as the nicely cooked abalone but a lot other were very basics & ordinary. The cutlery used were also very ordinary making us feel the value for money is not worth it. Not to mention the beef was so tough that Myeongdong street bbq beef is so much better!

Conclusion, we feel the charges is simply not worthy the food & ambience provided, and we suspected this is far from the real Royal cuisine. Skip this!

253 my Korean Mum has reserved a representation here. Koreans seem to be very proud of their folklore. I found the representation nice but i was not impressed. Subtitles are in English available. You can take pictures with the dancers at the end and there is a very nice shop with high end artcrafts.

254 It was the history of the building and the so called traditional Joseon Dynasty meal described in the website that make me want to experience eating there. The reception where guests were received was bare, and I mean really bare. There was only a standing podium and a staff to receive the guests and check the name for the reservation. We were led to a dining room which looked like a dining hall. Not a tinge of class or history in there. Lunch was mediocre. We can get better food costing much less in restaurants in town. Description of the buildings within the compound seemed very interesting in the website but again I was disappointed. I mean they were architecturally nice traditional buildings but not as grand as I expected.
I was disappointed with the meal but may be it was lunch and the set meal that I gave have chosen is a let down. I give them the benefit of doubt that the Korean banquet and the meal with show may be better. The only thing traditional from this experience is that all the lady staff are dressed in their hanbok. Credit must be given to the staff who responded to online booking and enquiries promptly.

256 I booked dinner reservation after reading the history of this place, expected the dinner to be a true royal cuisine experience. Disappointed from the seating. Two types of kimchi was given to each, it tasted like cabbage with water! Is this what the kings ate? They sure missed out on something delicious! There were a few dishes that were OK, but overall they food lacked seasoning, and tasted like it was made in a hurry, like the sweet and dry bulgogi. There were only a few tables dining, those of us who were hoping the reviews of poor food would be wrong.

On the other hand, the show was very well done, even my niece and nephew enjoyed it, and they don't speak Korean.

Skip the meal, it is overrated and pricey for the quality.
Enjoy the show!

257 First of all, the place is nice, you can walk around the house for some picture taking of traditional house designs, though the area is not that big. Staffs are accommodating, friendly, and totally no issues for English communication. As I traveled with my pregnant wife, I do not have issues on asking them for those prohibited foods for her like raw meat and those with caffeine. Regarding the food, the food is great and a bit different compared to the typical menu on restaurant, thus not sure if those are actually traditional. What I remember is that the servings are small but it is a lot, and they serve it so fast that we haven't finished yet with the first one but they are already serving the 3rd dish. But i think they are doing it so you will able to finish your meal before the show starts. About the show, same with the other reviews, recommendable and very traditional. I'm about to give a perfect rating for this review because of the show, but I feel that the price is very expensive that I expect more, maybe on the food, and no extra charges on the drinks.

259 I don't really give reviews online, but I believe visitors should stay away from this restaurant, as my experience was totally disappointing.

My wife and I went to Seoul in October 2015 for our honeymoon. Although we haven't been to South Korea before, we do enjoy plenty of authentic Korean food in Sydney.

We picked this restaurant as we saw the good reviews on the internet. However, we were extremely disappointed after having the Royal Cuisine.

Before visiting the restaurant, I made a booking via email and to make sure we could have the "Royal Meal". Although I've got a response saying food did not need to be ordered in advance, I was told at the restaurant that "Royal Meal" need to be ordered in advance...

I admit that the service was good, and good service is common in Seoul, but the food was extremely bad. The meat was rough and the food was cold. We were expecting authentic traditional Korean food, but we ended up having some westernised/fusion dishes...

The meal was a disaster not only because of the low quality of the food, but also the environment. We were lead into a room where all foreigners dinning together, while I saw Koreans were allowed to dined in spacious traditional rooms.

For all the unpleasant hours I spent in this restaurant, I was charged $350 AUD for a 4-person meal. That is very unreasonable for the quality of food provided, as a good Korean Bulgogi (BBQ) dinner for 2-person would cost less than $100 AUD in Seoul...

That said, Seoul is a great modern city and I really enjoyed staying there. This was a bad experience, but other local restaurants I've been to were extremely good. I believe this place was setup to rip off tourists...

For visitors who's travelling to South Korea and looking for a Royal Cuisine, please look somewhere else and stay away from this restaurant!

260 First, I want to warn you that there are two restaurants called "Korea House" in Seoul. Take care which "Korea House" entry on Trip Advisor you are looking at. I am writing about the restaurant with this phone number 82.2-2266-9101 and the web address: http://www.koreahouse.or.kr/eng/?en_skin=index.html.

That other "Korea House" listed within Trip Advisor has several reviews that I believe are for the restaurant we visited. The other Korea House specializes in Korean beef dishes and the menu looked very interesting, but we did not eat there. The staff was gracious dealing with our mistake and called us a taxi.

Overall, the meal, service and environment were wonderful. We arrived an hour late, and in the dark, but were welcomed with smiles from our hostess wearing a traditional Korean costume. We were lead through a large patio area where dances and other programs are conducted during the day. On the far side we ascended a set of rough stone steps and followed a cobble stone path to the building we would dine in. It was very impressive and the landscape lighting made it even more so.
There are several separate buildings and if you sign up for a court cuisine dinner, you will be seated in your own dinning room. My daughter in law was concerned about my back and knees and asked that we be seated at a table rather than eating laying on the floor. When our hostess slid the door back of our dinning room the table was low, but the space under the table was hollow, allowing us to sit normally on padded seats that had backs. Very comfortable!

The dinner is very similar to ordering from a "tasting menu" at a nice restaurant.
There are several courses depending on the meal you choose. We had the Eojin Jeongchan dinner. It is pricey, but you are paying for the experience as well as the gourmet food. Follow the link I provided above, click on ENGLISH, and look at Royal Cuisine to see the menu. All of it was delicious and the experience was fun. Our waitress, dressed in the traditional costume, spoke good English and was very helpful, attentive, and did not seem perturbed in the least we arrived an hour late.

I don't know when I will have an opportunity to return to Seoul, but the full experience of this place was worth the stop. If you time it better than we did, you can also attend a theater production following the meal. See the website for details.

262 We truly enjoyed the meal, service and show. It was one of my favorite experiences in our 17 night trip to Korea. My wife is Korean and researched the menus and shows on the Korean website. Since I am a picky eater, we chose the Haerin Jeongsik menu. A little more expensive but very good. we accompanied the meal with a couple bottles of Bek Se Ju which became my go to drink for the rest of the trip.

A quote from their website: The traditional court cuisine of Korea House is cooked on the basis of the records contained in ancient literature. The foods are cooked by superior chefs at Korea House under the supervision of 'Han Bok-ryeo' who has been designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 38 for his expert knowledge about the court cuisine of the Joseon Dynasty).

Service freindly and outstanding. Maybe due to the constant delivery of new dishes throughout the meal and my wife's ability to communicate in Korean if they didn't understand my Texan. All the staff were dressed in traditional Hanboks.

We enjoyed the show and would see it again, given the opportunity. I particularly like the instruments and sounds they made. One selection was 4 drummers on stage playing together and putting on quite a show. I also like the dancers and the way their dresses shape while spinning around. All seemed very graceful in their movement.

After the show, the performers were in the lobby for people to take photos with them.

We took tons of photos but unfortunately they are still on the phones. Go to http://www.koreahouse.or.kr/eng/?en_skin=index.html for more info on food and show.

263 Hi All,
I would recommend this place very highly if your a foodie and want to explore authentic Korean cuisine. the standard menu chronologically designed to give you variety of food to your taste buds.
and the place is more than 60 year old and Korea house has a legacy of being dining place for Korean dynasty.
If you are in Seoul, South Korea. this is must visit place.

regards,
NT

264 The ambience of the place is fairly traditional and be prepared to sit on thin cushions with your legs crossed and tugged under low tables. The food served are in small portions and you can expect up to 10 varieties of traditional food served one after another by girls clad in hangboks. You may not know what you have been served and the best thing to do is to ask the waitresses on what and how best to eat it. As expected the meals can be very pricey. I personally do not fancy such traditional food served in this manner.

266 Korea House is known for it's great service and quiet settings. You pay a premium for the location. And the restaurant is only made up of private rooms so I recommend reservations, but usually they can squeeze a party of four.

The side dishes are usually exquisite here, the beef is of the best quality. Though for basically the same quality you can literally walk about 100 meters to Saebyuk-jib and eat good meat. But you are paying a premium here for the privacy and small touches. For example the charcoal that they use is not preheated and they light in front of you since they are using a very good quality of charcoal.

Ask the waitress for the best cuts of meat that are available at the moment and they will recommend for you. As each day quality can vary.

They also have a dried fish (bori-geul-bi) with a green tea soup with rice to finish the meal. You take your hot rice and drop it in your cold green tea bowl. Take a piece of the dried fish that is broken up for you and dip it in the sauce they give and immediately eat the rice that was mixed with the green tea soup. It is fabulous.

I enjoy the dish so much that I visit the restaurant for the dried fish during lunch time and skip the BBQ.

My coworker called for a pick up order and was told that they just opened and to call back 30 minutes later! We have people who did not like kimchi so we asked not to put it in their lunch which before was not a problem but now we were told to just take it out ourselves! Was very surprised how this place seems to have no idea about providing good customer service. Very disappointed as they do have good food.

278 Not sure if this is a chain similar to the one on colonial but the decor and menu items were similar, except this restaurant is bigger with a higher ceiling. Their sides were just as flavorful, was not overwhelmingly spicy. Still a fan of their hot stone Bibimbap. The waitress recommended the "Sundubu-Tzigae" tofu and seafood soup, count me in as a new fan of this soup. The black goat soup is no longer in season :(

Aside from soy sauce, they have a red sauce available which compliments any hot dish.

The staff was very friendly and the restaurant itself is clean.

They do have table top hibachi available if you want to cook the BBQ meat yourself.

I wish it was in a more flattering location, I think it borderlines a hole in wall concept, but do not judge the interior based on the outside, my mother was a little turned off but I insisted. We both left happy with our food choices.

We shared the steamed tofu appetizer - very generous serving and the sauce is just fantastic. We always ask for extra for the rest of the meal. My husband had the tofu bibimbap, I had sauteed octopus and veggies (nicely spiced) and our son loves the beef galbi. The side dishes are really good - I keep meaning to ask if I can get the green vegetable plus spicy radish as a main. The hot tea is very nice. They don't excel at dessert - but who has room?

The kimchee is just how I like it and the Mondu is amazing!! Flavors are great, staff is friendly, and I love feeling like I'm back at my ex-mother-in-laws eating. They offer non-spicy meals too if that is not your thing. They have the best of all the Korean dishes, including the soups and the Korean BBQ. Whatever you're in the mood for, they got it, when it comes to Korean cuisine.

We began with a vegetable pancake that was very good especially with the hot sauce that came with it. My chicken was spicy and perfectly cooked.

I am very pleased I went and will go back the next time I am in Sanford. The experience is well worth it.

291 I've been here twice for lunch and ordered the bibimap both times which is a dish of rice, egg and vegetables and I believe meat if I'm not mistaken. It comes out sizzling sort of like fajitas and continues to cook in the clay pot which is a neat experience. It's also served with six different kinds of kimchi - which if you're not familiar with is a wonderful probiotic (gut health promoting) food and they were all fantastic. If you're familiar with latin food, you know that people get to fighting for the crispy rice in the bottom of the pot which is another highlight for me about the bibimap in the clay pot. My husband ordered the korean barbecue lunch and he really enjoyed it. The menu is full of dishes that seem similar to Chinese and Japanese stir fries as well as other seemingly uniquely Korean dishes. They also have tables where you can cook yourself in the center of the table.

The young man who took care of us was wonderful, and since they weren't busy during that visit he took a few moments to answer some questions and correct my pronunciation.
I had watched videos and read up on the variety of cultural dishes. The meal we were presented with was beyond what I could have hoped for. Everything tasted SO DAMN GOOD! When I was visiting South Korea and ordered the same things, I wasn't surprised that the quality & execution of the meals I received here were the same as in Seoul, etc.
Since my trip my husband and I go out to Korea House at least once every 6 months. Every visit is just as good as the last and the staff are always so polite. Sometimes they'll even make special training chopsticks for my boys.

296 Pricey. But good Korean food. Everytime we are around Longwood area- we crave for the food here. Bulgogi, Gimbab, and so on.

297 Three adults introduced two kids, all of us non-Korean, to this cuisine...and it was a great experience! The service was superb, explaining any dish we weren't familiar with, and preparing the meat for us at the grill built into our table (which the kids loved). Apart from one appetizer that wasn't a big hit, all of the grilled meats and side dishes were excellent -- especially the Pork Bulgoi, which was labeled as spicy but was more of a pleasant tingle than really hot. Try this place if you like a Kobe-type Japanese restaurant -- much more flavorful cuisine here, and lower prices.

298 When you visit either get one of the bowls or go all out and do it right by sitting at the bbq table and cook your Korean bbq yourself. What a fun place! If you go for bbq be ready for the copious sides they bring out in little dishes. They provide refills on the little sides if you ask; don't worry it's plenty of food. The kimchi here Be ready because this place is the real deal! Mmmmm!

There is an attached karaoke bar you rent a room and you get food and alcohol delivered to your private room! Great party place this is a real experience most authentic in Orlando area.

299 Over the years their menu has changed and as well as the décor. Their menu appeared to have more selection. The staff was pleasant and welcoming. They will ask you if you want a table with the stove grill or a standard table. We got the standard. I ordered a Gimbap for an appetizer. It is their take on a sushi roll. It was quite good. My wife had the Dolsot Bibimbap which is a veggie mix with Kimchi in a hot bowl. It also had an egg in it. I had the Sundubu Tziigae that is a hot pot with seafood and tofu. The taste was great but only 1 shrimp, 1 piece of squid and a tiny piece of probably octopus. They did refill the little dishes of kimchi items; service was very good. Overall I felt the quality and portions dropped. Korean dishes have been a favorite of ours for some time.

300 If you like Galbi or Pork Bulgogi, this is the place. Great kimchi. Service was excellent tonight. Food came out hot. Everything was superb. You know it's good when it's packed with Koreans. I've been going here for 20 years. My favorite restaurant. Glad it's close by. If you like Korean food , this is the ONLY place to go.

301 Went for dinner. This WAS our go-to Korean restaurant. We sat down and immediately noticed very LOUD rap music coming through the restaurant speakers. Young servers and several young people standing around kitchen doors. We asked if they would turn off the music, and they asked if we wanted to move to another table. So we moved to a table at another Korean restaurant. The owners shouldn't let the children run the restaurant!

302 I was beyond surprised and relieved to find good Korean food in this state. I'm from NYC so my standards for Asian cuisine in general are obnoxious. We had galbi (well seasoned & delicious), ddukbokki (super spicy & wonderful), (average) chicken fried rice and some (average) pork belly. Everything was fresh, authentic & inexpensive. I would come back here if I ever find myself in Longwood again. The staff here is also quite nice.

303 Besides all the great awards, this place has a special award in our hearts. The food cannot taste authentic enough until it is served with the proper ambiance. You'll be delighted by the grills built in the table sections for family style or large party. For a smaller party without grills, It also has quaint private tables. The wait staff are always very cheerful and will explain in broken english what you want to order. Lovely people will serve the side dishes that are always fresh and always an incredible variety. A variety of Korean wines are offered that are served in a special sake cup. Reasonable prices and a great menu await you. I encourage you to take the right person with you who will appreciate this culture and not spoil your time with limits.

Today at Korea House i finally had food as good. We had Bulgogi and Bibimbop, all delicious as was their accompanying Ban Chan or small side dishes. The staff was helpful, friendly and pleasant. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant it is worth the drive from Orlando.

311 I asked one of my students, who was Korean, where I should try Korean out. He replied "Korea House" in Longwood. I was so happy, since it is near my house! I have been several times now and I am extremely happy!!! The staff is friendly, the food is good, and the addition of a Karaoke club is even better!!! I have not had a bad meal here! The price is a bit steep, but I'm sure you can do better on price if you don't want to try everything, like I do!!!

314 My wife would like to try some Korean food and we found this one near us. We ordered the seafood hotpot recommended by someone else, and we actually felt a little bit disappointment. The quantity was enough for two persons, but most of them are vegetables and tofu. A few seafood inside, such as shrimp.

We still believe it is the best Korean cuisine in Orlando area. Maybe we have not tried its best Korean food yet, and we would like to take another chance later on.

315 My wife and I really enjoyed our dinner here. They also have Hibachi-style, table-side cooking, but we ate at a table. The ribs were so good, but I got full very quickly from a big lunch earlier. They made my hotel room smell so delightful every time the fridge door opened and I almost cried when I left the leftovers in the fridge due to a long day ahead on the road.
For someone who enjoys Korean BBQ short ribs and live/travel to Orlando or Central Florida, this is the place to go. The beef bulgogi was amazing, too. Portions were large and the appetizer of dumplings was very tasty, too. We love Korean food, though we admit we typically do not eat everything. This place is the place for someone who wants to try Korean or eats it often, in my opinion. We will be back. I will also bring a cooler and get an extra order of short ribs.

318 I'd been to Korea House a number of times in the 11 years I lived in the Orlando area. As with any Korean restaurant, they stick to real Korean food. There is no Americanization for any reason. If you don't like spicy food (and I don't mean spicy like Mexican food--that's mild, actually), you're probably better to go somewhere else, but there are a couple of options safe for non-Koreans.

I travelled to the Orlando area a few days ago for the first time in four years. I got together with 3 friends and we visited Korea House. They've resolved a lot of situations since moving to the newer location north of Rangeline Road. The service was quite good. They've installed vents over a few tables to allow for Korean BBQ. Korean BBQ is where you choose ingredients and cook it at your own table.

The friends chose Gal Bi, Bul Gogi, and Pork Bul Gogi. I chose Dae Gu Jji Gae. They really, really liked the food, and being Caucasians, they don't have much experience with real Asian food. That's not a criticism--it's a fact, when places like P.F. Chang's represents itself as real Chinese food, what can you think?

I was thrilled with my Dae Gu Jji Gae, but I really dislike the fish bones. I know what's going to happen. They don't remove the meat of the fish and put it in the pot to cook. They put the fish in the pot in pieces, including the bones. Cod is typically bony anyway, so it was a good-bad choice. I scooped a bit of the broth into another bowl and let the three of them try it. They were especially surprised when I told them that it was medium spicy for real Asian food.

We had a good visit and a good meal. Korea House's owners--a family of four--care a lot about food and people. They really want you to have food you'll always love. It shows!

319 The food here was really delicious. I came with a friend who was vegan, and there were a couple of options on the menu for him but most were meat.

320 The place is very warm and welcoming, and also the staff tried their best to make us feel at home. They answered our questions regarding the food perfectly to help us decide, and the food ended up being quite affordable and very tasty! We had some Feuerfleisch, which apparently it's the national dish in South Korea, and some pork and squid, all of them incredible!

Pro tip: don't miss out on the sake, it was cheap and exceptional!

322 The place is so small and they only accepted people with reservation in advance for dinner. This is our second time in this restaurant and we have noticed they getting busy or more hectic. Many people come and refused as they not making reservation even only 1-2 person. The food was the same, the Fish soup with red chili broth was great and tasty. The kimchi soup with Tuna also very delicious but the Bibimbap a little-bit boring, too dry and no have a good taste of sesame paste as in Seoul or any city in Korea. The free appetizers is always generous portions like in many Korean style restaurant. The high light was the Cinnamon drink, a little bit too sweet for western tongue but compliment the spiciness of Korean chili paste on the dish. The staff is friendly and seem so busy as she is alone serving so many guests.

323 This is a very small local restaurant situated in Wedding, Berlin. Interior is very relaxed, and brings auticity to the restaurant. The food is really great, kindda home cooking style, and isn't that just preferable, frankly. Very tasteful and good.

Be sure to book a table beforehand, as the place is always packed. Very recommendable.

326 This little restaurant is run by a family that lives in the same building as the restaurant. It is worth ordering one of the meals that is cooked at the table and shared among all. We went with 6 people and got a meal that was grilled at our table for us and served with numerous side dishes. We definitely did not go away hungry. The waitress explained every step she was doing, telling us how long it would be until she was back to stir, etc., so we knew it was not time to start eating the dish yet. When it was ready, she demonstrated how to wrap it in lettuce for eating, and handed her demo to me, the oldest woman in the group.

327 The worst experience I have ever had in a Korean restaurant!

I am an Asian myself and have been in South Korea. I can say that I have had amazing Korean food everywhere in the world, but for sure NOT in this Korea Haus!

I went there with my friends and wanted to try out this Korea Haus, since our favorite Korean restaurant just moved to Charlottenburg. The food was disappointing and the price was way too high according to the size and the taste of the food. The four of us ordered four dishes, including two portions of Bulgogi, one fish soup and one noodle dish. The bulgogi cost 15€ per person, and the two portions we had were not even enough for one person to get full. There was barely anything in the fish soup, maybe four tiny pieces of fish?! The noodles were kinda OK, but did not have much flavor.

Two small side dishes came with the food. Since the four of us shared the side dish, we asked for another portion of kimchi. The waiter was nice enough to tell us that we have to pay for extra kimchi. We were surprised to hear that because ALL the normal Korean restaurants offer side dishes for free, as a custom. The waiter went to ask the owner if we could get one for free. The owner came out from the back with such an arrogant attitude and told us we cannot get one for free. He said, if we want to have free side dishes, we should go to another place. We were totally shocked and could not believe it. The owner obviously only wants money and does not care if any customers come back again or not.

Furthermore, I, for the first time, had diarrhea after having Korean food.

As a foodie, I will never go back to this place again and would also advise all Korean food lovers to avoid this place. You deserve better food and treatment for your money!

328 i would have never thought that this place could reserve such a surprise!
we had the buffet (6€). we didn't eat meat but the rest was more than enough! there is a selection of korean pickles (kimchi, cucumber pickles, carrots, beets, delicious stuffed peppers and others) you can tell that they are homemade. kimtchi was not particulary strong flavoured, as i like it, but my companion preferred it like this.
the lady prepared for us freshly deep fried vegetables puffs, banana and fish fillets. I was really surprised, the fish was actually really tasty and fresh, perfectly well cooked, juicy and delicious! even the rest rest was not greasy at all.

there were a few other dishes that I haven't tried, from what i could see it was noodles in different sauces with veggies and meat. there was a hot and sour meat soup as well, and rice of course!

I was so happy of changing my mind about this little family-run restaurant. the owners really care about what they are doing, and even though they don't have many clients, whenever someone arrives they treat him like a real host at their place.

the furnishings is really heavy and peculiar, but in its own way it gives a feeling of authenticity (though not Korean! elvis was printed all over on the seats :) ). the owners seem to be there out of any pretention, if not to do the best they can to prepare good food.

i left this little place with a smile and bitterness too,for having prejudged koreas Haus as just another fake orientalish imbiss for so long before TRYING IT!

well at least it has been a good lesson for me! and maybe for you as well!

331 I had one of the most stressful airport experiences I’ve ever dealt with, left the airport to find some drinks/food and stumbled across The Cinder Bar. The owner and his amazing bartender from Vietnam completely turned around my entire day. 5 minutes in I had a huge smile in my face from the friendliness of the staff. I had some drinks which were all great prices and a burger which was delicious. Perfect for if you have a layover that’s long enough to leave the airport but not long enough to go too far. Incredible place!

332 This bar is newly opened and is an offshoot of another bar of the same name in Incheon City.
Very much nicer than all of the sterile airport hotel bars around this area. A lively welcome from Warren Kidd, the owner, who asks your name and introduces you to everyone in the bar. Makes for easy conversation and a friendly atmosphere.
The bar staff keep the party and conversation going by joining in - with a focus on encouraging the buying of rounds of drinks ("ring the bell and buy everyone in the bar a drink"!). Great for the profits, but also great for the atmosphere created. Genuinely enjoyable and a fun atmosphere.
I didn't have any of the food, but it looked like decent bar food (burgers etc).
A highly entertaining evening, marred slightly by the feeling that everyone was being pushed into drinking more. One of the best bars that I have visited.

340 In a land of cookie cutter bars and franchises, this quaint bar stands out and demonstrates how to "do it right". Take all of the items from a normal bar, add a superior sampling of alcohol choices and a friendly staff who bring customer service to the next level. Mix these things together and you get a bar that performs, where the seats are always warm because nobody wants to leave. Awesome place. I'm glad it is in Songdo because if it were anywhere else, this place would have a line spilling out into the street and you'd never get a seat. The music is top notch as well.

In addition to expertly-prepared cocktails, and wine and beer, they have a great bistro menu of largely western bar food. The host, Warren, was exceptionally friendly and gracious and is a consummate host. The clientele is very diverse and all seemed to be having a great time.

360 Before leaving NZ to live in Songdo, South Korea, I checked out the important things to me squash, golf and a good bar. Squash is virtually non existent, golf is too expensive, but the Cinder Bar , oh the Cinder Bar. From the first moment I entered the doors of this small bar, I realised it had a huge heart. The guy who runs it tirelessly is Warren, a guy who remembers everyone’s names. The beer selection is amazing ... 12 on tap and at least 12 different bottled ales. The food is simple , but wholesome and tasty. Do not visit Songdo, without checking the Cinder Bar out.

379 Absolutely great place for a good pint and a really good burger, especially for western flight crews overnighting in ICN.

The best part is that if you're the lucky one who enters the place and happens to be airline employee #100, your bill is free. You just won't know it until it's time to pay the bill.

380 I had a great experience at The Cinder Bar. The drinks were great and the service was even better. I highly recommend visiting if you are in the area!

381 Since moving to Korea in January 2017, this is by far the best spot in the area!! There is a great mix of local, expats and travelers passing through Incheon/Songdo leading to a "never know who you might run into" evening.

The location is a bit hidden for a first-timer, but that adds to the mystique. Once there, the interior is intimate and welcoming. There's also additional seating upstairs and a recently added dart machine for a fun competitive game with friends. And for spring and fall, there is outdoor seating as well (you will appreciate the air conditioning indoors during the Korean summer months!). Don't miss out on the monthly Trivia Night as well for a good time with co-workers or friends.

The food, with the recently expanded menu, is always great. Remember, the Cinder Bar is a bar, so the menu is very appropriate, but don't let that fool you in terms of quality and taste! My personal favorites are the colonel chicken sandwich and wings...which remind of wings from back in the US. The burger, fish sandwich, fish & chips and fries are also favorites and give a variety of choices. Cost is very reasonable and appropriate.

On to the beer....the Cinder Bar offers a dozen or so beers on tap and countless bottled beers. The tap selection is vast from Asia-Pac to Europe to US to local craft and includes many types (pilsner, stout, IPA, porter, wheat, etc.). The whiskey selection is also extensive with many of my favorite single malt Scotches!

And lastly, the services is always phenomenal, which is the main reason I return. Warren, the owner, and his staff are always welcoming to both regulars and first time visitors. He goes out of his way to introduce himself and get to know his patrons.

So if you've relocated to Songdo or happen to be passing through, I recommend an evening at the Cinder Bar.

382 Cinder Bar is the best place in Songdo to chill out, meet new people, and enjoy some quality international beers. Oh wait, did I mention they also make the best burger in town?!

Cinder is run by absolute legend Warren, along with his mate Sam. These guys are hard-working, honest Kiwi blokes who always put their customers first. Warren even arranged free tickets to the baseball for me!

I’ve spent the past 6 months living in Songdo and visiting this bar on a semi-frequent basis. When I moved here I didn’t know anybody. Now I’m leaving Korea and most of the people I know have all been Cinder Bar contacts through Warren.

They show the baseball, rugby and many other sports, not to mention live bands and quiz nights. This place has all the hallmarks of a western style bar, but with a genuine Korean welcome.

Highly recommend you pay a visit any day of the week - oh and say hi to Warren and Sam for me!

Keep up the good work lads!

383 I have travelled all over the world, been to countless bars, pubs, and restaurants..

The best way to describe the Cinder Bar is it's all of the above wrapped into a perfect little package of great times, exceptional drinks and tasty food, all in a warm, extremely welcoming atmosphere!!

Warren, and the entire staff at the Cinder are excellent people and extremely personable. They will go above and beyond to ensure that if you arrive a stranger, you'll certainly leave as a friend. This is clearly evident by patrons who return time after time again.

These people, this place is clearly special, and truly one in a million!!

Hope to see you at the Cinder Bar soon!
- Cheers!!

384 I had a little trouble finding the place but once I did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet. Amazing! The beer was ice cold and served in good portions. Beer price was a little steep for me but I hit happy hour just right so I got a bit of a break. Totally satisfied. Pro tip if you are trying to find it: if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it's on the left side of the street before the bridge. It's in a bit of an alcove in a housing development. Set back off the road a tad. There's a sign the points left and I made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road. Unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it. Obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it's the first set of building after the bridge on the right. The staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice. The fish and chips are phenomenal. Did I mention the fish and chips are great. You should definitely try the fish and chips.

387 I was on business in Korea, and my work colleagues took me out for a beer after work. Arrived at The Cinder Bar, which was my friend's regular. Primarily because it is one of the few true Expat Pubs in all of Incheon. The Kiwi, Warren, runs the Pub, and he was most hospitable. We settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely. Even had time for some fish and chips: the fish was covered in golden batter, and the chips were delicious. The bar looks a little broken down (as was the area it was located in), but that added to the charm. If it was a rugby night, you could watch the TV, but it would've been a bit of a squeeze. There was also an upstairs, loft-style area.
Overall, a pleasant evening after work.

390 I stopped in at the suggestion of coworkers. I wasn't disappointed. Warren (the owner) gave me a warm greeting and took very good care of me. The bar was a mix of local and expat patrons. Great selection of beer and although I didn't eat here, from what I saw the food looked very good (western style) and people seemed to enjoy it.

I'll definitely go back the next time I'm in Incheon.

The drink prices are very good and the food prices are great too! Warren, the owner, speaks English and Korean so he talks to everybody. He is so popular that he could be the future mayor of Incheon.

The music here is always good and the service is always excellent. You have to come here.

396 What a find the Cinder Bar is! Amid the high rise buildings stuffed with expensive restaurants, massage places, doctor's offices and just about everything else in this city there is a much better option. The Cinder Bar is located on the ground level at the last building on the left side of the road just before the bridge as you leave Incheon for the airport. Warren and his new partner Sam have crafted this cozy establishment into a welcoming, warm and friendly place to have a nice meal and a brew or two. If you are in the mood, they also have a superior selection of single malt whiskeys. The prices are the best you will find in Incheon and the atmosphere is unmatched. The food is excellent as well. This is a family affair and Warren's wife is the establishment's cook. Of particular note is the new hamburger offered which is a new collaboration between Warren and "The Flying Chef". It's easily the best burger in town. Should you decide to give the Cinder Bar a try I can guarantee you will have a new favorite hangout on your list.

399 I was at a conference in Korea earlier this month and I was invited to this bar because one of the guys playing in the band was also at our conference. With other people from the conference, we went there and I had a great time. The music was great, the drinks were great and the vibe there was very chill and positive. Warren, who I think is the owner, was talking to us and making conversations with us and made us feel like we had been there before. If I ever go back to Korea, I'd definitely go there again.

400 Cinder bar is a great bar to visit when in Songdo. It can be found near the center of the city by the bridge. There is a good selection of beers and other drinks and Warren is always thinking about bringing in new ones.

The owner, Warren, is very friendly and open. There are often quiz nights, music and other events going on.

A great place to meet people as well.

It's worth a visit.

402 I have been coming to this bar since late 2015 and I must say that I am continually impressed by the motivation and innovation of the staff here. From a continually expanding drink menu, which will have you staring at the pages for hours, to the jazz nights and their trivia night, Cinder bar and its crew make every visit unique. As a long time customer it is hard to be unbiased but the only advice I can offer is that whether you want to just go out and meet some new people, prop up on a bar stool and down beers or sit at table and have some cocktails.. Cinder is the only way to go.

403 The night I chose to check out this place happened to be Warren's (the owner's) birthday, the entire bar was more than happy to help him celebrate. The people are extremely friendly, when I first arrived I assumed that everyone in the bar were old friends. I was traveling alone and it didn't take very long before a group invited me to hang out with them at their table. Turns out most people had just met that night everyone was just mingling. I definitely recommend stopping in at Cinder Bar.

410 Okay, so here we are in Incheon and we want a cold beverage and something to eat. We've been here quite a few times and haven't been too lucky. We check out Trip Advisor and guess who's #1, Cinder Bar! We're reading the reviews and Warren, the owner's name keeps popping up. We head out to find The Cinder Bar.
We walk in and are instantly greeted by, guess who? Warren! He is one passionate and friendly man. He wants us to enjoy ourselves. The music was so great. We were hungry and he recommended a few items and they were delicious.
Warren is known for his famous gin and tonic, I'm not a fan of gin. He insisted we try just one, which we shared. I slurped it down and now I like gin and tonics.
We ordered his homemade dip and chips, chicken wings and fish and chips. All very, very good.
Warren, we're spreading the word, we had so much fun!

419 Cinder Bar is one of the most hospitable bar/foreign bar I know in Incheon. It is located in the out skirt of Dream City, Incheon, near the bridge. Warren, the owner is kind, generous, respectful, and so are the rest of his crew. This is the first and only review I have written on my own for any travel site, and I will say this bar is a great place to make new and promising friends. You will get to meet some great people, many of whom are regulars there like myself... not saying I drink to often, but that I enjoyed hanging out with people from the bar. Not only is this bar a great meet up for old friends or new friends, but even other bar owners or restaurant come here to have a great time.

420 After being recommended to go here by foreigners and Koreans alike I made the trip here (it's about an hour from where I live). Easy enough to find...keep the starbucks on your left and walk straight and pick up the sign!
I was instantly made welcome by Brandon the doorman who showed me in and sat me down at the bar. The owner Warren asked me what I was after drinkwise n made some excellent recommendations...all were consumed and were expertly made!
Warren has made an excellent atmosphere and the customers were all in on it. I arrived alone but left with the intention of going back and continuing to meet great people.

I can't recommend here enough...alone or in a group you will have a fun time. And check out the g n t's! From an English man, they hit the spot and more.

Thanks to all they guys at the cinder for a great time n I'll be seeing you again!

421 The Cinder Bar features some of the best mixed drinks I've ever tasted. Ask for the Gin and Tonic, or signature Long Island Ice Tea made with all top-shelf ingredients! The best part of this bar though is that Warren and his staff take time to get to know you. When you come back, they remember your name and you can practically pick up your last conversation where you left off, even if its been awhile. You feel like you're among friends from the moment you step through the door. Don't miss out on this great spot in Songdo!

We took a taxi there and the taxi driver spoke to the owner for directions. I never expected the Irish Owner to speak perfect Korean, but apparently he does. And then, get this, he waited outside for our taxi to arrive. Could he be nicer? NO. Could he have made a more inviting place for visitors to grab a drink and have a chat? No. Warren, you are a rock star and your bar is deserving of every 5 star review it gets. Like we told you that night -- we want to franchise you!

443 Irrespective of whether you are a local, an expat living in Korea or just passing through the area, you really should be visiting The Cinder Bar. Put simply, you won't find a warmer welcome, a nicer atmosphere or a more enjoyable environment to spend an evening in.
The thing that really stands out about the place is that the team there are clearly genuinely interested in you having a good time whilst you are there and go out of their way to show warmth and friendliness, irrespective of if you are a regular or a visitor from out of town.
Food is tasty, drinks are excellent, cocktails are made with care and attention to detail. Prices are extremely reasonable, too.
The really nice thing about the place is that the positivity is infectious! Not only are the staff incredibly friendly and helpful, but this rubs off on the clientele, too. It really does feel like a little community!
If you are looking to spend an enjoyable time in the area, this is the first place to visit.

446 After trying to find a bar that suited our needs, we were directed to Cinder bar. We were welcomed by friendly staff and the host with the most Warren Kidd from NZ. Who welcomed us with a smile and stories to go with. We managed to watch the NRL grand final with all having a great time and bringing more friends. The chicken wings to die for and the mini sliders that helps the famished traveller. Beers on tap are, Stella Artois and max but never leave the place without trying the famous cinders flaming shot with Warren(host) explaining the process. Most westerners drink here. Bar staff are well mannered, trained and speak English. This cozy, warm, fun and cool place with a selection of music that will tickle your ears and suitable for all ages and its home away from home. Cinder bar can order your cab for you and Warren is happy to escort you and being fluent in Korean able to show off his skills with local knowledge conversing with the driver able to direct the driver to your final destination. I have attached two photos with address and direction from the business card. Smoking & Drinking is permitted outside but be aware of noise as neighbours are living near by. I have had many happy memories there and have met people from around the world there. It's not a nite club but more like a pub. Somewhere to relax, unwind, have a chat, catch up, and have a beer. I have given a 5 star rating for excellence in every aspect of service from the moment you walk in. It's so hard to leave. To Warren and Staff, thank you for everything on behalf of Rocket, Thor aka Thoro aka Tom. Signing off,

Jake

449 In Korea for Presidents Cup and went to The Cinder Bar after dinner. Great bar with a really fun atmosphere. The owner and bartender, Warren, goes out of his way to make sure every customer has fun and the gin & tonics are out of this world. If you are in this area and want a relaxing drink, go see Warren at the Cinder Bar.

450 Great little spot. Kind of hidden, basically the first place on the new city side of the bridge. Good food, good drinks. But like everything in Korea, it is small compared to American standards, no worries if the weather is nice, you can spill out onto the street.

453 The owner is incredibly sweet and caring. You can see it in how he talks to his guests and how he cares deeply about his business and the community of Songdo. I was studying abroad in Songdo for about a year, and I can easily say that going to The Cinder Bar made me feel right at home and also very welcomed in a country/place that I was new to. Warren is not only kind, but also innovative. The food is delicious. I can't get enough of the fry dip! And he always had a new drink recommendation for me and my friends that we always loved! He is always reaching higher and making The Cinder Bar a fun, exciting, and comfortable place to meet up with friends and enjoy the night. Highly Recommend! Definitely swing by!

454 Hannah and Warren are doing a great job building upon what Luke and his team started. There's always a warm welcome and good mixed company. The interesting range of drinks available traverse the globe too, from serving Korea's Maxx, new Zealand beers and decent Scotch whiskey to Manhattans and Warrens' signature cocktails... and now you can enjoy tasty food there too. Would I recommend a visit? Definitely, from meeting people in the community and watching a rugby match to having a quiet drink, this bar has it all... and the playlist pleases too! Probably why it's been our local for over a year.

456 I first came here back in May, and now I am one of the regulars. I love it! Some of my new best friends I met at the Cinder Bar!

The owners, Warren and Hanna, are always lovely and are introducing new Cinderites to us all the time.

The drink selection is fantastic. I personally enjoy the Monteith's selection from New Zealand; especially the Radler!!
Food-wise, the wings are my favorite, but it's the Cinder sauce that make them absolutely divine!!

The Cinder Bar is the new mover and shaker in the city of Songdo.
Check it out.... NOW!

457 The beer is reasonably priced including a few New Zeeland made beers you can't get anywhere else in Songdo. If you are feeling hungry they offer a couple options including some killer wings that come with a their own unique 'Cinder Sauce'. The real highlight of Cinder Bar is the service, the owner Warren is there every night and he is by far the best bartender in Incheon, he is warm friendly, and never let's an empty glass sit. Despite being born in New Zeeland he has lived in Korea long enough to speak fluent Korean. Because of this the atmosphere is unique it's not just a 'foreigner bar', every member of the Cinder crew can speak English and Korean so both locals and foreigner mingle in roughly equal proportions.

460 After being in Korea for about 2 weeks on business I was getting a little tired of endless Korean food. Had a night by myself and found this place down the sheet from my hotel. The owner greeted me at the door and found me a seat at the bar. Had a great conversation with the bar tender, owner and a few of the other patrons. The food was excellent and the beer selection very different than the surrounding bars. Highly suggest asking the owner for his recommendations.

461 Initially, we had some trouble finding the place. It's tucked around in back of the building, not in the front. We called and Warren's wife came around the block to meet us and lead the way! How's that for service???

Warren came over and welcomed us immediately upon arrival, making us feel right at home. He asked us about our normal drink preferences, then made some suggestions and headed off to get them.

We tried several different beers and of course, had some pub grub. The burgers and shrimp scampi are great!! Good portions and lots of options to wash it all down.

We met serval of the locals/regulars, who are all super friendly and fun to hang with.

All in all, a great time with great food!! Also, wonderful owners who truly enjoy taking care of their customers and doing everything they can to make your experience a great one!!

473 I can't really say enough about this establishment. The atmosphere and the staff's enthusiasm makes this a "must see" while in Songdo. The food is great, the beer selection is spot on, and the conversation is second to none. I frequent this pub every time I travel to Korea. So, get off your duff and mosey on down to the Cinder Bar. Oh, and ask for the killer Cinder (gin) and Tonic.

476 Had an overnight layover in Incheon and was looking for a spot to get out of the airport as we had a room at the transit hotel. After getting a stamp on our boarding card from the airline (needed!), we were allowed to leave the airport. Warren, the owner, gave our Uber driver directions on how to get to the bar (20 min from the airport). Kitchen open late for fish/chips and wings. Great alcohol selection (IPA imported from the U.S. on tap!) Great spot and will come back next time we have an overnight layover on Delta or Korean Air. Great mix of locals and expats. A must see on the the way through.

477 In Town for a conference and spent some time searching for a place to have a drink. Uncovered Cinders after a detailed search but surprised that they weren't top of the search.

Owner, Warren, an extremely friendly and welcoming host! A range of beers to cater for taste and an even better selection of spirits for even the most discerning palate.

I started with a malty indiga (American craft) served with some dubiously crunchy (typically Korean) nuts and graduated through Guinness and Stella Artois to an extremely reasonably priced local lager. Even a selection of Scottish beers and islay malt whiskeys for the more selective drinker.

Would highly recommend the venue to anyone!

The Cider Bar has the Largest Burger in Songdo. In fact I've never left the Cider Bar hungry when I ate there. The Premium Long Island Ice Tea is a must try!

486 Staying nearby before heading to Daejeon I googled "craft beer" more in hope than expectation and this came up

Beer is very good quality in the modern style. Didn't eat there as we wanted some authentic Korean food. The owner, Warren, was good enough to walk us down to a hidden-away BBQ restaurant where he stayed to help with the ordering and the left us to it. We'd never have found the place otherwise. Good to see a proprietor understanding that this is a customer service business and going the extra mile to make folk feel welcome

488 I had one of the most stressful airport experiences I’ve ever dealt with, left the airport to find some drinks/food and stumbled across The Cinder Bar. The owner and his amazing bartender from Vietnam completely turned around my entire day. 5 minutes in I had a huge smile in my face from the friendliness of the staff. I had some drinks which were all great prices and a burger which was delicious. Perfect for if you have a layover that’s long enough to leave the airport but not long enough to go too far. Incredible place!

489 This bar is newly opened and is an offshoot of another bar of the same name in Incheon City.
Very much nicer than all of the sterile airport hotel bars around this area. A lively welcome from Warren Kidd, the owner, who asks your name and introduces you to everyone in the bar. Makes for easy conversation and a friendly atmosphere.
The bar staff keep the party and conversation going by joining in - with a focus on encouraging the buying of rounds of drinks ("ring the bell and buy everyone in the bar a drink"!). Great for the profits, but also great for the atmosphere created. Genuinely enjoyable and a fun atmosphere.
I didn't have any of the food, but it looked like decent bar food (burgers etc).
A highly entertaining evening, marred slightly by the feeling that everyone was being pushed into drinking more. One of the best bars that I have visited.

497 In a land of cookie cutter bars and franchises, this quaint bar stands out and demonstrates how to "do it right". Take all of the items from a normal bar, add a superior sampling of alcohol choices and a friendly staff who bring customer service to the next level. Mix these things together and you get a bar that performs, where the seats are always warm because nobody wants to leave. Awesome place. I'm glad it is in Songdo because if it were anywhere else, this place would have a line spilling out into the street and you'd never get a seat. The music is top notch as well.

Squash is virtually non existent, golf is too expensive, but the Cinder Bar , oh the Cinder Bar. From the first moment I entered the doors of this small bar, I realised it had a huge heart. The guy who runs it tirelessly is Warren, a guy who remembers everyone’s names. The beer selection is amazing ... 12 on tap and at least 12 different bottled ales. The food is simple , but wholesome and tasty. Do not visit Songdo, without checking the Cinder Bar out.

547 Since moving to Korea in January 2017, this is by far the best spot in the area!! There is a great mix of local, expats and travelers passing through Incheon/Songdo leading to a "never know who you might run into" evening.

The location is a bit hidden for a first-timer, but that adds to the mystique. Once there, the interior is intimate and welcoming. There's also additional seating upstairs and a recently added dart machine for a fun competitive game with friends. And for spring and fall, there is outdoor seating as well (you will appreciate the air conditioning indoors during the Korean summer months!). Don't miss out on the monthly Trivia Night as well for a good time with co-workers or friends.

The food, with the recently expanded menu, is always great. Remember, the Cinder Bar is a bar, so the menu is very appropriate, but don't let that fool you in terms of quality and taste! My personal favorites are the colonel chicken sandwich and wings...which remind of wings from back in the US. The burger, fish sandwich, fish & chips and fries are also favorites and give a variety of choices. Cost is very reasonable and appropriate.

On to the beer....the Cinder Bar offers a dozen or so beers on tap and countless bottled beers. The tap selection is vast from Asia-Pac to Europe to US to local craft and includes many types (pilsner, stout, IPA, porter, wheat, etc.). The whiskey selection is also extensive with many of my favorite single malt Scotches!

And lastly, the services is always phenomenal, which is the main reason I return. Warren, the owner, and his staff are always welcoming to both regulars and first time visitors. He goes out of his way to introduce himself and get to know his patrons.

So if you've relocated to Songdo or happen to be passing through, I recommend an evening at the Cinder Bar.

548 Cinder Bar is the best place in Songdo to chill out, meet new people, and enjoy some quality international beers. Oh wait, did I mention they also make the best burger in town?!

Cinder is run by absolute legend Warren, along with his mate Sam. These guys are hard-working, honest Kiwi blokes who always put their customers first. Warren even arranged free tickets to the baseball for me!

I’ve spent the past 6 months living in Songdo and visiting this bar on a semi-frequent basis. When I moved here I didn’t know anybody. Now I’m leaving Korea and most of the people I know have all been Cinder Bar contacts through Warren.

They show the baseball, rugby and many other sports, not to mention live bands and quiz nights. This place has all the hallmarks of a western style bar, but with a genuine Korean welcome.

Highly recommend you pay a visit any day of the week - oh and say hi to Warren and Sam for me!

Keep up the good work lads!

549 I have travelled all over the world, been to countless bars, pubs, and restaurants..

The best way to describe the Cinder Bar is it's all of the above wrapped into a perfect little package of great times, exceptional drinks and tasty food, all in a warm, extremely welcoming atmosphere!!

Warren, and the entire staff at the Cinder are excellent people and extremely personable. They will go above and beyond to ensure that if you arrive a stranger, you'll certainly leave as a friend. This is clearly evident by patrons who return time after time again.

These people, this place is clearly special, and truly one in a million!!

Hope to see you at the Cinder Bar soon!
- Cheers!!

550 I had a little trouble finding the place but once I did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet. Amazing! The beer was ice cold and served in good portions. Beer price was a little steep for me but I hit happy hour just right so I got a bit of a break. Totally satisfied. Pro tip if you are trying to find it: if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it's on the left side of the street before the bridge. It's in a bit of an alcove in a housing development. Set back off the road a tad. There's a sign the points left and I made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road. Unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it. Obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it's the first set of building after the bridge on the right. The staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice. The fish and chips are phenomenal. Did I mention the fish and chips are great. You should definitely try the fish and chips.

553 I was on business in Korea, and my work colleagues took me out for a beer after work. Arrived at The Cinder Bar, which was my friend's regular. Primarily because it is one of the few true Expat Pubs in all of Incheon. The Kiwi, Warren, runs the Pub, and he was most hospitable. We settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely. Even had time for some fish and chips: the fish was covered in golden batter, and the chips were delicious. The bar looks a little broken down (as was the area it was located in), but that added to the charm. If it was a rugby night, you could watch the TV, but it would've been a bit of a squeeze. There was also an upstairs, loft-style area.
Overall, a pleasant evening after work.

554 Cozy bar with a very good selection of craft beers, both on tap and in the bottle. The owner, Warren, is very friendly and makes you feel welcome the moment you step in the door. It is easy to find and is popular with the locals and the expat crowd. Opens late and stays open late.

555 Great expat bar. The owner, Warren, is a friendly Kiwi who will remember your name from the first time you visit. Good beer selection. Great cocktails. And the kitchen is getting better every month. A very international crowd here.

556 I stopped in at the suggestion of coworkers. I wasn't disappointed. Warren (the owner) gave me a warm greeting and took very good care of me. The bar was a mix of local and expat patrons. Great selection of beer and although I didn't eat here, from what I saw the food looked very good (western style) and people seemed to enjoy it.

I'll definitely go back the next time I'm in Incheon.

The drink prices are very good and the food prices are great too! Warren, the owner, speaks English and Korean so he talks to everybody. He is so popular that he could be the future mayor of Incheon.

The music here is always good and the service is always excellent. You have to come here.

562 What a find the Cinder Bar is! Amid the high rise buildings stuffed with expensive restaurants, massage places, doctor's offices and just about everything else in this city there is a much better option. The Cinder Bar is located on the ground level at the last building on the left side of the road just before the bridge as you leave Incheon for the airport. Warren and his new partner Sam have crafted this cozy establishment into a welcoming, warm and friendly place to have a nice meal and a brew or two. If you are in the mood, they also have a superior selection of single malt whiskeys. The prices are the best you will find in Incheon and the atmosphere is unmatched. The food is excellent as well. This is a family affair and Warren's wife is the establishment's cook. Of particular note is the new hamburger offered which is a new collaboration between Warren and "The Flying Chef". It's easily the best burger in town. Should you decide to give the Cinder Bar a try I can guarantee you will have a new favorite hangout on your list.

565 I was at a conference in Korea earlier this month and I was invited to this bar because one of the guys playing in the band was also at our conference. With other people from the conference, we went there and I had a great time. The music was great, the drinks were great and the vibe there was very chill and positive. Warren, who I think is the owner, was talking to us and making conversations with us and made us feel like we had been there before. If I ever go back to Korea, I'd definitely go there again.

566 Cinder bar is a great bar to visit when in Songdo. It can be found near the center of the city by the bridge. There is a good selection of beers and other drinks and Warren is always thinking about bringing in new ones.

The owner, Warren, is very friendly and open. There are often quiz nights, music and other events going on.

A great place to meet people as well.

It's worth a visit.

568 I have been coming to this bar since late 2015 and I must say that I am continually impressed by the motivation and innovation of the staff here. From a continually expanding drink menu, which will have you staring at the pages for hours, to the jazz nights and their trivia night, Cinder bar and its crew make every visit unique. As a long time customer it is hard to be unbiased but the only advice I can offer is that whether you want to just go out and meet some new people, prop up on a bar stool and down beers or sit at table and have some cocktails.. Cinder is the only way to go.

569 The night I chose to check out this place happened to be Warren's (the owner's) birthday, the entire bar was more than happy to help him celebrate. The people are extremely friendly, when I first arrived I assumed that everyone in the bar were old friends. I was traveling alone and it didn't take very long before a group invited me to hang out with them at their table. Turns out most people had just met that night everyone was just mingling. I definitely recommend stopping in at Cinder Bar.

570 The Cinder Bar is a fantastic place to stop and make some new friends. Warren is the owner. Chances are he will personally greet you and make you feel like a long lost friend. The patrons are a great mix of local and westerners, very friendly. He has all the liquid refreshments you could hope for and a satisfying menu. I had a shrimp platter that was delicious. Aircrew are always welcome. Give it a try.

576 Okay, so here we are in Incheon and we want a cold beverage and something to eat. We've been here quite a few times and haven't been too lucky. We check out Trip Advisor and guess who's #1, Cinder Bar! We're reading the reviews and Warren, the owner's name keeps popping up. We head out to find The Cinder Bar.
We walk in and are instantly greeted by, guess who? Warren! He is one passionate and friendly man. He wants us to enjoy ourselves. The music was so great. We were hungry and he recommended a few items and they were delicious.
Warren is known for his famous gin and tonic, I'm not a fan of gin. He insisted we try just one, which we shared. I slurped it down and now I like gin and tonics.
We ordered his homemade dip and chips, chicken wings and fish and chips. All very, very good.
Warren, we're spreading the word, we had so much fun!

585 Cinder Bar is one of the most hospitable bar/foreign bar I know in Incheon. It is located in the out skirt of Dream City, Incheon, near the bridge. Warren, the owner is kind, generous, respectful, and so are the rest of his crew. This is the first and only review I have written on my own for any travel site, and I will say this bar is a great place to make new and promising friends. You will get to meet some great people, many of whom are regulars there like myself... not saying I drink to often, but that I enjoyed hanging out with people from the bar. Not only is this bar a great meet up for old friends or new friends, but even other bar owners or restaurant come here to have a great time.

586 After being recommended to go here by foreigners and Koreans alike I made the trip here (it's about an hour from where I live). Easy enough to find...keep the starbucks on your left and walk straight and pick up the sign!
I was instantly made welcome by Brandon the doorman who showed me in and sat me down at the bar. The owner Warren asked me what I was after drinkwise n made some excellent recommendations...all were consumed and were expertly made!
Warren has made an excellent atmosphere and the customers were all in on it. I arrived alone but left with the intention of going back and continuing to meet great people.

I can't recommend here enough...alone or in a group you will have a fun time. And check out the g n t's! From an English man, they hit the spot and more.

Thanks to all they guys at the cinder for a great time n I'll be seeing you again!

587 The Cinder Bar features some of the best mixed drinks I've ever tasted. Ask for the Gin and Tonic, or signature Long Island Ice Tea made with all top-shelf ingredients! The best part of this bar though is that Warren and his staff take time to get to know you. When you come back, they remember your name and you can practically pick up your last conversation where you left off, even if its been awhile. You feel like you're among friends from the moment you step through the door. Don't miss out on this great spot in Songdo!

We took a taxi there and the taxi driver spoke to the owner for directions. I never expected the Irish Owner to speak perfect Korean, but apparently he does. And then, get this, he waited outside for our taxi to arrive. Could he be nicer? NO. Could he have made a more inviting place for visitors to grab a drink and have a chat? No. Warren, you are a rock star and your bar is deserving of every 5 star review it gets. Like we told you that night -- we want to franchise you!

All in all, this is a great place and the only actual bar where you can sit up on a stool and pound a few pints. Take my word, you are going to want to atleast stop by here once.

The prices are incredible compared to other bars in Korea. The best part is the incredible atmosphere. The music is great and the everyone is incredibly welcoming. Especially Warren the owner and bartender of this place.

PS Order the Cinderella. Its on the secret menu. I can garantee that you will love it.

609 Irrespective of whether you are a local, an expat living in Korea or just passing through the area, you really should be visiting The Cinder Bar. Put simply, you won't find a warmer welcome, a nicer atmosphere or a more enjoyable environment to spend an evening in.
The thing that really stands out about the place is that the team there are clearly genuinely interested in you having a good time whilst you are there and go out of their way to show warmth and friendliness, irrespective of if you are a regular or a visitor from out of town.
Food is tasty, drinks are excellent, cocktails are made with care and attention to detail. Prices are extremely reasonable, too.
The really nice thing about the place is that the positivity is infectious! Not only are the staff incredibly friendly and helpful, but this rubs off on the clientele, too. It really does feel like a little community!
If you are looking to spend an enjoyable time in the area, this is the first place to visit.

612 After trying to find a bar that suited our needs, we were directed to Cinder bar. We were welcomed by friendly staff and the host with the most Warren Kidd from NZ. Who welcomed us with a smile and stories to go with. We managed to watch the NRL grand final with all having a great time and bringing more friends. The chicken wings to die for and the mini sliders that helps the famished traveller. Beers on tap are, Stella Artois and max but never leave the place without trying the famous cinders flaming shot with Warren(host) explaining the process. Most westerners drink here. Bar staff are well mannered, trained and speak English. This cozy, warm, fun and cool place with a selection of music that will tickle your ears and suitable for all ages and its home away from home. Cinder bar can order your cab for you and Warren is happy to escort you and being fluent in Korean able to show off his skills with local knowledge conversing with the driver able to direct the driver to your final destination. I have attached two photos with address and direction from the business card. Smoking & Drinking is permitted outside but be aware of noise as neighbours are living near by. I have had many happy memories there and have met people from around the world there. It's not a nite club but more like a pub. Somewhere to relax, unwind, have a chat, catch up, and have a beer. I have given a 5 star rating for excellence in every aspect of service from the moment you walk in. It's so hard to leave. To Warren and Staff, thank you for everything on behalf of Rocket, Thor aka Thoro aka Tom. Signing off,

I was studying abroad in Songdo for about a year, and I can easily say that going to The Cinder Bar made me feel right at home and also very welcomed in a country/place that I was new to. Warren is not only kind, but also innovative. The food is delicious. I can't get enough of the fry dip! And he always had a new drink recommendation for me and my friends that we always loved! He is always reaching higher and making The Cinder Bar a fun, exciting, and comfortable place to meet up with friends and enjoy the night. Highly Recommend! Definitely swing by!

The interesting range of drinks available traverse the globe too, from serving Korea's Maxx, new Zealand beers and decent Scotch whiskey to Manhattans and Warrens' signature cocktails... and now you can enjoy tasty food there too. Would I recommend a visit? Definitely, from meeting people in the community and watching a rugby match to having a quiet drink, this bar has it all... and the playlist pleases too! Probably why it's been our local for over a year.

622 I first came here back in May, and now I am one of the regulars. I love it! Some of my new best friends I met at the Cinder Bar!

The owners, Warren and Hanna, are always lovely and are introducing new Cinderites to us all the time.

The drink selection is fantastic. I personally enjoy the Monteith's selection from New Zealand; especially the Radler!!
Food-wise, the wings are my favorite, but it's the Cinder sauce that make them absolutely divine!!

The Cinder Bar is the new mover and shaker in the city of Songdo.
Check it out.... NOW!

623 The beer is reasonably priced including a few New Zeeland made beers you can't get anywhere else in Songdo. If you are feeling hungry they offer a couple options including some killer wings that come with a their own unique 'Cinder Sauce'. The real highlight of Cinder Bar is the service, the owner Warren is there every night and he is by far the best bartender in Incheon, he is warm friendly, and never let's an empty glass sit. Despite being born in New Zeeland he has lived in Korea long enough to speak fluent Korean. Because of this the atmosphere is unique it's not just a 'foreigner bar', every member of the Cinder crew can speak English and Korean so both locals and foreigner mingle in roughly equal proportions.

625 From now on when I travel to Korea, I'll be visiting Cinder Bar! Warren the owner was so friendly and welcoming, and I certainly felt very comfortable socializing with all the great people who go there. Great food, great drinks and all round a fantastic night! If your in Korea, this is a must visit!

626 After being in Korea for about 2 weeks on business I was getting a little tired of endless Korean food. Had a night by myself and found this place down the sheet from my hotel. The owner greeted me at the door and found me a seat at the bar. Had a great conversation with the bar tender, owner and a few of the other patrons. The food was excellent and the beer selection very different than the surrounding bars. Highly suggest asking the owner for his recommendations.

627 Initially, we had some trouble finding the place. It's tucked around in back of the building, not in the front. We called and Warren's wife came around the block to meet us and lead the way! How's that for service???

Warren came over and welcomed us immediately upon arrival, making us feel right at home. He asked us about our normal drink preferences, then made some suggestions and headed off to get them.

We tried several different beers and of course, had some pub grub. The burgers and shrimp scampi are great!! Good portions and lots of options to wash it all down.

We met serval of the locals/regulars, who are all super friendly and fun to hang with.

All in all, a great time with great food!! Also, wonderful owners who truly enjoy taking care of their customers and doing everything they can to make your experience a great one!!

639 I can't really say enough about this establishment. The atmosphere and the staff's enthusiasm makes this a "must see" while in Songdo. The food is great, the beer selection is spot on, and the conversation is second to none. I frequent this pub every time I travel to Korea. So, get off your duff and mosey on down to the Cinder Bar. Oh, and ask for the killer Cinder (gin) and Tonic.

642 Had an overnight layover in Incheon and was looking for a spot to get out of the airport as we had a room at the transit hotel. After getting a stamp on our boarding card from the airline (needed!), we were allowed to leave the airport. Warren, the owner, gave our Uber driver directions on how to get to the bar (20 min from the airport). Kitchen open late for fish/chips and wings. Great alcohol selection (IPA imported from the U.S. on tap!) Great spot and will come back next time we have an overnight layover on Delta or Korean Air. Great mix of locals and expats. A must see on the the way through.

643 In Town for a conference and spent some time searching for a place to have a drink. Uncovered Cinders after a detailed search but surprised that they weren't top of the search.

Owner, Warren, an extremely friendly and welcoming host! A range of beers to cater for taste and an even better selection of spirits for even the most discerning palate.

I started with a malty indiga (American craft) served with some dubiously crunchy (typically Korean) nuts and graduated through Guinness and Stella Artois to an extremely reasonably priced local lager. Even a selection of Scottish beers and islay malt whiskeys for the more selective drinker.

Would highly recommend the venue to anyone!

648 Went here for a family birthday and got platter of meat to share. I enjoyed the simple combination of really good meat with fresh Asian-style salad- which the staff were always quick to top up.

I felt that some of the meats could have come with more sauces or marinades but it was my first time having Korean barbecue style and maybe that's normal- I don't know but I'd be eager to try more and find out!

650 We visit this restaurant when we are in Edinburgh, we love the food, we love the people and we just love sitting as a family cooking our meats on the grill in the table. The endless salad is just delicious, the starters are fantastic especially the Takoyaki (octopus) and then we always have the D-set menu of mixed meats - pork belly, marinated pork, marinated beef, marinated chicken and little steaks. Fabulous! Will see you again soon.

656 Walked in when they opened at 5pm. Place became busy after a few minutes. Uber driver guessed that we were going to a Korean restaurant as he said the street is a quiet street but he has dropped off a few passengers there so must be good he said. We had Korean BBQ that came with side dishes and Kimchi Jigae. Great tasting, good quality meat. Simple decor in the restaurant but I was after good food. Staff attentive and helpful. Recommended place.

658 Very disappointing.
We arrived Sunday late afternoon, the staff could not have been more disinterested. Despite only a few tables occupied the waitress was more interested in talking to other staff members than take our order.
The restaurant was physically cold. A couple at the next table had to put on their outdoor coats after ordering.
The (electric) grill took an age to warm up, and when the food arrived (full meat platter) half of it was still frozen, obviously previously band saw freezer cut -- no marinade. For a restaurant that claims to be a barbaque, the meat was given shockingly no thought, oddly butchered cuts that could not be cooked without undercooking one half or overcooking the other.

Service continued to be at best minimal. The grill was occasionally manned by a member of staff (taking away the one gimmick the style of cuisine has) who left without any word. When we took to cooking our own cuts of meat, we were sternly told on how to operate the grill as we obviously missed the 12 week preparatory course for dining.

We left with most of the meal uneaten- the waitress did not ask why or if the meal was saitisfactory. I'd like to personally apologise for interrupting her 8 hour paid social club.

If the idea of being exposed to cooking yourself is some kind of wild evening entertainment and you don't mind that there are far better places to actually eat, I'd highly recommend "Korean BBQ".

Compared to kbbq in other cities we have travelled to, this one was definitely more affordable and worth the price.

663 Started off goodish they took full order then 5 mins later said had no chicken skewers for starters so we both took chicken dumplings then while ordering food started telling me I was ordering too much I was ordering for 3 people strange. The dumplings were good except one person asked for veg dumpling but got chicken. It’s a birthday she didn’t complain then the bbq food started to arrive but one of hot plates would only go to number two a warm setting when we complained as food was poaching not browning were told they knew it was broken so just use other one for 8 people we asked to move then every member of staff stood round our table telling us it will heat up give it time eventually they tried to intimidate us with restaurant and kitchen crew huddling round us. They said give us 2 separate tables then they were shouting tried to move another table threw the cooking food on top of the raw food aggressively....at that point we said we wanted to leave and they had spoiled his birthday. We found a better staffed restaurant to celebrate and will never eat there again.

664 This is where I always enjoy Korean food the most. Always been in the Tarvit street branch. I was never disappointed. Food quality is great. I tried bbq sets and bulgogi dishes so far. They were always really tasty. Last time I got beef bulgogi, seafood pancake (that I adore) and a soup. Everything was just great. Little space, so if you don't book sometimes it's a bit of a risk. But it's really easy to book online. The service was great, everyone always friendly and welcoming. really nice a cosy atmosphere. It's not the cheapest place to eat but the quality is outstanding that every single penny is worth it. I really look forward to try the new branch as well. This place never disappoint.

669 We brought a few friends who had never tried a korean BBQ before and they were very impressed by the food! It was reasonably priced, we got some things for the grill and a main meal which was very filling. The side dishes were excellent and the servers were very good about changing the grill often for us. A good time to go would be earlier on in the evening when it isn't too busy as the staff were very attentive and efficient. Will definitely be back!

670 My husband and myself went this evening as a walk in;I assume it was busy with reservations as we were asked if we could be out by 8pm and this was just turned 7pm. No one really explained why. We ordered 1 starter which came very quickly as did the drinks. My main came 10 mins before my husbands but I assume as his was fried this was the reason for the delay. No one explained why. The food was very tasty, drinks a good variety and reasonably priced. Cannot really comment on staff as not a lot of interaction. After our mains we asked for the bill as it was 7:40 and did not look at desert/coffee menu. Would definitely come back but would reserve a table at a less busy time.

671 I visited with my partner for his first time having Korean bbq and my first time in this country (I have had this many times before as I used to live in South Korea.) We ordered a mixed meat plate which came with two beers for £42 and we ordered rice and kimchi as well. The food was plentiful and offered a good mix. The lettuce, sauces and sides were topped up for free. The service was excellent with frequent grill changes and the food compared favourably to bbq I have eaten in South Korea. My partner very much enjoyed his first Korean bbq and would come again. I was initially a bit apprehensive as it was empty (at 5pm) and doesn't have a great exterior but I am glad we came in. Highly recommended, I just wish we'd had space for the kimchi pancake!

672 I'm in two minds about this place. Staff were friendly, it was packed and some of the food was very nice and the salads plentiful. The first time in the UK that I've tasted kimchi which actually had some kick to it. The pudding menu is very limited but some really unusual flavours - black sesame or red bean ice cream anyone? However some of the meat wasn't well cut & was therefore awkward on the barbeque and the overall value of the barbeque was poorer tan some I've had. Dishes arrived a little haphazardly and one a couple of times things were forgotten though came quickly after a prompt. Overall a pleasant evening but wouldn't go out of my way to come here again when there is so much other choice in the city.

This was brilliant we got a mixed meat platter for £20.00 each we received free top up sides and beer each.the meat was lovely and it was a really nice way to eat.

675 I've had Korean BBQ before. Its not really my thing since I can cook reasonably well at home so there's little fun in doing this in a restaurant. However my teenage daughters fondness for K-Pop made her ask to go here. We went. Table was OK. Place was light and airy. We saw about twelve ingredients on display for the customers to add to their meals. Soy and chili, coriander, spring onions, oyster sauce, two red bean sauces and so on. Nothing really exotic and nothin particularly Korean. Supermarkets have most of these ingredients nowadays. We ordered tempura starters and although huge and expensive for starters they weren't awfully good. Tempura batter was darker, oilier and heavier than the best I've had. Particularly for the prawns. My veg tempura was a little better but still not great. We ordered beef mains. Meagre portions considering other places in Edinburgh offer more variety. We got three bowls of lukewarm sticky rice which was more "badly made" than actually sticky. I can make better at home and I expect better from restaurants. I won't come here again. The Korean beer we wanted was out of stock. Our starters arrived several minutes apart and the nice waiting staff told me the kitchen was busy. There was about ten more diners in the place than we three. We had pints of Diet Coke each. Bill was pricey for what we received although average for the typical fare. Sadly this place was below par.

Ask if you don’t want it too spicy or ask for extra if you like it a little hotter. Free sides dishes. Good Korean tea snd the seafood pancake delicious. Cash only. Will make a return visit. Opening offer 10% off the bill. Gunbae.

679 I went here with my friend during the winter for Korean BBQ, true to its name.

The beef BBQ I ordered was way too salty and the some was the meat was not marinated. The amount of meat was too little in comparison to its price and other Korean restruants in the city.

The waiters were not friendly and when the chef came out to greet us, he was really...odd and we felt really uncomfortable due to his attitude towards us.

Don't think we want to come back here again.

685 We found this restaurant just by googling and we were very impressed! We ordered set D, which was a great combination of really fresh meat and was great if you're not sure what to order. The side dishes were delicious too, especially the salad and the marinated beansprouts, and the sauce was so tasty. We ordered rice as well, but it really wasn't necessary as the set itself is a very generous portion for 2 hungry full-grown men! I have, sadly, never been to Korea, but I have eaten at barbecue restaurants in the Korean district of Tokyo and this competes with the best of them. The staff were very attentive and friendly, and keen to recommend delicious, authentic combinations of meat and side dishes. All this for a very reasonable price - we'll definitely be back!

We just randomly walked in, seeing many people there so we really thought this should be a good place for food. However, the food there made us soooo disappointed. We ordered four dishes and none of them tasted okay. The BBQ source was so weird and the beef was not fresh at all! As for the beef soup, I would say they destroyed every thing. It was so slight and there was not enough ingredients inside. All in all, I don’t recommend it. This restaurant is unqualified.

690 We ate at this Korean BBQ Restaurant the other night with friends (You cook your own food if you pick a BBQ dish).
Service was very mixed, girl waitress was excellent, organised and efficient, but the other staff not quite so, some were just lazy. Asked to get table cleared after main course, as they left it on table for 20 mins, even though the restaurant was quieter. The youngest staff cleared 1/4 of table, after requested, then proceeded to stand around and do nothing for next 10 mins. Eventually got table cleared, including glasses with wine remaining in them, after requesting again. Awful attention to guests.
Food was a different case. BBQ chicken was a generous portion, BBQ Prawns not so, only 6 medium prawns for the money. Stir-Fry was generous portion and tasty.
Restaurant really has to sort out service, as we left thinking there are better Korean BBQ restaurants near-by, so why would we go here again.
Tip should be given in cash, if added to VISA, staff do not get it, owner told me which is fair enough. If cash they get it (Legal requirement in UK anyway).

693 Three of us went for dinner, having the kimchi pancake (very generous with the kimchi, and not too spicy if that’s something you’re worried about), the BBQ Set D and the Naengmyun (Cold noodles in a vinegar broth). The pancake was delicious and probably the best I have had outside of Korea! And the set includes a variety of 5 cuts of meat (the pork neck slice is especially tender and delicious) and 2 beers of your choice, this was an extremely generous portion and undoubtedly worth the price - a great option if you’re new to KBBQ and aren’t sure what cuts to order. The set also comes with all you need for Ssam (lettuce wraps) and the side dishes are also of a great quality (and are refilled for free if you ask). The naengmyun is also probably the best I’ve ever had, I highly recommend!! The service was great - very attentive and friendly, explaining how to use the bbq and changing out the grill halfway through to a cleaner one (something I was very impressed by, as many Korean restaurants don’t do that in the U.K). Overall I was extremely impressed, and would even consider it the best Korean restaurant I’ve been to outside of Korea!

697 Haven't tried Korean food in a Korean restaurant before, and was thoroughly impressed.
We visited on a Saturday evening but however, I DID NOT reserve a table. So my advice would be to do so as it was busy. I managed to get a slot at 8 o'clock and eagerly returned.
The atmosphere was electric, the bbq's which acted as a lively centrepiece for each table, were producing an enticing aroma which elevated our appetite.
We ordered the sirloin to BBQ and the rice cakes. The sirloin was nicely marbled and marinated in a delicious sauce. It was served with lettuce leaves, kimchi, salad and bean sprouts. All were delectable.
The rice cakes were chewy and tasty. Perhaps a little too sweet for my liking as I prefer hot, spicy food but still so delicious.
We got octopus balls and dumplings for starters which were both so incredibly yummy.
Nothing was disappointing. I can't say a bad word. All customers were smiling and laughing. The staff were incredibly helpful and polite. The pricing was extremely fair.
An excellent meal and a great introduction to Korean cooking.

699 Out in Edinburgh for a gig and decided to try something a wee bit different than the usual pub grub and have to say I was very impressed with what was our first ever Korean BBQ. We went for the the BBQ set meal D for 2 which came with to beers and prices at £38:80 was great value for what was served up. The only thing that we made a mistake on was not ordering side dishes of rice/noodles as wasn’t sure what the set meal came with..lol the Wee bbq plate in the middle of the table was quick to heat up and did not make the dining area to hot to enjoy your meal. The marinaded beef slice was outstanding and watch out for the chicken as it’s bloody spicy (well for my mouth anyway..lol) this restaurant is very busy and we were lucky to get a table for 2 not long after opening time so I would suggest phoning to make a reservation to make sure you’re not disappointed..

701 Uninspiring looking from outside but I am glad someone had recommended it to me. You barbecue your food on a grill in the table and staff were very helpful explaining how to do it. Delicious flavours that were new to my palate. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

703 The food here is honestly amazing and I have been here twice with friends and family. I order Bbq items each time I go and the Spicy squid and chicken and pork are nice but the spicy chicken is slightly overpriced as you only get 2 slices. Sometimes it is hard to catch the attention of the staff but the people here are really friendly.

704 This was my third visit. I have nothing negative to say. The restaurant doesn’t look much from outside but once your inside the number of Asian people who were dining speaks for itself. It is very busy and booking is essential. The food is amazing. Everything tastes different. Even the free salad. I would recommend this restaurant 100%

705 A wonderful family meal for 4. We had the 'D-Set' meat selection from the menu which was certainly enough for 4 of us. The meat were all very tender and marinates were delicious. The side dishes were all superb too, salads, radish and I ordered extra kimchi which was delicious. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. The value for the quality that we received was very good indeed.

706 One of the best Korean BBQs I've visited - their bulgogi marinade is absolutely on point, and the kimchi pancake was wonderful.

We ordered the mixed meats set menu for 2 and were treated to a quick overview of how to cook our food (we'd been to a Korean BBQ before so didn't need the full demonstration). Our grill plate was frequently refreshed, and all the meat was absolutely top quality. The pancake appetizer took awhile to come out, but we were given a bowl of amazingly tangy kimchi to make up for the wait - perfect spice, great texture and flavour.

The staff is charming and helpful and the food was perfectly composed.

Finish off your lettuce and sauces? No problem - they'll bring you more right away!

If you enjoy cooking and like to "play with your food," this is a perfect night out. Just be sure to come with an appetite - that set meal for 2 is really enough for 3 or even 4 people!!

708 I'm a huge fan of Korean food and have been in too many Korean restaurants to count in many cities (Dublin, Tokyo, Osaka, Austria, London, Manchester, Seoul etc..), and this one is a definite 5 star. It was very authentic, we were also the only two non-Korean people in the entire restaurant which was full and booked out for the night, which must mean that this place is the real deal!

We ordered the Kimchi pancake and tofu bibimbap, both of which tasted just like in Korea, I savoured every bite! Not all Korean restaurants outside Korea seem to give the complimentary starters, but Korean BBQ does, which was great.

The prices were standard, each main ranging around £10-12. The service was efficient and good, no complaints.

A word of warning, this place is extremely popular, even on weekdays. We came on a Saturday to find it booked out so I made a reservation the following Monday online, which was ok. While we were there, the place was a full house and the waitress was turning down those without reservations as it was booked out until around 8:30pm.

The online booking is easy and quick, it fills up fast. I booked two days in advance for a Monday night, and the latest available was 6:30pm, with nothing available any later. So I advise booking quite a bit in advance or be ready to eat either early or late, as the 7-9pm times seem to get taken fast as the restaurant is small and seems to be very popular with Koreans in Edinburgh as well as tourists and locals.

709 We had a reservation but turned out it wasn't needed. The food was great, overall good value, the service could've been a bit faster. The kimchi was a bit more sour than spicy and not as crunchy, but it's up to personal taste. I think they could serve kimchi as a complimentary sider to the bbq, as they would also in Korea. Some music would be nice.

711 This is one of your typical grill your own Korean places. Meat is fresh. Portions are large and the prices are reasonable. Only 3 sides with the meat less than what I usually get. They could also use another server but overall a good non tourist experience.

712 My friend visited from the USA, where there are many Korean BBQ places. She took me here to experience it and we were very happy. Food is good, very filling, and the staff are friendly. When we arrived we were told the small restaurant was full, but instead of just turning us away the staff took my contact number and called us when a table became free. A very nice idea, meaning we could explore a bit more!

713 I love this place and remind me a BBQ place in Daegu that I used to go to. The meat choices are great and we had a lot of fun cooking and it’s a good chat. Waiter was so kind to offer extra salad if we needed more. Side salads taste great. Will recommend.

714 I had never been to a "Korean BBQ" before, so the entire experience was new to us. Luckily the staff is very friendly and helpful, and they were there to assist us in "preparing" our meal! You have a heating plate built into the center of each table, on which you "barbecue" your own food (meat, prawns, etc.), or you can order one of the prepared stir-fried dishes. One of us had the BBQ, and the other got stir-fried. We both extremely enjoyed our meals. Whether you have stir-fried or BBQ, the "Korean way" of eating it is by placing some of your cooked meal on a lettuce leaf, adding some of the condiments they bring you (spicy radish/bean sprouts/sauce), rolling it up, and eating the roll. Very tasty, and a fun/interesting way to eat, to boot! The prices were also quite reasonable. Highly recommended!

716 Although it is an electric bbq in the centre of the table, this is still a great experience. Good menu with choices with selections for two that was adequate for three of us. Food comes raw and you cook it yourself to your liking. The grill is changed regularly so you don’t have to deal with burnt scraps. Although the waiter was attentive in that respect, they were a bit slow with us having to ask to clear the table, ask for the dessert menu, ask to order our dessert and then ask for the bill only to have go to the counter to pay in order to get our taxi. However, would still recommend that you give it a try.

717 If it wasn’t for the reviews of this place we wouldn’t have tried it.

Looks not a lot from the exterior but the whole experience of having your own personal BBQ on you table to the delicious meats you can try it was absolutely fantastic, definitely worth a visit if looking for something different!

We booked a table for around 4pm which in our opinion was a great time, not too busy and you didn’t feel rushed. staff were very helpful and even called us a taxi to the Playhouse after our meal, which was fantastic and saved us a very wet walk through the city.

If you are looking for something different from a chain restaurant and a little taste of Korean Food then definitely take a trip here - you’ll love it!

721 I went here with my daughter and two of her friends from University In California. Anna who is from South Korea did the honours and ordered for all of us.

Great ribeye, short rib and marinated fillet. Accompanying pickled veg was excellent. Lots of soft fluffy rice. The chilli paste was very tasty as well.

If you like Korean and you love BBQ beef then give it a go. Value for money for four people.

722 I have been twice now and both times ordered a set of mixed meats, set D I believe, to bbq. Out of this the sliced beef is defiantly the best! The goyzas are also yummy.

Unlike when I have had Korean BBQ in Asia, here there are no extractors above the tables which does lead to a slightly smokey atmosphere and you defiantly leave smelling of a garlic-y bbq.
But all in all, a great find for some fun and tasty food.

723 After a colleague recommmeded this restaurant we decided to chance our luck with a last minute booking for seven of us.
The staff were very friendly and accommodating and fitted us in.
At our table we opted for a couple of mixed meat cook at table bbq dishes and all the meat was great! This was more than enough for four of us. The other three opted for their own dishes which also looked very appetising!
Great little find and I’m sure I’ll be back!

724 We went to this restaurant thanks to tripadvisor recommandations but we were very disapointed by the food. We ordered 2 C set (beef bbq for 2 people) and the quantity was very small. Plus the food was not very tasty... We were forced to have another D set (mixed meat for 2). This time there was enough quantity for 2 but the quality was not there... To conclude i would not recommend it. It was also a bit expensive.

725 Ate here before the theatre..a random week night in chilly Edinburgh at 6.00...no need to book, I thought. Well, as they had online booking decided I might as well and, although there was one free table, it looks like booking was a wise decision. It’s a small, cozy space with friendly staff who talked us through the menu as we had never eaten in a Korean restaurant before. Prawn starter was magnificent and easily enough for two, followed by the Korean BBQ, neatly fitted into the table top. A decent bottle of reasonably priced house wine...what’s not to like?

726 The smell which hits you as you walk through the door is similar to that of teriyaki which makes your mouth water!
We opted for bbq and ordered a set of mixed meats and also sliced beef accompanied by goyzas both chicken and vegetables plus an aubergine.
The bbq grill is electric and we felt was never sizzlingly hot (like in Asia where they are mostly gas powered). There are no extractors over the tables therefore the whole place is really smokey with 12 grills on the go! Your clothes will whiff.
The service was a little sporadic.
All in all pretty good for somewhere out of Asia.

732 Second visit here. Tuesday night and it's packed!
Last time, we got a BBQ for two, and starters, we only just managed to eat all this!!

This time, I opted for a stew, my ptnr went for some sort of spicy chicken thing, and we had dumpling starters and a kumchi side.

As last time, we got three different salads that came with the food, free refills of same which we made use of. Dressings in salad all different but are lovely sweet/sour/salty combos, go with everything!

Lots of Korean diners, and other folk who know their stuff, but I think you would be well looked after if you hadn't a clue - staff checked we were ok both visits, and checked if we wanted chopsticks or knife fork spoon.

Be aware that in common with many Korean restaurants, your clothes and hair will smell after!! Don't wear anything like a doen jacket that needs special cleaning.

We recently went to another, new, Korean bbq in Edinburgh but this place totally outguns it! 2 starters, 2 mains, side salads come with it, and we got a drink each, £40 total.

733 Visited with fiancé, one of my friends recommended me this restaurant. I wanted to eat something authentic, and this place was indeed authentic. The restaurant itself is not too big, but looks cozy. We tried 2 different kind of ramens, some kimchi, and korean green tea latte. The drink was amazing, the food even better! Their tempura is so tasty, I keep telling my man to go back to get more.
I would definitely recommend!

734 We had the Korean BBQ (menu D) for 2 people with 2 beers each and more than we could eat, all for under £50. The waiters were so friendly and helpful showing us how to use the BBQ and talking us through all the pickles and seasoning. The food was absolutely delicious and the Korean Beer was good too. At the end the staff called us a taxi - they couldn’t do enough to help. The only thing to note is that it was cash only so make sure you take enough cash with you but definitely go! Also it really would be hard for vegetarians.

735 My friends and I are regulars at KBBQ and although their normal dishes are very good, we love the Korean barbeque the most. It's super fun to cook the meat yourself, although if you're nervous the staff will jump in to help, or cook it for you if you prefer. Even as a group of students we find we can all leave full and happy for around £10-20 per person depending on how greedy we are about the meat selection! A great place to spend some quality time with friends or family and enjoy crazy tasty food all the while.

737 First visit and our family of four adults came as part of an evening out in Edinburgh to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday. The menu is varied - for both carnivores and vegetarian options. We tried the barbeque at the table - and this added to the experience as well as the flavor- with staff attentive and helpful, to make sure the food was prepared properly- cooked well but not singed and smokey. Marinades flavoursome with just the right amount of bite and side veg dishes crispy and tastey. We had dumplings and seaweed salad to start. Finished with black sesame ice cream I have travelled in Asia and experienced authentic local dishes and this was on par.
Smiling staff and service was great. We will definitely return- would be good for a light lunch or as we had- a full evening meal.

741 This place is amazing, to say the least. We'd never been to a Korean bbq before so didn't know what to expect, but what a great experience it was and we had such a great time. we ordered beef slices, king prawns, seaweed, two portions of rice and two grape juices; all of this coming with free sides and sauces. The beef and prawns were beautifully marinated and the staff was very helpful in showing us how to cook as it was our first time. The rice was excellent and the seaweed was as well (despite not liking it much myself). Would highly recommend getting the grape juice as well if you're looking for something non-alcoholic, tasted great and even had little grapes inside the can which added to the experience of a different culture. Overall, I must say that this place is a true wonder, with a great variety of food, friendly staff and excellent little details such as the metal chopsticks and drinks being served in their original can/bottle covered in Korean/Japanese writing; and for a very filling meal we only spent £30.

742 We didn't have a table booked but staff were happy to find us a table, can get busy at weekends so recommend booking. Nice menu lots of variety. We had some starters then had the BBQ banquet to share. You get your choice of meat brought to the table and you cook it to your preference on a BBQ/grill on your table. Meat was so fresh and tasty. Was served with lettuce leaves and rice to make a wrap. Staff so friendly and helpful. Food 10/10, we will definitely be back.

743 We were excited to find Korean barbecue place in Edinburgh. It was super busy with no available tables on the moment we went, but waiter kindly asked us to wait for 10-15 minutes. Finally we got our table and happily ordered beef bbq set for two. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with lots of little additional dishes as in South Korea does, but one has to order for extra fee. Our bulgogi tasted well, but it wasn’t that authentic though. For me the highlight was kimchi, that tasted very different from packaged ones. Waiters were quick and polite, thumbs up for them. Also it felt a bit expensive for what you get. Oh, and bare in mind your clothes will be soaked with smelly smoke for days, as everyone is grilling it’s own meat and there are no smoke extractors, unfortunately.

We will definitely be going back and this time we'll bring the whole family.And I'll be recommending Korean BBQ to everyone I know

749 Nice places and good food. We had the BBQ with 5 different kinds of meat, so we did most of the cooking ourselves as the meat was served raw and the table had a grill set into it. Vegetables, rice and sauces completed the meal. Great fun and very social way of dining.

754 We enjoyed our dinner a great deal. We thought the restaurant was very well priced and chose the Beef B selection for 2. We also got an order of Kim, Kimchi and Hot Beef Soup to share. We loved it all. The beef selection came with three types and they gave us three sides/lettuce/sesame oil with salt and chili paste. All were YUMMM. I had to order white rice as it doesn't come with the order, which from other places I've been to globally that was weird. My water glass came out with food on it, which was gross, but the server replaced it. We asked for a pitcher of water, but that never came. When it came time to pay it was hard to get a server and the restaurant at this point was not full. I would recommend the food and would go back for the food but the service could do a bit better.

Green Tea Ice cream was yummm and on point to what we had in Japan.

755 We are from the States so we have many Korean bbq places to choose from. We were a little nervous to try it, but the other reviews were positive. After a rough day of pulling suitcases up and down hills to get to our hotel, we had a delicious meal at this place. Food tasted fresh, staff was friendly and place was very clean. The only down side to this place and why I gave 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because they only took cash on the day we went. Not sure if this is a usual thing but they at least knew where the closest ATM machine was. Overall great place would definitely recommend it and would go back if we ever returned.

756 A nice atmosphere and good to see a Korean BBQ in Edinburgh this concept has potential if the food improves. Food was edible and pleasant enough, but I feel the chicken dish I ordered was miss sold by the waitress, she warned me the dish I ordered was very spicy, however, it was actually tasteless and bland not a hint of flavour or spice in my opinion.
Also the side dishes weren't very authentic and options to buy more sides were very limited e.g the only noodle option is udon.
If you're looking for good Korean in Edinburgh I'd recommend sodaeng as the best. Hope Korean BBQ is able to improve on authentic Korean flavours as I liked the look and feel of this restaurant.

759 Book a table well in advance, get e- mail confirmation.

Take train into Edinburgh, travel light with cash for a few beers, card to pay for meal.

Go see a Festival show in George Street and then 15 minute walk up to Tarvit Street.

Table ready for us, sit down handed menus, all good so far.

Just about to order and the wife spots the "cash only" sign at the till at the back of the restaurant. We ask the waitress if it was indeed cash only and she says "network was down".

Only have card with me so we have to sheepishly leave the restaurant.

Fair enough that the network was down (a first for me) but surely they could have emailed or phoned us to let us know?

As the Festival was on everywhere was full so had to head back to the train station hungry

761 Tiny bit off the main thoroughfare, and the frontage I think conceals a bit that the interior is really quite nice, but not to be missed.

Korean bbq is great because there's nothing like cooking the meat yourself then popping it in your mouth while it's still toasty hot. Vegetables also cook nicely too.

Staff were charming and very attentive. Nice touch that the chef popped out to check on everyone. Really surprised at the bill given how much meat we ate. We didn't drink much but it still felt good value.

We had the assorted meats bbq, and it was all great. Marinaded strips of beef were particularly nice. Will look forward to bulgolgi and bibimbap next time (other Korean specialties).

We couldn't eat everything, and they suggested themselves that we just cook up the rest and take it home. I often wish I could do that at restaurants but I'm too embarrassed to ask.

762 Went here the other night for dinner. Luckily we booked a table before as its a busy and small place. The starters were phenomenal and we ordered two of the bbq meats to share along with the veggies. The food was amazing! Its a normal Korean bbq where you cook your own meat at the table but the staff gave great tips on the best way to do it. Great sauces and side dishes to go with the meat as well. The staff was very helpful and so friendly! Would go back every week if I lived in Edinburgh!

763 Enjoyed our first Korean barbecue experience in this good value restaurant. It was quiet on a Tuesday night with only a couple of other tables occupied. Found the menu a bit confusing as a first-timer and should have chosen more salads/veg to go with the huge plate of meat we ordered to cook at the table, but the staff were reasonably attentive, refilling our glasses and swapping out the cooking plates regularly. A fun experience in a cosy local restaurant.

768 Visited with some friends recently after we'd all come back from working in South Korea and were missing the food.

Stepping inside and first getting that aroma we felt instantly back in Busan!

First off the staff were incredibly friendly and took loads of time to speak to us and were always on hand with anything we needed - even showing the correct way to make a so-maek (?)

The food was outstanding and I honestly don't think you'll find a better representation of the BBQ atmosphere of Korean restaurants in Scotland, or even the rest of the UK for that matter.

We had the assorted meat platter with some soup and it was plenty for 4. We also got some kimchi and again it's much better than you can buy in the shops.

No Korean night out would be complete without some Hite and some Soju and thankfully they have both ;o)

All in all we had a great night there due to a combination of fantastically attentive staff
And delicious food all in a great relaxed atmosphere.

I can't wait to go back - it's my new favourite restaurant.

769 Being a vegetarian, I was a bit sceptical about going to this place.And along with this I had never been to a Korean restaurant before. As soon as you enter, it smells so so good. Unfortunately very few vegetarian options and the 2 courses that I ordered were very ok for the price they were at. A special mention to the staff. They were so good. Great service, made us feel so comfortable and were always keeping a check in case we weren't sure about the BBQ. The chef had also come out once to check the bbq. My friend loved the food. But my food was ok and hence the 3 stars. Wish I could give more.

771 Had an excellent BBQ here. The place is spacious and clean. It had a good buzzing atmosphere and service was excellent which makes such a difference. Staff were friendly, helpful explaining how the BBQ worked and they all looked like they wanted to be there. BBQ was excellent and very reasonably priced. You can get just pork or beef or a mixed one. We got the mixture of pork, beef, chicken and came with 2 beers for £38. The experience and the meat itself was fantastic especially the sauces and the pickled vegetables- the marinated chicken and beef bulgogi were devine. If you're on the Atkins diet no danger here as the meats and vegetables are plentiful with no carbs in sight

I ordered a mixed meat set meal. The waiter suggested that this was a 3 person serving but since there were 2 of us, they would pack the remainder for take-away.

The mixed meat plater is accompanied by an array of side dishes from salad leaves to chilli paste. The platter itself held many differently marinaded cuts of meat (chicken pork and beef) All raw for you to cook yourself on the bbq grill situated in the centre of the table.

The meats were delicious and as we did not finish, the waiter packed up the remaining uneaten cook meats. We accompanies the meal with korean beer which was the perfect match.

For the uninitiated, this as a really fun way to dine, and something everone should try. It can get busy at the usual eating times so booking is advised. We ate after the lunchtime rush so was easy to get a table. I've already made a reservation for next Saturday and looking forward to it.
One last interesting point, the bbq meal consists of meats and veg so a carb free option, making it both delicious and healthy. A seafood option is available also.

Check it out, you will love it.

774 The staff greeted us warmly checking if we eaten at the restaurant and / or Korean food before...No and Yes. They asked if we needed help with the menu and also brought out complimentary sides which are also refilled for free which is a wonderful idea....not just because they're complimentary but because they tasted divine!!
It was my mum's first time eating Korean food and now recognises there was no need for apprehension. Every morsal was heavenly - our only disappointment was it was a light pre theatre dinner and we wanted to try more. 1st rate kimchi, salads are so flavoursome, the hot pot was amazing and katsu curry spot on.
I can't wait to come back for a full on bbq feast and try lots more. And its such an important note, the staff were friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there which is so refreshing. A real gem of a restaurant

775 My son and I visited after his ortho appointment for a lunch treat. I'm on a low-carb diet just now and have to be a picky eater. Korean BBQ was perfect as they brought suitable nibbles, then I had a pork belly kim chi soup with a side of rice (we took away) which was satisfyingly spicy and delicious. My son had chicken katsu (his favourite) and rice and said it was really good.
Service was lovely, small business, chef/owner, and great decor. Very reasonable price.
This little place is tucked at the side of the King's Theatre and so easy to miss, but don't. This food is perfect for pre-theatre as it's not heavy and so less likely to induce that post-supper soporific state so fatal in a darkened theatre space...
Definitely returning to do the whole BBQ thing.

780 Easily one of the top three Korean BBQ places I have eaten worldwide (except Korea). If you are in Edinburgh do your self a favor and stop in for an authentic,delicious Korean meal. The owner was incredibly friendly and even gave up one of her tables to let our group spread out. Made a great evening

782 BBQ'd meats were delicious (we had the squid and pork). Not rating this a 5 due to mediocre starters and lack of traditional banchan (all the small plates that typically come with a Korean meal). We were also asked if we wanted rice, which I found strange since that's expected with a traditional meal. Service was nice and expedient. Would still gladly return for the delicious flavor of the BBQ!

783 We went there because we already knew about the Korean Barbeque, and when we saw it walking around the area we thought to come and try it, and it was an amazing success.

We ordered a Seafood pancake, Chicken Gyoja, a Kimchi side (to try it since it is something typical from Korea) and the Mo Dum Gu I (Assorted meat bbq selection). Everything was really good. The seafood pancake was nothing special, but it was nice and tasty, more pancake flavour than seafood, but it was nice overall. The chicken gyoja were really nice, the Kimchi side is something you have to try at least once, and it was something spicy, crunchy, fresh and with a lot of flavour, even though is a side measure, it is quite a nice portion, so keep in mind if you just want to try it. And the best for us was the Mo Dum Gu (we got the Assorted meat bbq menu that includes salads), it comes with 2 sauces, one spicy and delicious and another of sesame that it was also really good, also comes with lettuce to make wraps (and when we ran out of lettuce they brought us more without charging for it), it also comes with some salads to fill your wraps or eat them alone, delicious, spicy and tasty. And the meat selection is top notch, everything was really nice but our favourites were the Pork neck slice and the Darkgalbi, both of them marinated. It includes also 2 beers or 2 soft drinks, but as we were ordering a bottle of wine, Pinot Grigio Veneto, we didn't ordered them. They brought to us some special radish to taste and include in the wraps for free, it was really good and it fits perfectly with the pork belly wraps.

Since it was rather late and we were quite full we decided not to order any dessert but we will do for sure the next time.

The waitress and the waiter were friendly, helpful and professional, they didn't step in too much in our table and we didn't have to wait for anything, they were really attentive and smiling.

Since we had a lot of food with sauces and we were eating slow, we got replaced our grills twice, but it was made with the best of the attitude and they were not intrusive or disturbing at all.

The experience was amazing, we will come back for sure and try other dishes and desserts.

As recommendation for the staff, you could put a sign on the corner of the street to make more noticeable your place, because you deserve all the possible attendance and success.

Cheers!

Natalia and Aingeru.

784 Our first experience of this style of cuisine and we enjoyed it. Bewildering range of choice, including a lot of options to cook your own on a special hotplate built in to the tables. As we had a limited time due to going to the theatre afterwards, we opted for dishes prepared in the kitchen.

787 A friend recommended this restaurant and we enjoyed a lovely meal together. I enjoyed the tasty food - from an excellent choice of dishes, but loved the intimate feel of this cosy restaurant. We went early on opening (5pm) and very soon after we could see how popular this place is with young couples. We didn't have courage to BBQ at table but what a lovely feature - I had only experienced this in Japan. I have planned to return - with more friends and look forward to my next meal.

791 I am from Korea(South) and I know the real taste of Korean dishes. Found this restaurant randomly and wanted to give it a go. I have noticed that most of Korean meals that you can try overseas can be a little bit different from its original taste.
I have tried a few Korean restaurants in Edinburgh and this place is actually good.
Ordered three dishes and all of them are really tasty. We(two of us) cleared all of them. Fine dishes! Loved it. I gave 4 stars for two reasons: 1. Parking can be a nightmare 2.Price is slightly higher than other restaurants. Am I going back? For sure!

If you want to experience, try this one or Sodaeng which is another good one to recommend. Good luck! ^___^

793 Have been there recently, went for a booked table. The Soju was amazing (plum)!!! We chose vegetarian and full fat sharing dish, and the spices were brilliant, but all together I missed some more meat. By taste there was nothing to complain about, maybe rather the portion or the mixture of the meat&veg. Definitely will go back, cause I am curious about the grill, what is built in the table in front of you

796 We had a very disappointing evening here. I have to follow a gluten-free diet and my friend stated in advance in her email booking that there would be two people who had to eat gluten free. The menu online also says that dietary requirements should be made clear to the waiters.

When we were ordering we asked the waiter which of the dishes could be made gluten free and which dishes should be avoided. The waiter did not know what gluten free meant and what wheat was when we tried to describe the dietary requirement. He made some suggestions from the banquet menu but could not confirm whether any of the sauces in the dishes contained gluten-ingredients which was very worrying.

We ended up having to order boiled rice and edamame means as we could not take the risk of having an allergic reaction. I would advise anyone with any dietary issues to avoid this restaurant as nobody seemed to follow through on the claim that they could accommodate dietary requirements.

798 It is so refreshing to do some grilling again.
THis is a good place for friends to sit down, chill and cook out.
The place is average, decor does not add a feel of being in an Asian food place.
Service is ok, they do help other customers who are new to table top grill experience.
The food is satisfying, especially since it's been a long time since we've had some grilled meat on the table. But I would say I've had better in the past. Also, there were only three side dishes. In authentic Korean restaurants, they provide about 5 or more with unlimited refills.

Nevertheless, if you miss the experience, this place provides some semblance to Korean grills in the UK

799 This place is hard to discover by chance but if you're lucky enough to walk past it you shouldn't hesitate to come in! We had quite a classic selection of pork belly and chilli marinated pork - both delicious - and on the side we tried a kimchi pancake. The meal comes with traditional vegetable sides/appetizers, too, which make you feel like you're really splurging on yourself even when your meal isn't that expensive!

We'll definitely be back.

800 Enjoyed the BBQ platter and most delightful seafood pancake for starter, but staff rushed to take the starter away. Meat was excellent, had to ask for extra lettuce and spring onion to eat it all and was charged extra for it, which I thought was unnecessary considering the cost. No atmosphere in the restaurant, so not rushing back.

801 I visited this new restaurant with my Korean born family for a celebration, after a recommendation. I was so pleased I chose here because everyone was very impressed with the food and the atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing. The interior has a contemporary design feel.
We went for the barbecue at your table option and cooked the meat ourselves which was good fun and made for an inclusive experience as we fought for control of the tongs and argued over who was to be chef.
We had the Sam Gyup Sal ( 3 layered pork) , Doe Ji Bulgogi( marinated pork) , So Bulgogi ( marinated beef), Saeng galbi (beef ribs) and Doenjang jjigae ( traditional stew). It was all excellent, particularly the meat I cooked ㅎㅎ. I would particularly recommend the Sam Gyup Sal which was a really flavoursome piece of meat.
Service was efficient and friendly and for me the bill was very reasonable.
I am looking forward to visiting again and trying some different dishes.

802 Been there twice since they've opened and, yes, the food is good (I'd give it 4 stars - points off because my kimchi soup was a bit bland..), but it was so frustrating how the dished appeared with LONG delays for different people...
The first time, it was just two of us, and it was relatively busy, so we thought it's not the end of the world that my boy-friend had already finished his meal before mine appeared (also: he hadn't noticed that he had to order rice with his meal and this also wasn't pointed out by the waiter... by the time we noticed this, the waiter was nowhere to be seen, so basically, my bf ate his main course..with some delay also his rice portion.. and then , finally did my course appear).

The same thing happened again the next time we came. We were 4 people then and there was only one other couple in the restaurant, but there was a ~10min lag between everyone's course being brought to the table. Very frustrating! (The fact that the waiter said "enjoy your meal" to the first person who got his food and then walked away, kind of implied that he'd better eat before it gets cold, I guess...)

It was generally very hard to get the waiter's attention , he even disappeared to the outside and never looked if we wanted more food/drinks etc.
By the end of the meal, we were sat for 30minutes chatting, but nobody came to actually remove the dirty plates and dishes from us.

I really hope that this place gets its service sorted, because it could be really good if it does...

806 A small restaurant, but the food is so good, and I like the decoration here. I like the BBQ here (especially the flavoured chicken) and the starters. Kimchi is authentic too. Sushi and rolls (I like the lion king roll) are ideal options beside the beef bibimbap!

807 Famous for its stir-fried chicken in spicy sauce (Dak Galbi), this restaurant is always very packed whenever we visit. Lucky for us, we are able to get a seat quickly this time.

We ordered the mix set which comes in 2 portion - spicy and non-spicy. The spiciness of the spicy version is just right and the non-spicy version is marinated in a sweet sauce. Both taste exceptionally good especially when mixed with the generous amount of cheese. Higly recommended and definitely a restaurant of a great value.

811 Terrible service! Rude waiter and waitress! When we had difficulty understanding what a particular waiter was trying to tell us in Korean, he kept repeating the same thing in Korean over and over again without making an attempt to seek help from his fellow colleague who could speak basic English. We were exasperated even before the start of a meal. We asked for the WIFI password and the waitress replied “NO WIFI” in a mono tone and gave us an expressionless look. Very unfriendly. To top it all, the food was not fabulous. Our 1st and last time there.

813 They prepare everything on a hot plate on the table but Koreans are used to spicy food so you come out smelling like spicy BBQ. I am sure that the food is not bad but after a while everything you taste is spicy, even the water. The second time we asked for non spicy and they still made it spicy. I think that everything is ready in the kitchen and they don't want to make special orders. Their self service water station has hot water but you have to boil it yourself.

814 Ate at this restaurant with my daughter, the kimchi rice was delicious , but of course very filling and way too much for only two people. There are many to choose from and the ingredients are cooked right in front of you. Make sure you come with a big appetite, a must try when in Seapul of craving for Kimchi roce. The place was packer and there a hige line. Prices are average.

815 We walked past this restaurant and were intrigued to see what the hype was because the restaurant was full.
We had to share the set meal so if you came with someone and you didn’t want to eat the food there you are screwed. So we had a set dinner for 4 people and chose the recommended dish with the kilo of cheese.
I have to say it’s very different. It was nice but very rich. I was stuffed. The food was ok.

816 Who can resist for mozarella?
This restaurant is very famous. If you go to Korea, you must it the chicken dakgalbi with mozarella. You can add ramen and topokki. Also you can add fried rice and mix with the leftover, then you get fried rice!
Taste really good and worth the price.

819 There are now a number of outlets of Yoogane in Myeongdong area but we decided to visit this one instead, finding it to be more spacious with more tables.

Staff speaks simple English and is very friendly and helpful. We ordered 1 non-spicy for the kids and 1 spicy for adults.

The non-spicy portion turned out to be a little salty but the kids loved it. The spicy portion was great and not too hot for Asian level of hotness. We concluded that the spicy one was better compared to the non-spicy one.

We found out that the side bar only after the meal, since the staff didn't explain it to us during order.

Overall we had a pleasant experience with the service and food offered.

823 The burner is built into each table and the server puts a pan on the hot plate and then stir fries the spicy chicken, vegetables and rice to create the dak galbi which is the signature dish. I just sat back and enjoyed my beer while watching my food being prepared right in front of me. The servers are moving quickly from table to table so it's rather impersonal service but I enjoyed it very much.

824 Not recommended for bug families as you will be forced to order the same item since there is only 1 hot plate per table of 4. You have choice to add side items. Meat is sufficiently marinated and tasted good. Interesting to see how the server prepared the food. What is good is you can help yourself to the salad and preserved radish. Surprising there was no kimchi. Costs per person average about 7000won

Went there twice during our trip (1st & last night) as we love the dakgalbi and personally I love the teppan fried rice (must add cheese!!)!!! They will come around to help with the meat tossing occasionally or you can cook it by yourself. Free flow of sides like kimchi & other pickles.

834 Satisfying meal good enough for everyone. We ordered the basic set chicken barbecue with fried rice for four (extra cheese) and extra noodle (for my wife who doesn’t want it that spicy). We were attended to immediately and the staff were going around to see to it that they would cook the food in front of you every time they would pass your table until it is done and ready to eat. I found the taste very nice and it does go well with their Korean cider (which actually is their local Sprite). Dinner turned out fine even if I did have some hesitation before we entered the place.

Marinated chicken and octopus stir fried with cabbage, green onions. Easy to order and just add on noodles ,cheese or rice. The meal will be cooked at your table where you can enjoy the sizzling sound , see that fancy red and finally enjoy the full taste.

But the only restrictions is meal must be ordered in the exact number of people s Portion so

839 This place is fking crap. The staff here is ridiculous. When first arriving, the cashier at the front failed to acknowledge us. We then had to sit ourselves down and nobody even came to serve us for an entire 15 minutes. When staff finally came to us after 15 minutes,they provided us with a menu and only 10 seconds later, asked what we wanted. When we asked for a minute to decide,the waitress rolled her eyes and sighed heavily. Later, a foreign family of four ladies came and experienced the same treatment. Their response was to leave the restaurant which I now wished we did. The food here was mediocre at best and our only wish was to get up and leave as soon as possible. Do yourself a favor and do not enter this establishment. If you like rude customer service, then this place is perfect for you!

841 Me and my friends only tried the chicken fried rice but it was SO GOOD! In fact it was so good that we came back 5+ times for more on our trip to Korea. Last time we ate there we asked less spice and that was a mistake, since the spiciness really added to the taste of the food. Once one of the employee finished frying the rice he shaped it as a heart. Was super cute! Was very cheap too so it didn't kill our wallet :)

842 First of all we didn’t even get to eat at their restaurant, thank god. I came in to their restaurant during lunch and ask this person at the casher if they can cater for 16 people and he said no. Then i ask if he can prepare a table for 4, since my son is craving for fried ramen, what happen next was he went straight to the door and ask me to leave. Then i ask him nicely how long do i have to wait? He said go and don’t wait with a rude voice witout looking at my face and there was no explanation even a simple appology. This restaurant is the worst i have ever encounter in terms of their service with their customer. The rudest restaurant in Seoul. I don’t recommend anyone to come to this place. It will definitely spoiled your trip.

844 a bad idea to take your family to eat at this place, I went into this restaurant with 3 members of my family, the staff treated us very badly, we ordered 4 different servings of food, but they forced us to order the same menu !!
Price is not a problem for us even though this restaurant has an average price of over 14,000 won but the appetite is something that is very privacy for us, the stupidest decision I made when traveling to South Korea was to go to this restaurant. this is serious ... don't be tempted by the crowds of people you see from outside the restaurant, stay away from this restaurant from your visit to the itinery.

845 My wife and I were at this restaurant around 3 in the afternoon. Was seated by staff waving in a general direction so we found some seats and sat down to look at the menu. After being over looked for close to 20 minutes even as we watched 3 other tables that arrived after us get served we decided to leave. We never got to eat but the sense we had was that we were being ignored on purpose because waiters were serving the tables immediately around us. So for service and attitude I strongly recommend people to not eat here. There are too many good restaurants around that deserve our business before this one.

849 This was one of the highly recommended food in many blog, but after trying various other types of Korean food, this one pale compared in terms of authenticity and taste to me. If you run out of ideals and this is near by, can consider for eat-to-live.

What I didn’t like about such restaurant is that you have to order the same kind of food for 2 persons because they cannot fry different meal/flavor on the same hot top.

And suddenly come other staff that look like it is the manager and he yell to us that we cannot sit there because there is 2 stove in the table, and move as rudely to table that have one stove in the back. And it is continue when we want to choose the menu, that staff tell we must have same menu because the stove is just one and menu cannot be mixed eventhough we wanted to have different menu and we forbidden to move back to that table. So, we comprise and got same menu because we already hungry. Later on, when we paid the bill that rude staff is in the cashier and give the change without saying anything. The other staff is still friendly and said thank you but look like afraid of that person. I will never come this place again, and recommended you to choose other branch in the end of this street if you want tasted this good food.

851 The food is okay, but the owner is rude and disrespectful, the three of us came to that place the staff allow me to choose the table, and we choose the table with 4 desk near the wall, then the owner came and yell "no no three persons here!! here no no no!!!" he told us to move to the table at the back near kitchen. After we paid the owner not even say a single word and thank you (the other sajangnim we met in Korea always say thank you and polite, except this owner). I will never come to this place again

852 We had brunch in this restaurant. We were 7 so we were broken into 2 tables. The waiter informed us that those seated in 1 table were required to have the same order. So, 4 of us wanted spicy food so they sat together and had to order 4 servings of the Spicy Chicken Rice. The other 3 who were not into spicy food had to order 3 servings of the Chicken Bulgogi (which was sweet but also slightly spicy) and separate orders of rice. I really enjoyed the Chicken Bulgogi and even the people in the spicy table liked it. The rice was sticky and delicious too. After eating, we had to go to the cashier at the entrance and pay the bill.

853 When I want to eat spicy Stir-fried Chicken, I usually went Yoogane. Yoogane has many kinds of menu and we can choose that we want to eat. When I went to Yoogane, I almost eat Yoogane’s spicy Stir-fried Chicken. It was my best menu in Yoogane. Sometimes, I add noodles and cheese. I think cheese is the best combination with spicy Stir-fried Chicken. Lastly, when I am done eating, we can add fried rice. I think this steps are best step for eating spicy Stir-fried Chicken. Therefore, if you have some chance for try it, you can order this menu. In addition, price is not really expensive.

855 Me and my friend went to yoogane in Myeongdong. We ordered dakgalbi with additional ramen and cheese. The staff can speak english very well so there is no problem for tourist if we cant speak korean. They provide free water so we dont need to order drink. The best dakgalbi so far!!! will come back again when I visit seoul!

856 I guess I am not the only one experience the bad customer service...
Came here during lunch time but not peak hour yet. We wanted to order one set of the chicken galbi but the staff is so rude saying ' i said, this is for one person portion'. I asked politely whether we can share (just in case it was too spicy for us) & he repeat 'I said' more loudly. His face turn so sour & walk away. We have no choice but to order 2 person portion (6500 won times 2!). Turns out so spicy & made our stomach discomfort ....Couldn't even finish 1/4 portion of it. Chicken meat is so little in the set.
I would suggest to skip this rude & arrogant restaurant!

857 i am not really a typical customer who will write a bad comment. i was really excited to eat here because this is my first time and i came with my friend. but i am very very disappointed with yoogane chicken in myeongdong services especially staff name chang dong na services she has the bob cut hair.

first, staff came to our table asking for the order. she is not very nice from the beginning but i still think maybe she’s busy and in a rush. after we order she’s just take the food in the table and leave. considering me and my friend are first timer eating here we don’t know how to cook the food. and she just leave without saying a word. we assume that we have to cook the food by ourself. and after we trying to put all the food together and cook. she’s just running into our table and say it in korean language with rude tone voice and she throwing out the food from the cooking pan with very very unappropriate way. and she just start talking to the other staff. luckily my friend a lil bit korean language and she just tell me what she said in korea “if i was them, i will not eat the food”

i probably not recommended this restaurant. please treat the customer nicely even when you are busy just do the job proffesionally.

859 I don't normally write reviews but this restaurant was so bad that I was compelled to write one.

This was our first meal in korea and didnt know what we're in for, staff pointed to our table we were given menus, we called the waiter to order when she arrived, she was too busy fixing her makeup and hair on the mirror wall (just wasn't interested).

Asked her if the food was spicy (we were eating with young kids) she said no, when food came it was spicy.

She just gave us a disgusted look, went away happily spoke to other staff came back again with another disgusted look.

The supposedly personally chef was meant to cook our food.

We waiting too long and started to cook our own food.

Couldnt understand why we were treated in this manner we were a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 kids spoke nicely to them.

Tried other restaurants for the next 7days food was better and services at other places was outstanding.

Later on I realised a lot of other people that came here were treated the same way, believe it, its true.

Don't waste your money here!!!!

Pros: OK food

Cons: Worst restaurant staff I have came across in my last 10 years of travel.

860 Yoogane is located in the heart of Myeongdong. Price is standard in Seoul and portion is for 2-4 persons. The specialty of this restaurant is dakgalbi which is chicken and cooked with rice . Our children liked it so much. Side dish is also simple with kimchi as main side dish.

861 The food is good but the service was bad. Probably I was speaking in Chinese with my kids, and the waitress gave a face.

And when a Japanese family walked in, The waitress was giving the best smile n greeting the other family.

This made me wonder why there is a diff in service.

Hence I will not be eating in such restaurant again.

862 I came to Seoul without knowing about K-Pop, K-Drama, or even Korean Food, We didn't quite have the motivation to try out restaurants since me and my friend doen't really enjoy Korean food, but this restaurant changed our opinion. The spice doesn't feel tasteless like the other dakgalbi I tasted in my country , we finished the whole wok just the 2 of us.

863 We tried the Chicken Galbi and it was really an excellent experience. Basically they get raw marinated chicken with optional veggies, bulgogi or seafood and cook it on a large pan on your table. Everyone on the table needs to have the same dish as its communal eating and they bill you per head.

866 Wanted some spicy Korean dakgalbi while hanging out in Myeongdong and all everything seems to be pointing towards YOOGANE.
Pressto this shop has very delicious and spicy chicken and octopus galbi.
Super texture and wrap it up with side dish of fried rice which soaks up all the goodness from the galbi. The shop has rotating team that comes every 3 mins to stir fry your plate which means you get 3-4 different person frying your galbi. Get your own unlimited kimchi and salad bar at the corner and the kimchi is GOOD.
Went there again as was hooked to the GALBI.

867 We had Yoongane twice during our visit. Once for lunch and another time for dinner. Tried the spicy chicken with cheese the first time . It was really delicious but we found it a little too spicy after the cheese ran out. The second time, we had the honey chicken which tasted great. Only downside was that we could not order any extra sides after a certain timing. So we couldn’t add any ramen or stuff. But we were thankful that they were still open as most of then restaurants were already closed. They are open till 1am.

868 This is a great place to have dakgalbi, a spicy chicken and rice stir fry. This dish is a must have for Seoul, South Korean tourists! Usually this dish is very spicy,but thankfully this place is used to tourists, so they don’t make it as spicy here.

The decor here is pretty nice and clean, more like a modern Western restaurant standard/feel. The tables have a kind of stove and when we ordered the dish, they brought a massive pot. They cooked the meat and rice for you, though you can do some of it yourself. That’s one of the beauties of eating like this, the active participation and freshness of the food you get to eat.

This dish is really tasty! There’s vegetables as well and it is saucy with a spicy, sweet, and savoury flavour. It’s difficult to a solo diner here because the portion is massive and I don’t know if they have “to go”.

It was about 20,000 Won.The price is moderate, compared to other cheaper places, but still reasonable and delicious. The service is very fast and efficient. I would definitely go here to have this dish again!

869 There are many of these chain restaurants in Seoul. The establishment is always busy because it has a fast service with reliable taste and affordable price. If you want to get traditional Chicken Galbi (유가네 닭갈비) in a local small friendly place with tasty side dishes and wanting to blend in to the local crowd, you would love this place. If you higher expectations there are better places that serve the same food for a higher price.
I would recommend it.

871 This restaurant is always busy whenever we pass by. We went to Myeongdong 3 consecutive days and we were amazed how they get lots of customers. The first time we tried around 11pm, we were told that they were closed already so we went back the ff day for lunch. Had a good chicken and seafood dish with cheese though they can still improve on their side dishes. Wait staff always check our food and they did it alternately very often.

872 Went in this place after saw lot of people in there. Staff don’t have patient to answer our question and been rude (I know they’re busy but this is not the way to handle foreign customer). Some dishes cannot be share if you have more people (in my case 5 person) and forced us to pick some dishes that charged us per pax. Staff only came once in a while to stir the raw meat, and we had to do it our own before they came to our table.

874 One of a must eat place in Seoul, Korean loves chicken and cheese ! put it together and you would get spicy chicken fried rice with added mozzarella cheese. The food is cooked right in front of you (and for you), and it is very tasty. The spiciness is just right and it is a delicious meal that can be shared by the table!

Pro tip: the minimum order is two people portion and they open till 2am, perfect for a mid night snack!

875 Highly recommended for first timers in Myeongdong. Before you jump in your night shopping exercises, make sure to load some calories at this resto. There's six of us and we ordered different dishes from their menu. My, everything we ordered is worth every won we paid. Side dishes are refillable too! Serving sizes are for sharing so if you're in a group you can budget between KRW10,000-15,000 each for a hearty meal. =)

876 Our first dakgalbi and we were not disappointed. It had the right amount of spice and the marinated chicken and octopus were yummy. We ordered fried rice and it was added in together with the chicken and octopus. Would have loved to add the cheese but I think it would have been too filling.

Best to eat with more people. I went with my 71 year old mom so we wanted to order just for one to share but that wasn’t allowed. In the end we almost managed to finish our food.

You could get as much from the salad bar.

If you can’t tolerate spice you might not enjoy this. Be warned though, after your food, your hair and clothes will smell of bbq.

877 I'm not really sure if this is the 1st store, there's a few Yoogane in Myeongdong but this store is rather big.

We have 2 persons and ordered marinated
chicken galbi & assorted seafood with 1 fried rice. Should have ordered 2 fried rice.

At first, we don't know how to ordered, we were lucky that the young girl who served us could speak English and also she recommended us to take this marinated chicken galbi & assorted seafood because this serve 2-3 pax, other sets serve 1 pax and we have to order 2 servings.

The portion was not very huge, we can finished them. The marinated chicken was quite tasty, not greasy and very flavorful.

The staff look busy, those who cannot communicate with us, simply ignore us when we call for them.

878 I saw the restaurant had a big one step to get in, but inside it was pretty accessible. I was pushing my husband’s wheelchair in when the greeter didn’t let us in at all. He said we could not go in because it was too narrow. I went inside and I could see there was plenty of room to move around compared to most of the restaurants around Myeongdong. He said sorry, but didn’t let us in even tough there was room.

879 Not sure if this is the correct branch as there are many branches in Myeondong. Anyway, the food served are the same. Highly recommend tourists to have this in South Korea as it is really very cheap. My friend and I ordered a 2-pax portion for our dinner. When it came, we were shock as it was huge! The staff were very attentive and keep coming over to help us fry the chicken and making sure it's cooked before removing the metal ring fenced around the hotpot and shutting down the flame. It was very spicy but very yummy! The cheapest meal we had in South Korea for our whole trip. The meal only cost us around USD11! Super worth it, so its a 'MUST EAT' in South Korea as the same portion cost about USD20-30 back in our home country.

Very recommended.

882 Chicken galbi with mozzarella cheese is great. Staff can't speak much English and that maybe a factor people think they are rude. But they're not. They try their best. Good food but really spicy. It's around $12 per person, which is well worth it.

883 We got to our hotel late and wanted to try some street food on the way to dinner and Yoogane was on our restaurant list. It’s a casual restaurant with lots of young, local customers. There were 3 of us and we wanted to try multiple galbi options. He suggested just one order for 2 as it was a lot of food and should be able to serve 3 adults. We didn’t listen, but at least he tried to stop us. We ordered the spicy galbi with cheese for 2. The meat, dipped and curled around the melted cheese was divine. We next ordered the mixed honey and marinated galbi with a cheese river separating the two meats. Again very good. You may need to double check that the meat is cooked through as a few pieces needed to be cooked a bit longer. It wasn’t a problem as you just moved it to the side to cook longer. They have a little self service bar where you can pick up your own kimchee, soybean soup...The 3 of us nearly finished the 2 complete orders. If we had more time, we would have gone back for another meal.

884 My friend and I loved Yoogane! We were the only non-Koreans in the restaurant when we dined in, but have no worries - the staff dealt with us well even though they all said their English wasn't very good. The menu is in Korean and English (and pointing works well too).

Be warned that portions are large so come hungry and make sure you take advantage of the side bar to get your kimchi fix in for free.

886 The cheese is pretty good. It is one of the best korean food i have ever tried. After your stomach is full, you can start your shopping journey there.
887 Frankly I have not experienced shops can beat this in terms of service. Shopkeeper insisted we had to order one portion per person even though we told them we definitely could not finish and it would be a waste of food. Walked out as the attitude of the waiter was SO bad that we rather go somewhere else that shows even a tiny bit of respect to food.

889 Two adults and two kids. Kids were not hungry so we wanted to just order food for 2 adults. But server said no. 4 seats. You must order minimum 3 orders. What a shame. We walked out. There are many other restaurants with a same menu nearby. Terrible attitude.
890 Firstly, the staff was very gracious and accommodating.:) They helped us with the menu because we weren't aware of the level of spiciness.

There was a salad bar where you can get the vegetables and kimchi. :)

The meat is as tender and as well-marinated. The level of spiciness is less than moderate, and it is more sweet than spicy actually. It was complemented by the vegetables and kimchi.
The chicken may be the main dish, but we also tried the seafood which was equally amazing and tasty.

Overall, I enjoyed Yoogane because of it's value for money, great dining experience, and the food of course. We came back regularly during our stay in Korea. :)

891 After shopping and walking around myeongdong, you must visit this restaurant located in Myeongdong to feed your belly. You can choose chicken, beef or seafood for the main dish and you can also can choose rice or noodle if you wanna. For addition you can choose vegetable, cheese and another topping to mix it together. The boy from this restaurant will help you too cook with the pan located in you table. Their cooking skill will be a good show that you must see it.

893 The name Yoogane is very famous for Dakgalbi. Other branches in Myeongdong are are OK. But this branch is terrible. The staffs who are taking care of the queue are not quite friendly. When we got the seats and started to order, they were not polite at all. We would like to order for the quantity that we could finish. (We also had a small child with us.) But they did not allow us to do so. They did not care that we had a small kid. More over, we came in 5 people, but they separated one of us to sit with the strangers in the table beside the rest 4. So .. NO MORE for this branch.
894 We had Yoogane chicken galbi at a different branch the night before. Like it so much that we decided on lunch at a separate branch. This shop is much bigger, easier to find but service and food are not as good as previous night's. While browsing the menu, the waiter refused to take our order for beers. We chosen Yoogane marinated chicken galbi today but the cooking was too fast and the vegetables are very much half-cooked. This is one branch of Yoogane that I will avoid.

895 We ordered seafood fried rice with rice cakes. The taste was a bit bland - maybe its because we Malaysians like flavourfull food...i dont know... you have to get the sides (which is the kimchi and the cabbage salad) by your own at the counter. The waiter was...okay...not friendly but not rude either.

896 We came for dinner on New Year's Eve - around 6 pm. Easily found a table. We ordered 2 of the chicken fried rice. I didn't want anything spicy and this wasn't. Each person has to order 1 order so we ordered 2 orders of this for 6,000 won each.

Someone cooks the food for you and you can get some pickles, kimchi and salad yourself.

The staff isn't overly friendly but for the price, we didn't expect too much. Food was hot and good. It's more like korean fast food.

898 Our Nami Tour started and ended at Myeondong. We went there early to make sure we make on time. During our ocular at Myeondong, we saw this galbi restaurant called Yoogane, so after the tour we headed to this galbi place. It was not surprising that their galbi was really good because the restaurant was full. We ordered half half galbi meaning half classic and half spicy chicken galbi. Their side dishes are self service.

They don't serve pork but then their chickens are non halal...the service was also bad. No one guide us to our table when we approached the counter. We sat there for almost 15 min before someone approached us & asked us the order. We asked the waiter whether the place is a halal friendly & they said NO so we left the place immediately. So, my advise to all our Muslim colleagues, stay away from the restaurant!

901 My parents, fiance and myself had been looking forward to dine at this restaurant. We headed there a little later in the afternoon to miss the lunch crowd. When we got there, there was no queue and a bunch of tables available. GREAT!!! .

The ladies headed over to the restroom but there was a queue. My dad and myself had a seat and looked through the menu. We decided on what we wanted to eat and my mum got back and started looking through the menu.

Here is when our mood was totally killed. My lady wasn't even back yet, and its been no more than 5 minutes. This guy, whom i assume is the Supervisor, cause he was in a different uniform, came up to our table aggressively and raised his voice saying, 'Order NOW, YOU SIT HERE SO LONG'. I explained, my wife is in the toilet, dont worry once shes out we will order'. He shouts, 'NO ORDER NOW' and flings the menu at my 64 year old dad.

Things have clearly already gone out of hand. I tell my parents to pack and i stood up and told him to back off. I was FUMING. This went way too far. If my parents and lady were not there, this would have gone alot worse.

We stood up and left. I am disgusted by this establishment, and would NEVER recommend stepping foot in this horrendous place. Picture of the 'Supervisor' included.

902 Interested to try yoogane after seeing the way they cook the food on our table. But all are chicken menu, and the problem is if we are on the same table, we have to choice 1 menu, maybe because they cook on our table. If you are 3 or 4 people. Then you have to choose one. As a traveler we prefer to try several different foods instead of one choice. Taste is not bad, maybe chicken is not my favorite.

903 On our second day in Seoul we tried Chicken Galbi Yoogne in MyeongDong shopping town.
The restaurant that claim themselves as Korea's number One chicken Galbi has been in the business since 1981. A narrow entrance and staircase brought us to the second floor of the shop. We waited around 15-20 min at the staircase as they only have around 15-20 tables and no waiting room.

We ordered Marinated Chicken Galbi Fried Rice and the Marinated Chicken Galbi by itself with the addition of extra noodles, rice and cheese. They are cooked in front of us and everyone was given an apron to prevent any spraying from the cooking. Main ingredients were chicken, cabbage, oil and chili . Chili empowering the whole dish, so for some people, the dish might be too strong and spicy but it is very delicious.
Kimchi and other pickles were self served and they are fresh.
For me personally, one experience of eating here is enough.
Room is spacious,well lighted and clean but one bad thing was that the toilet is outside the dining room and is not very clean and is stinky.

905 As we saw a lot of local people queuing for this restaurant, we decided to go as well. You sit at an table with a stove, where the attentive and english speaking staff will cook your spicy chicken or seafood. For two people, I recommend to get the "small/middle" size and to add some rice/tteobokki/ramen. Add some extra cheese to combat the spiciness. Also ask for an apron, as the red oil may spatter onto your clothes.

We really enjoyed this franchise and went again at another location.

907 we came here for lunch before our flight back home, the restaurant was packed with locals and tourist alike. As you can guess, all the offerings revolved around Chicken.

Food is nice, especially with the sauce but for two persons, the taste gets "heavy" midway through.

the staff are attentive and efficient, a smile would be nice though.

pricing is not expensive and it is value for money

the only negative is the food smell, make sure you dont bring your favourite heavy coats, or go there during your last day so that the smell that lingers doesnt irk you too much.

915 Yoogane was discussed in several blogs so I tried to give it a go. Personally, it was very smokey inside. My eyes can't handle any smoke, so I was eating with red eye and crying for the whole lunch because of it.
The food itself not bad. The cheese and noodle toppings will enhance your appetite.
The service was quite rude. This is what I actually experience in some places in korean. They tend to ignore you when they can't speak english. But hey, this is a restaurant and I'm sorry, I can't tolerate if you leave me when I am speaking and giving my food order to you, especially when you do it because you want to serve other table. My friends in fact need to calm me down so that I won't leave right in the middle of our lunch.

Perhaps I was too hungry so I easily got mad, but hate the service and that uncomfortable smokey place did not help. Will not come again, especially when the taste did not make up for the bad experience.

Tables are one of the smallest compared other restarants, seats are very packed, legs would hit the table legs if two sit
together on the same side.
Good for someone who like to eat rice. The problem is that the order is counted by the numbers of persons. One and only one dish ordered- big wak rice.
The one we ordered is rice with cheese, pretty alright and cheap, about $6000 won a person.
Free vege, raw cabbage and cold
soup can eat all you can- i did not bordered.

919 Great experience and great meal. It was tasty and spicy. if you don't like much spicy just order steamed rice so you get a bowl of rice, don't order as fried rice cause they will put the rice in dakgalbi.

920 HORRIBLE SERVICE. I came with two of my siblings and order a table for 9 people (the others were on the way). For some reason they told us to come to them when everyone present and command us to wait outside. That was very rude since clearly there was a bench beside us to wait for the table, and they shove us away like we were beggars. The cashier was especially rude, he was the one who shove us away. Whatever you do fellow tourists, DO NOT GO TO YOOGANE NEAR MYEONGDONG KYOJA. thats all thank you

921 Nothing positive to say about Yoogane. Concept of mixed rice cooked in front of you is great. However, the rice had no flavor despite the heavy colors. It was dry and there was barely any cheese or chicken in the end product. I can't rave enough about the food Seoul has to offer but best avoid this one.

923 The dish was very flavorful. After few rounds of it we felt quite yucky. Mayb becoz we didn't order the instant noodle or rice or cheese to mix together that's y the sauce was too rich in taste.

924 Was at Myeondong area with my family of four (2A/2C) shopping for hours that we accidentally bumped into this Chicken Galbi restaurant. The food (we ordered chicken + octopus + fried noodles) is simply delicious and would be easy to accept/eat, especially for foreigners who are exposed to Korean food for the 1st time. Price wise it is not too expensive, but would have to agree with many others that there is certainly room for improvement on their service level from the staff. But for the price one is paying and considering this is a so-called Korean Galbi chain, we are not too bothered with the so called poor level of service.

925 I just visited this restaurant at Myeong Dong. And I received terrible service, I strongly advice you to not petrol this restaurant ( Yoogane ) if you are unable to communicate in Korean. I ordered chicken galbi fried rice but they gave me seafood as well based on assumption. I am allergy to seafood hence I told them "no seafood only chicken" then the manager gave me a frustrated and impatient look. They claim that they provide the best service to the their customers but I guess not. So far we have no other issues with other restaurants we've visited in Korea.

926 I tried this restaurant afew days ago for dinner with my family. The food was not very fantastic, the staff speaks little english and mandarin. They charge by head count.
The manager was not very polite and he keeps coming to our table for order while we are still discussing what to order. He got no patient to explain how the price was charge untill the next table customer explained to us.
After we ordered the food, they will cook the food for us. Self service of the side dish, only pickle radish and cabbage. Overall taste of the food is nothing fantastic, stress manager, overall dining feeling is below average.

927 We visited at 11am for lunch on a weekday and we were seated right away. Waiter spoke some English, we ordered 2 of their "best" galbi dish without cheese ( we had to do 2 orders as per the waiter, we couldn't just order 1). It was very good, and cooked well by staff. I would recommend trying their food.

928 This restaurant is located in the centre of Myeong-Dong. In the evening the restaurant is crowded. The staff holds is not to say that unfriendly, rather in the distance. This can be understood, the number of visitors is very much. The main "trick" for tourists - the food is prepared in front of you. For Koreans it is quite trivial. "Prepared" is probably a strong word. Rather mixed and heated. This allows you to feel involved in the process. The food itself is ordinary, nothing supernatural. I'd define as Korean fastfood. So the prices are quite humane.

929 Very crowded restaurant. Staff was not so friendly. After ordering food and drink they soon come and prepare the food in a pan which is in front of you. For me the food was so so and the portion is quite small.

930 I'm unsure whether it was just at the time of our visit that the food tasted poor, or if it's all the time really bad. I ordered the Seafood gal bi / fried rice with cheese, and my rice was very dry. The seafood was overcooked until it shrunk into tiny proportions and I could not tell if it was a squid or prawn or shellfish that I was eating. The food really tasted so so.

However, there's a self serve station for kimchi, soup and shredded cabbage for you to help yourself with. The waitress frying up our food took her time serving others as well hence the very dry fried rice. I didn't know if we're allowed to fry the food ourselves, but when i tried to touch the frying spatula, the waitress hissed at me. I don't know if it's just me or they just don't like tourists. The price however is pretty much cheap compared to other type of restaurants.

933 I noticed with other reviews that getting a table for one could be a problem, but luckily for me it wasn't

The best is to compare this to any fast food restaurant. Don't expect a great service or a fine dining experience. But the food is good, fast and cheap!

After ordering your food and drink they soon come and prepare the food in a pan which is in front of you. When the food is done it's time to enjoy! The food itself has a great flavour and the portion is sufficient. If you are a big eater you might want to order a side dish.
If you need something you press the button and otherwise you go to the cashier to pay and leave.

A great place for a quick bite if you prefer to spent your time on other things in Seoul!

934 I always go to Yoogane at least once whenever I visit Myeongdong. The food and rice are okay. It's a pretty busy place, and always full of people, so I suggest going here at around 11am to be make sure you are seated at once.

937 We came across Yoogane a few times walking up and down the market area and decided to google it back at the hotel before visiting since we saw a lot of people queuing to go in, not realising that it was one of the must try places.
Please note that if you're looking for top service then this may not be the correct place for you. It's an establishment to enjoy the atmosphere of the galbi being cooked in front of you.
We waited for about 10/15 minutes and eventually got seated, table still being half cleaned as we sat down. Had a more older waitress waiting us, she tried her best to explain to us how it worked but communication barrier broke down a bit and not to her fault. We chose the standard chicken galbi and ordered additional rice to go with it.
Everything arrived pretty quick and was soon on the fire cooking, the service staff must rotate in the tables since we didn't really see the original waitress again. You're able to stir the ingredients yourself or the staff will come around periodically doing it. Either way, it can be fun so enjoy it.
Once cooked we were asked if we wanted the rice added in as well. Note, the rice is supposed to be added after you've eaten some of it and not added in straight when the cheese, chicken and veg is cooked. The new waiter that's come to our table asked if we wanted, but didn't advise that it should be done after. Only knowing after it was added, its meant to be cooked with the left overs to soak up the remaining flavours on the palate.

Overall a decent visit but a smelly one, was nice but would go back to eat it properly next time. Be prepared for your clothes to smell after so wear something that you're prepared to go without for the remaining trip.

938 Went there in a group of 5 adults and 2 children, they couldn't accommodate all of us on one table, we were split to 2 tables. They will insist each adult to have a serving even if one person said she is not hungry and won't be eating. Waitress arrived with cooking tray and was just banging everything. She had a grumpy face the whole time when she was cooking our food. Never mention to us to self serve our own side dishes, lucky we saw ourselves. Food was nothing special, the chicken galbi with vegetables had lots of cabbage and spring onions. The noodles were a bit burnt. Will not recommend this place, look for another chicken galbi place if you want to eat this food.

939 This is one of the famous and always crowded touristy restaurants in Myeong-dong area. Good one to try different Galbi dishes. Done limitations exist like all in the table should order the same type of Galbi as there is only one pan per table.

Anyways a decent place to try Galbi in the famous shopping area of Myeong-dong.

940 My friend and i had chicken galbi fried rice with bean sprouts and cheese. Serving is good but with very few chicken on it. So more of a rice with the hot paste and the bean sprouts. The staff would cook it in front of you but the cheese is a bit burnt because they put it at the bottom.

There's a small counter for side dishes at the center - radish and cabbage. The staff won't mention it to you though so you just have to be observant!!

Will probably try just the chicken galbi next time..

941 Tourist trap. Rude staff, they just want you to eat and get out of their way. Food is just ok, no big deal. Very smoky, your clothes and hair will come out smelling like BBQ for days. And the smell of chilli is so strong that I couldn't stop coughing because of it.

943 We heard that this would be a good place to eat because of the food but we sorely regretted coming here because of the horrible service. After we sat down, our waitress was rude and had attitude with us, likely because she did not speak much English. She even gave us looks while we were ordering because she had a difficult time understanding. Because she had a difficult time understanding, she placed the wrong order without even checking with us and then telling us that we can't change it because it has already been placed. After that, she did not try to check in with us and another server had to help us with the food. We never saw the waitress again during our meal. The table next to us were also tourists and we could tell they had some confusion with what they ordered and their waiter was impatient with them and rudely asked a server to deal with them. I would think because this location is in a tourist district that they would cater to tourists but they really fail with that. It seems to be always busy despite the poor service, probably because of its prime location. Will not be visiting again or recommending it to others. The food was okay despite not what we wanted to order.

944 My friend who was visiting from Bangkok wanted to try something different so we decided to dine here after a long day of shopping. Honestly, I am not a fan of Dakgalbi so I probably would have never ate here if it wasn't for my friend. The waiter wasn't friendly (or rude) but we were able to order our food and got what we needed. We went after the lunch rush but there were still a lot of diners and it was busy. Our food came shortly and we chatted while waiting for the chicken to be cooked all the way. I thought the food was just average and wasn't spicy enough but my friend who never had Dakgalbi before loved it. We loved dipping our chicken in cheese and the fried rice they made for us at the end. I'm glad my friend enjoyed her meal but I probably won't visit on my own.

945 Never have I ever placed a 1 star review on Tripadvisor, nor walked out of a resturaunt so confused and angry.

Me and my partner went to this restaurant as our first BBQ experience. Small menu, so we tried to order a BBQ chicken dish for 2 people (23000 won) as well as another chicken rice dish (6000 won) as we were so hungry. Was told we could not order both dishes? We didnt understand why this was, so tried to clarify - and our waiter was so rude, treating us like we were stupid. We continually tried saying we wanted both, and was not given a clear explanation as to why we had to choose one or the other. Why is it that your resturaunt would not allow us to spend the extra money for one extra dish?

Also found it odd the treatment of other customers wanting to come in to the restaurant by the man at the front - not even a smile on his face, very abrupt.

Lack of service standards are clearly reflected in many reviews as we found out after exiting the resturaunt and searching it up online.

We ended up walking out without ordering anything, and found a better resturaunt with MUCH better service.

946 First off, if you are visiting Korea, chicken BBQ (galbi) is one of the must food you must try! So, there's hundreds of restaurants you can go to. So, I would say Yoogane is pretty popular with tourists and locals. It's a chain but they are consistent and good. It's spicy but you can order non-spicy for children or those who don't want spicy.

Like everyone says, they cook the food in front of you so, it does get smelly (but so does every local BBQ joints in Korea). So, cover your jackets with their aprons they provide or put it in a shopping bag if you have them. This helps reduce the after effects :). They have frebreez-type spray by the exit if you can't live with the smell.

I would say it's almost a three course meal. First, your chicken BBQ. You can add whatever you want to make it more customized to your tasting such as cheese, udon noodles, etc. Second course, you order the fried rice, which they take your leftover chicken BBQ and its sauces and mix white rice and other little ingredients. After you get your filling of rice, then you order your third entree, which is Naeg-Mun (cold water noodle). It's has some sweet and vinegar taste. It's a nice way to refresh after the hot and spicy food.

It's nothing fancy but it's a nice way to get some culture and local food. The hard part is finding this place. It's tucked away with all other shops.

947 Found this restaurant just off the main Myeondong shopping street. Its on the inner lane just opposite Olive Young.

Price wise reasonable and the food was good. If you love it spicy, can get them to add more chilli paste. Very tasty and you can either add rice or noodles wt your galbi. Highly recommended and usually quite crowded during dinner time.

948 My daughter has always been a big fan of Yoogane so we squeezed time to find the store in Myeongdong. Luckily, when we got there, there was no line but we need to wait for a couple of minutes to have our table prepared since we are 5 in all. Their tables are designed for 4 only. Service was fast but since the place is too crowded, the place is really quite tight and small. By the time we were eating the number of people queuing outside has started to grow..

The service crew are always busy going from one table to another table, so expect that 3 to 4 crew will be checking your food being cooked.

950 Yoogane is available in many places & so does in Myeong Dong shopping area. They sell fried rice but you can have add-on such as udon (do add on udon!). They have chicken fried rice or seafood. For Muslims, go for the seafood. By the way, the food will be prepared right in front of your eyes!

955 We stopped for dinner in this popular restaurant for dinner. It's one of a chain of restaurants where they cook at your table. We choose their signature dish of chicken and cabbage mixed with red sauce and rice which was good. Our waiter brought the ingredients and cooked them. At first we thought it was because we were foreigners, but then we noticed that other waiters were doing the same at other customers' table. Be prepared to wait in line for some time if you arrive at "rush" hour. There is a food station where one can get some appetizers and sauces. Bathroom is downstairs.

958 Another halal restaurant to try while in Seoul. They count the price by head, so if you come as 2 people ordering menu with price of 10k won, the final price would be 20k won. We ordered octopus+chicken with white rice. They cook the food for you, so hold your droll. Affordable price for a tasty food.

959 There are 2 stores just in Myeongdong. Went to both of them. The store which is on the 1st level was a lot more crowded. Their dakgalbi was drier compared to the other store which was on the 2nd level. Taste wise was the same. Pretty good food and staff were kind and not rude. There were complimentary sides of kimchi, lettuce and etc. A good tip is to let the staff cook and just wait til they say you can enjoy your food.

960 Great restaurant right in the heart of the Myeongdong area of Seoul. Decided to try it based on the close proximity to where we are staying and the line out the front (see pic).

We went around 18:00 and there was no line out front, but by the time we left at around 19:30 there was a line of locals down the street.

The menue had an English translation which made it really easy to understand what we were ordering. The 2 of us got 2x orders of the chicken and octopus Galbi with 2x sides of rice and 1x serve of cheese. Our waitress then proceeded to prepare the food right in front of us in a giant bbq built into our table, by progressively adding the rice and cheese into the bbq.

The meal itself took about 15-20 minutes all up to prepare and was very filling and absolutely delicious! If you like chilli food the way we do then you won't be disappointed.

The prices were also really reasonable (at least by Australian standards). Would recommend and go again.

961 We ordered the cheese chicken galbi + noodles, and they provided us bibs, then proceeded to cook the meat/prepare the meal for us.

The taste is okay, but its not a fancy place. The food is pretty basic.

The free sides at the bar, are very blah. . .shredded cabbage, radish and kimchee. Ugh.

They don't even provide rice when you order the chicken.

For the price you can get a much better meal somewhere else.

967 It was a pleasant experience all in all. We were handed aprons when we sat down at our tables, to prevent clothing stains; febreeze are provided as well after you're done with eating.

However, instructions were not given well as to what we were supposed to do once the dakgalbi arrived. My friends and I were confused for a moment on whether we had to cook it by ourselves or if we had to wait for the staff to help us with it. Not a big issue, as we observed what the other customers did.

The food was slightly spicy (for me, cause I can't take spice well), but my other friends enjoyed it very much. But after eating it together with lots of cheese, I overcame the spiciness, and was able to enjoy the meal as well!

970 Right at the middle of Myeongdong, this famous dakgalbi restaurant attracts lots of tourists, anytime of the day. The restaurant is kinda dirty and smokey and the seats are very very near to each other, it feels crampy and uncomfortable.

The dakgalbi here is pretty good, there are some varieties you can choose from or add some ingredients to the basic dish. Cheese is recommended. Staff here is not friendly and always very busy, not very attentive either. The price here is more expensive compared to other branches.

I would recommend people to go to other less touristy branches for better service, food quality and price.

After we had sat down and looked at the menu, it did take a while for staff to approach us and take our order. We ordered three portions of beansprout galbi, one portion of rice and an extra portion of sweet potato tteokbokki. Staff would come over every few minutes to stir and make sure the food was cooked. As the food is cooking in front of you, you are treated to the most wonderful smell! It tasted great, not as spicy as it looks, and the portions were more than enough for us. You can help yourself to pickled radish, cabbage and sauces at the back of the restaurant. Definitely worth eating there!

973 We had a wonder and delicious dak galbi here. The restaurant itself is right in Myeongdong and gets very busy at night. The staff is friendly and provides an english menu and aprons for eating.

The dak galbi is cooked in front of you and you don't have to do anything to it! You can help yourself to Korean veggies, lettuce and kimchi at a self service station and the staff provides you with water. The overall spice level isn't too bad, but I believe you can request it to be higher. You can also add additional meats and cheese to your meal if you want.

We would definitely recommend going here if you're in Seoul!

975 Yoogane is scattered all across seoul, and it serves a really decent tasting meal. Coupled with its salad bar. The food is cooked in front of you and you're given aprons to wear during the meal. Thumbs up to them as white shirts can be saved.

They have a new dish which is cheese fondue with the chicken. I didn't have that.. but i'd like to try it as it looks really good and is a few won more only.

Get the sticky noodles and not the ramen if you want some carbs. They fry it in with the chicken!

979 I came here for lunch and the restaurant was quite crowded. But we still got table thanks to the fast response staff. Every one coming here must order food. One of my friend didn't feel to eat but the staff said that us three must order food. Okay..then we ordered 3 portion of fried rice with extra topping of mozarella cheese. The taste was good. At first it looked like the portion is small, but after you start to eat, you'll feel full easily. There were free water and side dishes like simple salad and radishes too.
The staff will also help you cook the ordered food. If you order chicken galbi, first they will pour the ingredients(chicken, toppoki, vegetables) on the hot pan on your table. You won't know what to do next with that thing, but don't worry because in 5-7 minutes later a staff will cook it for you and you can eat it then.

982 I was caught up in the middle of lunch time in Myeongdong shopping district and i am super starving that very moment. Seen this Yoogane Restaurant that I kept seeing in Korean drama "Twenty Again", out of curiousity and because so many people keep coming and going plus my growling stomach really pushing me to go inside, i found myself sitting not knowing what and how i will order :) Good thing their staffs are all friendly and so nice to tell me the good ones they have and enough portion for solo customer like me. I have chosen marinated chicken galbi fried rice since I need a heavy meal. Just so timing i'm in a very cold weather hence I'm just so excited to know that it is a bit spicy but I was wrong 'cos it is actually very spicy when I tasted it. The awesome part was, the staff who assisted me is so kind enough to cook it in front of me and I never regret having it as the dish is impeccably delish. Excellent i had a meal for just 6000 won or 6 dollars!

986 We had Marinated seafood fried rice which a mix of octopus strips,
kimchi cabbage, korean paste, seaweed, korean rice and lots of vegies. Which cost us 5,000 won. Not bad for a whole pan full of fried rice and unlimited refill of side dishes (kimchi radish, cabbage, kimchi soup and drinks)

987 We came after reading the good reviews. This place is packed and buzzing. We went for the seafood and chicken dish with extra rice for two people for about 30,000w. It was great to see the food cooked at your table, it was fast service. Food was amazing, like spicy paella. We went back three times in our visit as it was the best place by far! Definitely go.

989 Visited this place for their one pot meal, they'll set a big pan with vegetables, chicken, chilli paste on your table, and staff will stir fry till well done. Quite a experience. You can add portion of rice, ramen, cheese to suit your taste. Around 10,000W per head, and upwards.

990 This is one of the alternative for Muslim tourist where they can try Yoogane's seafood fried rice. The side dishes are free flow and you can help yourself as much as you can (but do not waste). Its a little crowded as the tables are quite near to one another and have a loud environment. The food is a little bit spicy for average kind of person.

Note: Each person MUST order one set (means you cant eat 2 person and order one set to share) - and apart from rice you can add in ramyun as well.

992 Writing this as the dakgalbi is cooking. Poor first impression, lousy service, forced ordering already gave a bad taste even before i bite into my first piece of chicken.

You'd rather go to a less popular dakgalbi restaurant than give your $ to a restaurant that thinks its too popular to forget about service quality and overall customer experience.

993 Love the food here and the service was good. You can choose to mix and match sides with the main dak galbi choice. Best of all, it's easy on the wallet too.

994 For our first meal in Korea, our companion accompanied and suggested this place to us.

They have unlimited salad and kimchi. The food is ok. A big pan of rice with toppings of your choice, then they'll cook it in front of you. (Price range 5k won per person), if you're not a rice person this will be too much for you.

The servers can speak passable English.

996 Its quite hard to find Halal Restaurant in Seoul, unless you go to Itaewon. But, this restaurant offer no pork dishes in all of his menu. We order Seafood Fried rice which is quite tasty.

997 The taste of food is nice and the price is reasonable. However, the service not really nice. All the staff work like zombie. All the shop no one can speak either english or chinese. We want to change rice from normal rice to fried rice because we order wrongly, the guy staff said no no!! And left without help anything. Only a guy who wear shirt which I thought he's the manager help us change and cook for us.

998 My family, 5 of us, decided to to gave Dak agalbi so i decided to go to Yoogani here in Myeongdong. It was about 2pm.... The waiters did not even offer us seats when there were so many tables available.... we wanted to look at the menu but they did not even offer us the menu. I had to get menu myself... This was my second time in Korea & this was the worst experience! They seem not in the mood to entertain the guests coming in. We've been calling their attention but they jst ignored our calls! They were do RUDE!!! Very poor service!!! We all just decided to walked out onstead of having our food there! Seems lije they do not lije foreigners entering their restaurant.

999 We visited Yoogane for lunch one Sunday. The staff who attended to us were very pleasant and helpful. If at all, they didn't speak English very much and perhaps that's why they may come across as unfriendly.
We had chicken and small octopus for 3, and 1 portion of fried rice. It turned out to be just nice for 3 hungry adults.

1000 Don't worry if you can't find - there are 3( I think so...) restaurants in myeongdong shopping area. The spicy chicken can be really hot. We tried the cheese version, it was really yummy.

How to order? Just point at menu and sit back - the restaurant staff will cook for you.
